      "                            \tScene:<br/><br/>A neighbourhood on a street called Privet Drive. An owl, sitting on the street sign flies off to reveal a mysterious appearing old man walking through a forest near the street. He stops at the start of the street and takes out a mechanical device and zaps all the light out of the lampposts. He puts away the device and a cat meows. The man, ALBUS DUMBLEDORE, looks down at the cat, which is a tabby and is sitting on a brick ledge.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Dumbledore: I should have known that you would be here...Professor McGonagall.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The cat meows, sniffs out and the camera pans back to a wall. The cats shadow is seen progressing into a human. There are footsteps and MINERVA MCGONAGALL is revealed.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>McGonagall: Good evening, Professor Dumbledore. Are the rumours true, Albus?<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Dumbledore: I'm afraid so, Professor. The good, and the bad.<br/><br/>McGonagall: And the boy?<br/><br/>Dumbledore: Hagrid is bringing him.<br/><br/>McGonagall: Do you think it wise to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?<br/><br/>Albus: Ah, Professor, I would trust Hagrid with my life.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>There is a motor sound, and the two professors look up to see a flying motorcycle coming down from the air. It skids on the street and halts. A large man, RUBEUS HAGRID, takes off his goggles.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hagrid: Professor Dumbledore, Sir. Professor McGonagall.<br/><br/>Dumbledore: No problems, I trust, Hagrid?<br/><br/>Hagrid: No, sir. Little tyke fell asleep just as we were flying over Bristol. Heh. Try not to wake him. There you go.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hagrid hands a baby in a blanket over to Dumbledore.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>McGonagall: Albus, do you really think its safe, leaving him with these people? I've been watching them all day. They're the worst sort of Muggles imaginable. They really are<br/><br/>Dumbledore: The only family he has.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>They stop outside a house.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>McGonagall: This boy will be famous. There wont be a child in our world who doesn't know his name.<br/><br/>Dumbledore: Exactly. He's better off growing up away from all that. Until he is ready.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hagrid coughs and sniffles, he is crying. He clears his throat.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Dumbledore: There, there, Hagrid. It's not really good-bye, after all.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hagrid nods. Dumbledore takes a letter and places it on the baby, who is now at the foot of the door. The baby has a visible lightning-bolt shaped scar on his forehead.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Dumbledore: Good luck...Harry Potter.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The camera pans into the scar and the opening title shows:<br/><br/>HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE<br/><br/><br/>Almost ten years after the: DURSLEY's home. The camera pans on a sleeping boy, almost eleven, with a lightning-bolt shaped scar on his forehead.<br/><br/>There is a click, and knocking. Outside, a tall woman, PETUNIA DURSLEY, raps the door.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Petunia: Up. Get up. {Knocks} {sighs} Now! {Smacks door of closet which is the boys bedroom}<br/><br/> <br/><br/>A large, tubby boy, DUDLEY DURSLEY, suddenly comes running down the stairs above the closet. He stops half-way down and goes back, jumping on the staircase.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Dudley: Wake up, cousin! We're going to the zoo!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Dudley laughs, comes down the stairs and runs for the kitchen. The boy, HARRY POTTER, tries to come out of the closet, but is pushed back in by Dudley.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Petunia is in the kitchen, where Dudley has gone.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Petunia: Oh, here he comes, the birthday boy!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>A larger man, VERNON DURSLEY, is sitting at the kitchen table.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Vernon: Happy birthday, son.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Petunia and Dudley giggle together. Harry comes into the kitchen, dressed in rags.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Petunia: Why don't you just cook the breakfast, and try not to burn anything.<br/><br/>Harry: Yes, Aunt Petunia.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>He sets to work.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Petunia: I want everything to be perfect for my Dudley's special day.<br/><br/>Vernon: Hurry up! Bring my coffee, boy!<br/><br/>Harry: Yes, Uncle Vernon.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Petunia leads Dudley over to the family room, where there are a vast amount of presents. Dudley stares.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Dudley: How many are there?<br/><br/>Vernon: Thirty-six. Counted 'em myself.<br/><br/>Dudley: Thirty-six?! But last year last year I got thirty-seven!!<br/><br/>Vernon: Yes, well, some of them are quite a bit bigger than last year!<br/><br/>Dudley: I don't care how big they are!<br/><br/>Petunia: Oh, now, now, now. This is what we're going to do, is that when we go out we're going to buy you two new presents! How's that, Pumpkin?<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene:<br/><br/>Outside, morning. The happy family is heading to the car. Harry goes to get in but is stopped by Vernon.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Petunia: This will be a lovely day at the zoo. I'm really looking forward to it.<br/><br/>Vernon: I'm warning you now, boy. Any funny business, any at all, and you won't have any meals for a week. Get in.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene:<br/><br/>The zoo. The family is in the reptile house, looking at a large BOA CONSTRICTOR.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Dudley: Make it move.<br/><br/>Vernon raps the glass of the cage.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Vernon: Move!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Dudley raps the glass much harder, and Vernon winces.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Dudley: MOVE!<br/><br/>Harry: He's asleep!<br/><br/>Dudley: He's boring.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Dudley and his parents retreat to another enclosure. Harry is left with the snake.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry: Sorry about him. He doesn't understand what it's like, lying there day after day, having people press their ugly faces in on you.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The snake looks up and blinks.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry: Can you...hear me? {The snake nods} It's just...I've never talked to a snake before. Do you...I mean...do you talk to people often? {The snake shakes its head} You're from Burma, aren't you? Was it nice there, do you miss your family? {The snake turns its head in the direction of a sign which says, Bred in Captivity} I see. That's me as well. I never knew my parents, either.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The now awake snake has attracted Dudley's attention. He rips over to the cage, knocking Harry to the floor.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Dudley: Mummy, dad, come here! You won't believe what this snake is doing!!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Dudley puts his hands on the glass wall. Harry, from the ground, glares at him. Suddenly, the glass disappears. Dudley wretches forward.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Dudley: Whoa! Ahh! Ahh!!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Dudley falls into the snake enclosure, sputtering in a pool of water. The snake gets out of the exhibit, stopping in front of Harry.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Snake: Thankssssssss.<br/><br/>Harry: Anytime.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The snake starts off.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Man: SNAKE!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>There is a lot of screaming as the snake heads for freedom. Dudley gets up to get out, but the glass is now back over the enclosure. He is stuck. He pounds the glass.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Dudley: Mum, mummy!<br/><br/>Petunia: {Sees him} AHH!<br/><br/>Dudley: Mum, help! Help me!<br/><br/>Petunia: My darling boy! How did you get in there?!<br/><br/>Harry: {Grins and giggles}<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Vernon glares down at him and Harry's grin disappears. Petunia continues screaming: How did you get in there? Dursley, oh, Dursley!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene:<br/><br/>Back at the Dursley's. Petunia and a bundled up Dudley come in.<br/><br/>Petunia: It's all right. It's all right.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>They disappear around the corner. Harry and Vernon enter. Vernon slams the door and shoves Harry against a wall, taking his hair.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry: Ow!<br/><br/>Vernon: What happened?<br/><br/>Harry: I swear I don't know! One minute the glass was there and then it was gone! It was like magic!<br/><br/>Vernon: {Scoffs and shoves Harry into the closet} There's no such thing as magic!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene:<br/><br/>Outside, some time later. An owl flies by the house and drops a letter, which zooms in the letterbox. It lands away from the house and hoots.<br/><br/>Harry, inside, goes to collect the mail. He sorts through the letters and sees his, addressed to him. He goes into the kitchen, hands Vernon the rest of the mail, and walks around the other side of the table to see his letter.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Vernon: Ah, Marge is ill. Ate a funny whelk.<br/><br/>Dudley: {Sees Harrys letter. He runs and grabs it} Dad, look! Harry's got a letter!!<br/><br/>Harry: Hey, give it back! It's mine!<br/><br/>Vernon: {Laughs} Yours? Who'd be writing to you?<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The family gathers to look at the address. There is a broken seal on the letter. The family looks up and Harry gulps.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene:<br/><br/>Another owl flies by with a letter and drops it off. Inside, Vernon grabs a handful of letters and rips them up.<br/><br/>In the closet, Harry hears a whirring noise. He looks out at Vernon drilling wood over the letterbox opening.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Vernon: No more mail through this letterbox.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene:<br/><br/>Outside, Vernon and Petunia appear. Vernon is about to head off to work. Petunia kisses his cheek.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Petunia: Have a lovely day at the office, dear.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>She stops, looks and sees a bunch of owls.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Vernon: Shoo! Go on!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene:<br/><br/>Inside. Vernon is tossing letters into the fireplace. Harry comes around the corner. Vernon grins evilly and tosses more in.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene:<br/><br/>Living/Family room. The family is sitting around, Harry is serving cookies.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Vernon: Fine day Sunday. In my opinion, best day of the week. Why is that, Dudley?<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Dudley shrugs.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry: {Hands cookie to Vernon} Because there's no post on Sunday? Ah, right you are, Harry. No post on Sunday. Hah! No blasted letters today. No, sir. {Harry sees a shadow outside the window. Outside, millions of owls are perched.} No sir, not one blasted, miserable---<br/><br/> <br/><br/>A letter shoots out of the fireplace and zips across Vernons face. There is a rumbling and then zillions of letters come shooting out of the fireplace.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Dudley: AHH! Make it stop! Please make it stop! {He jumps on Petunias lap}<br/><br/>Petunia and Vernon: {Screaming}<br/><br/>Vernon: Go away, ahh!<br/><br/>Dudley: What is it? Please tell me what's happening!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry jumps onto the coffee table to grab a letter. He gets one and starts to run away. Vernon jumps up as well.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Vernon: Give me that! Give me that letter!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>He chases Harry and grabs him before Harry gets into his closet.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry: Get off! Ahh!<br/><br/>Vernon: Ahh!<br/><br/>Harry: They're my letters! Let go of me!<br/><br/>Vernon: That's it! We're going away! Far away! Where they can't find us!<br/><br/>Dudley: Daddy's gone mad, hasnt he?!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene:<br/><br/>A house, on a rock island somewhere out at sea. The family is sleeping, with Harry on the cold, dirt floor. He has drawn a birthday cake which reads, Happy Birthday Harry. Harry looks at Dudley's watch, which beeps 12:00.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry: Make a wish, Harry. {Blows}<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Suddenly, the door thumps. Harry jumps. The door thumps again and Dudley and Harry jump up and back away. Petunia and Vernon appear, Vernon with a gun. The door bangs again and then cracks open, and a giant man appears.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Vernon: Who's there? Ahh!<br/><br/>Hagrid: Sorry 'bout that. {He puts the door back up}<br/><br/>Vernon: I demand that you leave at once, Sir! You are breaking and entering!<br/><br/>Petunia: Ooh.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hagrid comes over, grabs the gun and bends it upwards.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hagrid: Dry up, Dursley, you great prune. {The gun fires}<br/><br/>All: Ahh!<br/><br/>Hagrid: {sees Dudley} Mind, I haven't seen you since you was a baby, Harry, but you're a bit more along than I would have expected. Particularly 'round the middle!<br/><br/>Dudley: I-I-I'm not Harry.<br/><br/>Harry appears: I-I am.<br/><br/>Hagrid: Oh, well, of course you are! Got something for ya. 'Fraid I might have sat on it at some point! I imagine that it'll taste fine just the same. Ahh. Baked it myself. {Hands Harry the cake} Words and all. Heh.<br/><br/>Harry: Thank you! {Opens cake, which reads: Happee Birdae Harry.}<br/><br/>Hagrid: It's not every day that your young man turns eleven, now is it?<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hagrid sits down on the couch, takes out an umbrella and points it at the empty fire. Poof, poof! Two sparks fly out and the fire starts. The family gapes.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry: {puts cake down} Excuse me, who are you?<br/><br/>Hagrid: Rubeus Hagrid. Keeper of keys and grounds at Hogwarts. Course, you'll know all about Hogwarts.<br/><br/>Harry: Sorry, no.<br/><br/>Hagrid: No? Blimey, Harry, didn't you ever wonder where your mum and dad learned it all?<br/><br/>Harry: Learnt what?<br/><br/>Hagrid: You're a wizard, Harry.<br/><br/>Harry: I-I'm a what?<br/><br/>Harry: A wizard. And a thumping good one at that, I'd wager. Once you train up a little.<br/><br/>Harry: No, you've made a mistake. I can't be...a-a wizard. I mean, I'm just... Harry. Just Harry.<br/><br/>Hagrid: Well, Just Harry, did you ever make anything happen? Anything you couldn't explain when you were angry or scared? {Harry softens his expression} Ah.<br/><br/>Dudley: {whimpers}<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hagrid hands Harry the same letter that has been sent the past while. Harry opens it.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry: Dear, Mr. Potter. We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts' School of Witchcraft and Wizardry!<br/><br/>Vernon: Hell not be going! We swore when we took him in wed put an end to this rubbish!<br/><br/>Harry: You knew?? You knew all along and you never told me?<br/><br/>Petunia: Of course we knew. How could you not be? My perfect sister being who she was. Oh, my mother and father were so proud the day she got her letter. We have a witch in the family. Isn't it wonderful? I was the only one to see her for what she was. A freak! And then she met that Potter, and then she had you, and I knew you'd be just the same, just as strange, just as ... abnormal. And then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up! And we got landed with you.<br/><br/>Harry: Blown up? You told me my parents died in a car crash!<br/><br/>Hagrid: A car crash? A car crash kill James and Lily Potter?<br/><br/>Petunia: We had to tell him something.<br/><br/>Hagrid: It's an outrage! It's a scandal!<br/><br/>Vernon: He'll not be going!<br/><br/>Hagrid: Oh, and I suppose a great Muggle like yourself's going to stop him, are you?<br/><br/>Harry: Muggle?<br/><br/>Hagrid: Non magic folk. This boy's had his name down ever since he was born! He's going to the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world, and he'll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts' has ever seen: Albus Dumbledore.<br/><br/>Vernon: I will not pay for some crackpot old fool to teach him magic tricks!<br/><br/>Hagrid: {whips out umbrella and points it at Vernon} Never insult Albus Dumbledore in front of me.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hagrid sees Dudley eating Harry's cake, and points the umbrella at his rear. A grey tail grows.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Dudley: Ahh!<br/><br/>All: Ahh! {family chases Dudley}<br/><br/>Harry: {laughs}<br/><br/>Hagrid: Oh, um, I'd appreciate if you didn't tell anyone at Hogwarts about that. Strictly speaking, I'm not allowed to do magic.<br/><br/>Harry: {Nods} Okay.<br/><br/>Hagrid: {checks a clock} Ooh, we're a bit behind schedule. Best be off. Unless you'd rather stay, of course. Hmm? {Leaves}<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry grins, looks back, and grins again.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene:<br/><br/>Streets of London. Hagrid and Harry are walking.<br/><br/>Harry: All students must be equipped with...one standard size two pewter cauldron and may bring if they desire either an owl, a cat or a toad. Can we find all this in London?<br/><br/>Hagrid: If you know where to go.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>They go to a corner store and enter, The Leaky Cauldron.<br/><br/>{Music and talking}<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Barkeep Tom: Ah, Hagrid! The usual, I presume?<br/><br/>Hagrid: No thanks, Tom. I'm on official Hogwarts business today. Just helping young Harry here buy his school supplies.<br/><br/>Tom: Bless my soul. It's Harry Potter.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The pub goes silent. A man comes up and shakes Harrys hand.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Man: Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>A witch comes up and shakes Harrys hand, as well.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Witch: Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter. I can't believe I'm meeting you at last.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>A man in robes with a turban on his head appears. It is PROFESSOR QUIRRELL.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Quirrell: Harry P-potter. C-can't tell you how pleased I am to meet you.<br/><br/>Hagrid: Hello, Professor. I didn't see you there. Harry, this is Professor Quirrell. He'll be your Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts.<br/><br/>Harry: Oh, nice to meet you. {Puts out hand. Quirrell refuses}<br/><br/>Quirrell: F-fearfully fascinating subject. N-not that you need it, e-eh, Potter? Heheh.<br/><br/>Hagrid: Yes, well, must be going now. Lots to buy. Heh.<br/><br/>Harry: Good-bye.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The two leave into a back room winery in front of a brick wall.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hagrid: See, Harry, you're famous!<br/><br/>Harry: But why am I famous, Hagrid? All those people back there, how is it they know who I am?<br/><br/>Hagrid: I'm not exactly sure I'm the right person to tell you that, Harry. {Taps the brick wall clockwise with his umbrella. The blocks shift and open up to reveal a hidden, busy street.}<br/><br/>Welcome, Harry, to Diagon Alley.  <br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry grins broadly as they step into the street and walk down it. An owl screeches.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hagrid: Here's where you'll get your quills and ink, and over there all your bits and bobs for doing your wizardry.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry is amazed as they pass by shops and owls and bats. The camera pans on a broom store, where a group of boys are crowded around a shiny broom.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Boy: It's a world class racing broom. Look at it, its the new Nimbus 2000! It's the fastest model yet.<br/><br/>Harry: But, Hagrid, how am I to pay for all this? I haven't any money.<br/><br/>Hagrid: Well there's your money, Harry. Gringotts, the Wizard Bank. T'aint no place safer, 'cept perhaps Hogwarts.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Inside the bank, they walk down the shiny aisle, passing tiny creatures working.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry: Uh, Hagrid, what exactly are those things?<br/><br/>Hagrid: They're goblins, Harry. Clever as they come goblins but not the most friendly of beasts. Best stick close to me. {Harry sticks to him.} {Hagrid clears his throat as they approach a counter with a goblin in it.} Mr. Harry Potter wishes to make a withdrawal.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The goblin looks up.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Goblin: And does Mr. Harry Potter have his key?<br/><br/>Hagrid: Oh. Wait a minute. Got it here somewhere. Hah. Here's the little devil. Oh, and there's something else as well. Professor Dumbledore gave me this. It's about you-know-what in vault you-know-which. {Hands Goblin letter wrapped in string.}<br/><br/>Goblin: Very well.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene:<br/><br/>Racing down the depth caverns in a cartlike structure. The cart stops, a goblin, GRIPHOOK, clambers out.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Griphook: Vault 687. Lamp, please. {Hagrid hands him the lamp and he walks to the vault} Key please. {Hagrid hands him the key and he unlocks it}<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The room is filled nearly top to bottom with coins. Harry is amazed.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hagrid: Didn't think your mum and dad would leave you with nothing, now didja?<br/><br/> <br/><br/>They continue on through the cavern.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Griphook: Vault 713.<br/><br/>Harry: What's in there, Hagrid?<br/><br/>Hagrid: Can't tell you, Harry. It's Hogwarts business. Very secret.<br/><br/>Griphook: Stand back. {Slides finger down the door. Clank. Clank. The vault opens to expose a small white stone package. Hagrid hurries in and scoops it up. The eerie light it was shining with disappears.}<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hagrid: Best not mention this to anyone, Harry.<br/><br/>Harry nods.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene: Outside in the street, walking.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry: I still need...a wand.<br/><br/>Hagrid: A wand? Well, you'll want Ollivanders. No place better. Run along there, but wait. I just got one more thing I got to do. Won't be long.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry goes into the store, quietly. He looks around. There are shelves of wands, but no people.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry: {Softly} Hello? Hello?<br/><br/> <br/><br/>There is a thunk. A man appears on a ladder and looks at Harry. He smiles.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Ollivander: I wondered when I'd be seeing you, Mr. Potter. It seems only yesterday that your mother and father were in here buying their first wands. {Picks a wand} Ah. Here we are. {Harry holds it but just stands} Well, give it a wave.<br/><br/>Harry: Oh! {waves. All the shelves come crashing down. Harry jumps and hurriedly puts the wand back on the counter.}<br/><br/>Ollivander: Apparently not. {Gets another wand.} Perhaps this. {Harry waves at a vase, which blows apart.} No, no, definitely not! No matter...{gets a wand} I wonder. {Hands wand to Harry. Harry glows under it.} Curious, very curious.<br/><br/>Harry: Sorry, but what's curious?<br/><br/>Ollivander: I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr. Potter. It just so happens that the phoenix, whose tail feather resides in your wand gave one other feather, just one. It is curious that you should be destined for this wand when its brother gave you that scar. {Points to scar}<br/><br/>Harry: And...who owned that wand?<br/><br/>Ollivander: Oh, we do not speak his name. The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter. It's not always clear why, but I think it is clear that we can expect great things from you. After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things...terrible, yes, but great. {Hands Harry his wand.}<br/><br/> <br/><br/>There is a knock on the window.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hagrid: Harry! Harry! Happy birthday! {Has a snowy owl in a cage which hoots.}<br/><br/>Harry: Wow.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene: Later, eating supper. The two, Hagrid and Harry, are at a long table, eating soup.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hagrid: You all right, Harry? You seem very quiet.<br/><br/>Harry: He killed my parents, didn't he? The one who gave me this. You know, Hagrid, I know you do.<br/><br/>Hagrid: {Sighs and pushes bowl away} First, and understand this, Harry, 'cause it's very important. Not all wizards are good. Some of them go bad. A few years ago there was one wizard who went as bad as you can go. And his name was V-...his name was V-...<br/><br/>Harry: Maybe if you wrote it down?<br/><br/>Hagrid: No, I can't spell it. All right. His name was Voldemort.<br/><br/>Harry: Voldemort?<br/><br/>Hagrid: Shh!!<br/><br/>{Harry looks around}<br/><br/> <br/><br/>A flashback ensues, consisting off a cloaked man walking towards a house, breaking in with his wand, and proceeding to terrorize. Hagrid narrates.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hagrid: It was dark times, Harry, dark times. Voldemort started to gather some followers, brought 'em over to the dark side. Anyone that stood up to him ended up dead. Your parents fought against him, but nobody lived once he decided to kill 'em. {Harrys mother, LILY, screams as she is killed by Voldemorts wand} Nobody...not one. Except you. {close-up of baby Harry.}<br/><br/>Harry: Me? Voldemort tried to kill...me?<br/><br/>Hagrid: Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut on your forehead, Harry. A mark like that only comes from being touched by a curse...and an evil curse at that.<br/><br/>Harry: What happened to Vo-...to You-Know-Who?<br/><br/>Hagrid: Some say he died. Codswallop in my opinion. Nope, I reckon he's out there, still, too tired to go on. But one thing's absolutely certain. Something about you stumped him that night. That's why you're famous, Harry. That's why everbody knows your name. You're the boy who lived.<br/><br/> <br/><br/><br/> <br/>Scene: London Train Station. Up on a crossing bridge, Harry (with cart and owl) walk beside Hagrid.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>A couple look at Hagrid.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hagrid: What're you looking at? {Looks at watch} Blimey, is that the time?? Sorry, Harry, I'm gonna have to leave you. Dumbledore'll be wanting his...well, he'll be wanting to see me. Now, uh, your train leaves in 10 minutes. Here's your ticket. Stick to it, Harry that's very important. Stick to your ticket.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry looks at his golden ticket.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry: Platform 9 ¾? But Hagrid, there must be a mistake. This says Platform 9 ¾. There's no such thing...is there? {Harry looks up and Hagrid has vanished.}<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene: Harry is walking down lane between trains. A man rushes by.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Man: Sorry.<br/><br/>Harry sees a train master.<br/><br/>Harry: Excuse me, excuse me.<br/><br/>Trainmaster: {talking to woman and child} Right on your left, ma'am.<br/><br/>Harry: Excuse me, Sir. Can you tell me where I might find Platform 9 ¾?<br/><br/>Trainmaster: 9 ¾? Think youre being funny, do ya? {Leaves}<br/><br/> <br/><br/>A woman, daughter, and four boys walk by, pushing carts.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Mrs. Weasley: It's the same year after year. Always packed with Muggles, of course.<br/><br/>Harry: Muggles?<br/><br/>Mrs. Weasley: Come on. Platform 9 ¾ this way! All right, Percy, you first.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>A tall boy with red hair comes forward and runs towards a brick wall. Amazingly, he disappears right into it. Harry is amazed.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Mrs. Weasley: Fred, you next.<br/><br/>George: He's not Fred, I am!<br/><br/>Fred: Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother!<br/><br/>Mrs. Weasley: Oh, I'm sorry, George.<br/><br/>Fred: I'm only joking. I am Fred. {He runs through the wall, and is followed by his twin brother.}<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry shakes his head in disbelief.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry: Excuse me! C-could you tell me how to<br/><br/>Mrs. Weasley: How to get on the platform? Yes, not to worry, dear. It's Ron's first time to Hogwarts as well. {pan to a red haired boy who smiles} Now, all you've got to do is walk straight at the wall between platforms 9 and 10. Best do it at a bit of a run if youre nervous.<br/><br/>Ginny (daughter): Good luck.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry takes a breath and runs at the wall. He shuts his eyes and emerges on the other side a magnificent station with a red train and bundles of people. A whistle blows, and Harry sighs with relief.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene: The train is traveling through unknown country. Pan to inside compartment, where Harry is sitting. The red headed boy, RON, appears, dirt on his nose.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Ron: Excuse me, do you mind? Everywhere else is full.<br/><br/>Harry: No, not at all.<br/><br/>Ron: {sits across from Harry} I'm Ron, by the way. Ron Weasley.<br/><br/>Harry: I'm Harry. Harry Potter.<br/><br/>{Ron goes agape.}<br/><br/>Ron: So-so it's true?! I mean, do you really have the...the...<br/><br/>Harry: The what?<br/><br/>Ron: {whispers} Scar...?<br/><br/>Harry: Oh, yeah. {lifts up hair}<br/><br/>Ron: Wicked.<br/><br/>A trolley comes by the compartment, full of sweets.<br/><br/>Woman: Anything off the trolley, dears?<br/><br/>Ron: {Holds up mushed sandwiches} No, thanks, I'm all set. {smacks lips.}<br/><br/>Harry: {pulls out coins} We'll take the lot!<br/><br/>Ron: Whoa!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene: Eating bundles of sweets.<br/><br/>Ron's rat, Scabbers, is perched on Ron's knee, a box over its head.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry: Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans?<br/><br/>Ron: They mean every flavour! There's chocolate and peppermint, and there's also spinach, liver and tripe. George sweared he got a bogey-flavoured one once!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry quickly takes the bean he was chewing out of his mouth.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry: {picks up blue and gold package} These aren't real chocolate frogs, are they?<br/><br/>Ron: It's only a spell. Besides, it's the cards you want. Each pack's got a famous witch or wizard. I got about 500 meself.<br/><br/>Frog: Ribbit. {The frog jumps onto the window and climbs up, then leaps out the window...disappearing.}<br/><br/>Ron: Oh, that's rotten luck. They've only got one good jump in them to begin with.<br/><br/>Harry: Hey, I got Dumbledore!<br/><br/>Ron: I got about 6 of him.<br/><br/>Harry: Hey, he's gone!<br/><br/>Ron: Well, you can't expect him to hang around all day, can you? {Scabbers squeaks} This is Scabbers, by the way, pitiful, isn't he?<br/><br/>Harry: Just a little bit.<br/><br/>Ron: Fred gave me a spell as to turn him yellow. Want to see?<br/><br/>Harry: Yeah!<br/><br/>Ron: {clears throat} Ahem. Sun-<br/><br/> <br/><br/>A girl, HERMIONE GRANGER, with bushy brown hair appears at the doorway.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hermione: Has anyone seen a toad? A boy named Neville's lost one.<br/><br/>Ron: No.<br/><br/>Hermione: Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see then.<br/><br/>Ron: Aghhhemm. Sunshine, daises, butter mellow, turn this stupid fat rat yellow!<br/><br/>{Zap. Nothing happens. Ron shrugs.}<br/><br/>Hermione: Are you sure that's a real spell? Well, it's not very good, is it? Of course I've only tried a few simple spells myself, and they've all worked for me. For example...{Hermione goes over and sits across from Harry. He points her hand at his glasses and Harry tenses} Oculus Reparo. {The glasses, which noseband is battered, are repaired. Harry takes them off, amazed.} That's better, isn't it? Holy Cricket, you're Harry Potter. I'm Hermione Granger...and you are...?<br/><br/>Ron: {full mouth} I'm...Ron Weasley.<br/><br/>Hermione: Pleasure. You two better change into your robes. I expect we'll be arriving soon. {Gets up and leaves, then comes back and looks at Ron.} You've got dirt, on your nose, by the way, did you know? Just there. {Points} {Ron scratches his nose, embarrassed.}<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene: Darkness, the train blows its whistle and pulls into an outdoor station. Hagrid walks along the side aisle, with a lantern. People begin pouring out of the train.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hagrid: Right, then! First years! This way, please! Come on, now, don't be shy! Come on now, hurry up!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry and Ron walk up to Hagrid.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hagrid: Hello, Harry.<br/><br/>Harry: Hey, Hagrid.<br/><br/>Ron: Whoaa!<br/><br/>Hagrid: Right then. This way to the boats! Come on, now, follow me.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene:<br/><br/>A number of boats are plugging across a vast lake, where up ahead a huge castle can be seen. People are in awe.<br/><br/>Ron: Wicked.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene: On a higher level, Professor McGonagall is waiting. She raps her fingers on a stone railing, and then goes to the top of the stairs to greet the newcomers.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>McGonagall: Welcome to Hogwarts. Now, in a few moments, you will pass through these doors and join your classmates. But before you can take your seats you must be sorted into your houses. They are Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin. Now, while you are here, your house will be like your family. Your triumphs will earn you house points. Any rule breaking, and you will lose points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup<br/><br/> <br/><br/>NEVILLE LONGBOTTOM, a scared looking boy, spots his toad sitting near McGonagall. He jumps forward.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Neville: Trevor! {McGonagall stares down at him} Sorry. {He backs away.}<br/><br/>McGonagall: The sorting ceremony will begin momentarily. {leaves}<br/><br/> <br/><br/>DRACO MALFOY, a slicked back evil looking boy speaks up.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Draco: It's true then, what they're saying on the train. Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts. {Students whisper, Harry Potter?} This is Crabbe, and Goyle {nods to thugs} and I'm Malfoy...Draco Malfoy. {Ron snickers at his name} Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask yours. Red hair, and a hand me down robe? You must be a Weasley. Well soon find that some wizarding families are better than others, Potter. Dont want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there. {extends hand.}<br/><br/>Harry: I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Draco glares. McGonagall returns and smacks him on the shoulder with a paper. He retreats with one last glare.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>McGonagall: We're ready for you now.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>She leads everyone through two large doors and into the Great Hall, where there are four long tables with many kids, as well as floating candles. The roof appears to be the sky.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hermione: It's not real, the ceiling. It's just bewitched to look like the night sky. I read about it in Hogwarts: A History.<br/><br/>McGonagall: All right, will you wait along here, please? Now, before we begin, Professor Dumbldedore would like to say a few words.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Dumbledore rises from the main table.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Dumbledore: I have a few start of term notices I wish to announce. The first years please note that the dark forest is strictly forbidden to all students. Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch {signals to ragged old man with a cat with red eyes} has asked me to remind you that the 3rd floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a most painful death. Thank you.<br/><br/>McGonagall: When I call your name, you will come forth, I shall place the sorting hat on your head, and you will be sorted into your houses. Hermione Granger.<br/><br/>Hermione: Oh, no. Okay, relax. {She goes up}<br/><br/>Ron: Mental that one, I'm telling you.<br/><br/>Harry nods in agreement.<br/><br/>Sorting Hat: Ah, right then...hmm...right. Okay...Gryffindor!!<br/><br/>(Cheering)<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hermione jumps off with a smile.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>McGonagall: Draco Malfoy.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Draco saunters up proudly. The tattered hat nearly freaks before touching down on Dracos head.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Sorting Hat: SLYTHERIN!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Ron: There isn't a witch or wizard who went bad who wasnt in Slytherin.<br/><br/>McGonagall: Susan Bones.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>A small, redhead goes up.<br/><br/>Harry looks around and spots a black haired, pale teacher, SEVERUS SNAPE, looking at him. His scar hurts.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry: Ahh! {puts hand on forehead}<br/><br/>Ron: Harry, what is it?<br/><br/>Harry: Nothing...it's nothing, I'm fine.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Sorting Hat: Let's see...I know...Hufflepuff!<br/><br/>McGonagall: Ronald Weasley.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Ron gulps and walks up. He sits down and the hat is put on.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Sorting Hat: Ah! Another Weasley. I know just where to put you...Gryffindor!!<br/><br/>Ron: {Sighs}<br/><br/>(Cheering)<br/><br/> <br/><br/>McGonagall: Harry Potter.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Everything goes silent. Harry walks up and sits down.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Sorting Hat: Hmm...difficult, very difficult. Plenty of courage I see, not a bad mind, either. There's talent, oh yes, and a thirst to prove yourself. But where to put you?<br/><br/>Harry: {whispers} Not Slytherin. Not Slytherin.<br/><br/>Sorting Hat: Not Slytherin, eh? Are you sure? You could be great, you know. Its all here in your head. And Slytherin will help you on your way to greatness! There's no doubt about that! No? {Harry whispers: Not Slytherin...anything but Slytherin} Well, if youre sure...better be...GRYFFINDOR!!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>There is an immense cheering and Harry goes to the Gryffindor table.<br/><br/>Fred and George are also there, and cheer: We got Potter! We got Potter! Harry sits down.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>McGonagall: {dings on a cup} Your attention, please.<br/><br/>Dumbledore: Let the feast...begin.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Food magically appears on all the tables, and the hall is filled with awe and chatter.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry: Wow.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Draco looks at all the food, raises his eyebrows and digs in.<br/><br/>Ron stuffs his face.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>SEAMUS FINNIGAN, a tiny boy, speaks.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Seamus: I'm half and half. Me dad's a Muggle. Mam's a witch. Bit of a nasty shock for him when he found out.<br/><br/>Neville laughs.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry is sitting next to Percy. He leans over.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry: Say, Percy, who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?<br/><br/>Percy: Oh, that's Professor Snape, head of Slytherin house.<br/><br/>Harry: What's he teach?<br/><br/>Percy: Potions. But everyone knows it's the Dark Arts he fancies. He's been after Quirrells job for years.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Ron, having just finished a chicken wing, reaches into the bowl for more, and a ghostly head, SIR NICHOLAS, pops out.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Ron: Ahh!<br/><br/>Nick: Hello! How are you? Welcome to Gryffindor.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Numerous ghosts come pouring from the walls, sailing along.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hufflepuff ghost: Whoo-hoo-hoo!<br/><br/>Girl: Look, its the Bloody Baron!<br/><br/>Percy: Hello, Sir Nicholas. Have a nice summer?<br/><br/>Nick: Dismal. Once again, my request to join the headless hunt has been denied. {Begins to leave}<br/><br/>Ron: Hey, I know you! You're Nearly Headless Nick!<br/><br/>Nick: I prefer Sir Nicholas if you don't mind.<br/><br/>Hermione: Nearly headless? How can you be nearly headless?<br/><br/>Nick: Like this. {Grabs head and pulls it to the side. His head is hanging on just by a thread.}<br/><br/>Ron: Ahh!<br/><br/>Hermione: Eugh.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene:<br/><br/>Percy is leading the Gryffindors to the staircases.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Percy: Gryffindors, follow me please. Keep up. Thank you.<br/><br/>Boy: Ravenclaw, follow me. This way.<br/><br/>Percy: This is the most direct path to the dormitories. Oh, and keep an eye on the staircases...they like to change.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The camera pans up and we see a vast amount of staircases, people walking on them, and some switching places.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Percy: Keep up, please, and follow me. Quickly now, come on. Come on. {They begin walking up the stairs}<br/><br/>Neville: Seamus, that picture's moving!<br/><br/>Ron: Look at that one, Harry!<br/><br/>Harry: I think she fancies you.<br/><br/>Girl: Oh, look! Look! Who's that girl?<br/><br/>Man in painting: Welcome to Hogwarts.<br/><br/>Girl: Who's that?<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene:<br/><br/>Approaching the Gryffindor dorms. They come up to a large painting of a large woman in a pink dress.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Woman: Password?<br/>Percy: Caput Draconis. {The woman nods and the painting opens to reveal a gape in the wall.} Follow me, everyone. Keep up, quickly, come on.<br/><br/>Girl: Oh, wow.<br/><br/>Percy: {Inside common room} Gather 'round here. Welcome to the Gryffindor Common Room. Boys' dormitories, upstairs and down to your left. Girls, the same on your right. You'll find that your belongings have already been brought up.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene: Mid-night. Harry is sitting by a window in his pj's, with his owl, Hedwig. He pets the owl and looks out the window, sighing with content.<br/><br/> <br/><br/><br/> <br/>Scene: Morning. Harry and Ron are running through the stone halls to their class. They rush in. In the class, a tabby cat is sitting on a desk.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Ron: Whew, amazing, can you imagine the look on old McGonagall's face if we were late?<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The cat jumps off the desk and turns into Professor McGonagall. The two boys are amazed.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Ron: That was bloody brilliant.<br/><br/>McGonagall: Thank you for that assessment, Mr. Weasley. Maybe if I were to transfigure Mr. Potter and yourself into a pocketwatch, maybe one of you would be on time.<br/><br/>Harry: We got lost.<br/><br/>McGonagall: Then perhaps a map? I trust you don't need one to find your seats.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene: Snape's potions class. The students are chattering, sitting near steaming cauldrons. The door slams open and Snape comes rushing in.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Snape: There will be no foolish wand waving or silly incantations in this class. As such, I don't expect many of you to enjoy the subtle science and exact art that is potion making. However, for those select few {looks at Draco, who smiles}, who possess the predisposition, I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses. I can tell you how to bottle fame, brew glory and even put a stopper {Draco looks on} in death. {Draco raises his eyebrows.} {Snape sees Harry, writing this down, in, his view, not paying attention.} Then again, maybe some of you have come to Hogwarts in possession of abilities so formidable that you feel confidant enough to not...pay...attention.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hermione nudges Harry in the ribs. He looks up.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Snape: Mr. Potter. Our...new...celebrity. Tell me, what would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood? {Hermione's hand skyrockets. Harry shrugs.} You don't know? Well, let's try again. Where, Mr. Potter, would you look if I asked you to find me a bezoar? {Hermione's hand shoots up again.}<br/><br/>Harry: I don't know, Sir.<br/><br/>Snape: And what is the difference between Monkshood and Wolfbane?<br/><br/>Harry: I don't know, Sir.<br/><br/>Snape: Pity. Clearly, fame isn't everything, is it, Mr. Potter?<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene: In the great hall, probably midday. The students are all working on homework.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Seamus is trying a spell on a cup.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Seamus: Eye of rabbit, harp string hum. Turn this water, into rum. {Looks in cup and shakes head.} Eye of rabbit, harp string hum...<br/><br/>Harry: What's Seamus trying to do to that glass of water?<br/><br/>Ron: Turn it into rum. Actually managed a weak tea yesterday, before...<br/><br/> <br/><br/>ZAPOOF! The cup explodes. There is laughter amongst the students. Suddenly, a flock of owls start coming into the hall from the rafters above.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Ron: Ah. Mail's here!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The owls soar by, dropping parcels to students. Harry gets nothing. He sees the newspaper Ron has put down.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry: Can I borrow this? {Ron nods} Thanks.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Neville is unwrapping a gift. It is a clear ball with gold around it.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Seamus: Hey, look! Neville's got a Remembrall!<br/><br/>Hermione: I've read about those. When the smoke turns red {the smoke turns red}, it means you've forgotten something.<br/><br/>Neville: The only problem is, I can't remember what I've forgotten.<br/><br/>Harry: Hey, Ron, somebody broke into Gringotts. Listen, Believed to be the work of dark witches or wizards unknown, Gringotts goblins, while acknowledging the breach, insist that nothing was taken. The vault in question, number 713, had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. That's odd. That's the vault Hagrid and I went to.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene: Outside, flying practice. The students, Gryffindor and Slytherin, are lined up in two rows with brooms by their sides. The teacher, MADAM HOOCH, comes down the line. She has short hair and hawk yellow eyes.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hooch: Good afternoon, class.<br/><br/>Class: Good afternoon, Madam Hooch.<br/><br/>Hooch: Good afternoon, Amanda, good afternoon. {to class} Welcome to your first flying lesson. Well, what are you waiting for? Everyone step up to the left side of their broomstick. Come on now, hurry up. Stick your right hand over the broom and say, Up!<br/><br/>Class: Up!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry's broom flies into his hand.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry: Whoa. {Hermione stares as the class continues.}<br/><br/>Draco: Up! {broomstick flies up and Draco smugly grins.}<br/><br/>Hooch: With feeling!<br/><br/>Hermione: Up. Up. Up. Up.<br/><br/>Ron: Up!! {His broom flies up and conks him on the nose} Ow! {Harry laughs} Shut up, Harry. {laughs}<br/><br/>Hooch: Now, once you've got hold of your broom, I want you to mount it. And grip it tight, you don't want to be sliding off the end. {Class mounts} When I blow my whistle, I want each of you to kick off from the ground, hard. Keep your broom steady, hover for a moment, and then lean forward slightly and touch back down. On my whistle...3...2...{tweet!}<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Neville immediately lifts off. He looks quite frightened.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Neville: Oh...<br/><br/>Hooch: Mr. Longbottom.<br/><br/>Girl: Neville, what are you doing?<br/><br/>Students: Neville...Neville...<br/><br/>Boy: We're not supposed to take off, yet.<br/><br/>Hooch: {Neville begins soaring away} M-M-Mr. Longbottom Mr. Longbottom!<br/><br/>Neville: AHH!<br/>Hooch: Mr. Longbottom!<br/><br/>Neville: {soars away} Down! Down! Ahhhh!<br/><br/>Harry: Neville! {shouting}<br/><br/>Neville: Help!!!<br/><br/>Hooch: Come back down this instant!<br/><br/>Neville: AHH!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>He soars through the sky and hits a wall, conking along it and then swooping off. All the while, he is screaming. He begins to zoom back towards the group of students. Hooch holds out her wand to stop him.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Neville: Help!<br/><br/>Hooch: Mr. Longbottom! {Neville approaches. The students scatter and Hooch dives out of the way. Neville goes through the scatter and up a tower.}<br/><br/>Neville: Ahhhh! Whoa! Ahhh! {zooms past a statue of a man with a sharp spear. Neville's cloak catches on it. He is flipped off the broom and hangs there.} Oh. Ah...help! {He wavers, then the cloak rips, and he falls, catching on a torch, but then slipping out and falling to the ground.} Ahh!<br/><br/>Hooch: Everyone out of the way! {She runs through the group, and they scatter.} Come on, get up.<br/><br/>Girl: Is he alright?<br/><br/>Neville: Owowowow.<br/><br/>Hooch: Oh, oh, oh, oh dear. It's a broken wrist. Tch, tch, tch. Good boy, come on now, up you get. {Draco reaches down and grabs Neville's Remembrall, which has fallen. Hooch begins to lead Neville away with her.} Everyone's to keep their feet firmly on the ground while I take Mr. Longbottom to the hospital wing. Understand? If I see a single broom in the air, the one riding it will find themselves out of Hogwarts before they can say, Quidditch. {Exit.}<br/><br/>Draco: {snickers} Did you see his face? Maybe if the fat lump had given this a squeeze, he'd have remembered to fall on his fat ass. {Laughs.}<br/><br/>Harry: Give it here, Malfoy.<br/><br/>Draco: No. I think I'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find. {hops on broom and soars around group, then through.} How 'bout up on the roof?? {soars off and hovers high in the sky.} What's the matter, Potter? Bit beyond your reach?<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry grabs his broom and runs to get on it. Hermione stops him.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hermione: Harry, no! You heard what Madam Hooch said! Besides, you don't even know how to fly. {Harry flies off.} What an idiot.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry is now in the air, across from Draco.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry: Give it here, Malfoy, or I'll knock you off your broom!<br/><br/>Draco: Is that so? {Harry makes a dash for him, but Draco twirls around his broom in a 360.} Have it your way, then! {He throws the Remembrall into the air.}<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry zooms after the ball, speeding towards a tower. Just as he is about to hit a window, from which McGonagall is working/watching, he catches it, and then heads back to the group. The students all cheer and run to see him.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Boy: Good job, Harry!<br/><br/>Boy 2: Oh, that was wicked, Harry.<br/><br/>McGonagall: {appears quickly} Harry Potter? Follow me. {Harry sullenly follows her. Draco and his goons laugh.}<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene: Professor Quirrells classroom. He is inside, teaching, holding an iguana.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Quirrell: An iguana s-such as this is {McGonagall approaches the class and stops Harry: You wait here.} an essential in-gredient<br/><br/>McGonagall: Excuse me, excuse me, Professor Quirrell. Could I borrow Wood for a moment?<br/><br/>Quirrell: Oh. Y-yes, of course. {a boy, OLIVER WOOD, gets up to leave and Quirrell continues.} And the vampire b-bat...{eerie roar.}<br/><br/>McGonagall: Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood, I have found you a Seeker!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene: Harry and Ron are walking through crowded halls. Sir Nicholas and a lady ghost float by.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Nick: Have you heard? Harry Potter's the new Gryffindor Seeker. I always knew hed do well.<br/><br/>Ron: Seeker? But first years never make their house teams! You must be the youngest Quidditch player in<br/><br/>Harry: A century, according to McGonagall.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Fred and George approach and walk along with Ron and Harry.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Fred: Hey, well done, Harry, Wood's just told us!<br/><br/>Ron: Fred and George are on the team, too. Beaters.<br/><br/>George: Our job is to make sure that you don't get bloodied up too bad. Can't make any promises, of course. Rough game, Quidditch.<br/><br/>Fred: Brutal. But no one's died in years. Someone will vanish occasionally... {They break off from Harry and Ron, who walk across a courtyard.  <br/><br/>George: But they'll turn up in a month or two!!<br/><br/>Ron: Oh, go on, Harry, Quidditch is great. Best game there is! And you'll be great, too! {Hermione jumps up from her work and comes to join them.}<br/><br/>Harry: But I've never even played Quidditch. What if I make a fool of myself?<br/><br/>Hermione: You won't make a fool of yourself. It's in your blood.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene: The three approach a trophy case. Hermione points at a plaque of Quidditch players. One lists Harry's father as a Seeker.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Ron: Whoa. Harry, you never told me your father was a Seeker, too.<br/><br/>Harry: I-I didn't know.<br/><br/> <br/><br/><br/> <br/>Scene: The three are walking up a staircase. A railing pulls in...Hermione looks, but continues walking.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Ron: I'm telling you, it's spooky. She knows more about you than you do.<br/><br/>Harry: Who doesn't?<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The staircase shudders and begins to move. The three grab the railings.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Ron: Ahh!<br/><br/>Hermione: {Gasps.}<br/><br/>Harry: What's happening?<br/><br/>Hermione: The staircases change, remember? {The staircase stops, in a new place.}<br/><br/>Harry: {taps Ron} Let's go this way.<br/><br/>Ron: Before the staircase moves again. {They all open a door and walk into a spooky, dark room.}<br/><br/>Harry: Does anyone feel like...we shouldn't be here?<br/><br/>Hermione: We're not supposed to be here. This is the 3rd floor. It's forbidden.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Suddenly, a flame lights on a tall stone support. At that moment, the caretaker's cat, MRS. NORRIS, comes running in and meows. The group jumps.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry: Let's go.<br/><br/>{meow}<br/><br/>Ron: It's Filch's cat!<br/><br/>Harry: Run!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The group runs. Flames are lit as they go. They get to the end of the corridor, to a door. Harry grabs the handle, but it's locked.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry: It's locked!<br/><br/>Ron: That's it, we're done for!<br/><br/>Hermione: Oh, move over! {pushes through and pulls out wand} Alohomora. {The door opens.} Get in. {They bustle in.}<br/><br/>Ron: Alohomora?<br/><br/>Hermione: Standard book of spells, Chapter 7.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Filch appears at the start of the corridor with a light. Mrs. Norris looks at him.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Filch: Anyone here, my sweet? {meow} Come on. {exit.}<br/><br/>Hermione: Filch is gone.<br/><br/>Ron: Probably thinks this door's locked.<br/><br/>Hermione: It was locked.<br/><br/>Harry: And for good reason. {Ron and Hermione turn to stand with Harry. There is a massively huge three headed dog sleeping in front of them. The dog, FLUFFY, begins to wake. It growls, yawns, and growls more...noticing the intruders.}<br/><br/>All: AHHHHHHH! {The three bolt, running out of the door. They turn quickly to shut the door and battle against the dog. They get the door shut and run.}<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene:<br/><br/>Back in the Gryffindor room. They are breathless.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Ron: What do they think they're doing?? Keeping a thing like that locked up in a school.<br/><br/>Hermione: You don't use your eyes, do you? Didn't you see what it was standing on?<br/><br/>Ron: I wasn't looking at its feet! I was a bit preoccupied with its heads. Or maybe you didn't notice, there were three! {they begin to climb the stairs to the dorms.}<br/><br/>Hermione: It was standing on a trap door. Which means it wasn't there by accident. It's guarding something.<br/><br/>Harry: Guarding something?<br/><br/>Hermione: That's right. Now, if you two don't mind, I'm going to bed before either of you come up with another clever idea to get us killed...or worse, expelled! {turns and leaves, shutting the door to her dorms.}<br/><br/>Ron: She needs to sort out her priorities!<br/><br/>Harry nods.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene: Outside, day time. Oliver and Harry appear, carrying a trunk. They put it down.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Oliver: Quidditch is easy enough to understand. Each time has seven players, 3 chasers, 2 beaters, 1 keeper and a seeker that's you. There are three kinds of balls. {picks up a red one} This one's called the Quaffle. Now, the chasers handle the Quaffle and try to put it through one of those three hoops. {Points to a faraway Quidditch pitch.} The keeper, that's me, defends the hoops. {throws ball to Harry.} With me so far?<br/><br/>Harry: {throws back} I think so. What are those? {points to two squirming chained down balls.}<br/><br/>Oliver: ...You better take this. {hands Harry a small bat. He bends down and releases one ball. With an angry growl, it flies off into the air. The two boys watch it.} Careful now, it's comin' back. {The balls comes whizzing down, and Harry cracks at it with the bat. The ball soars off through a statue.} Eh, not bad, Potter, you'd make a fair beater...Uh-oh. {The ball zooms down, and Oliver grabs it, wriggling to get it back in the box. He succeeds and is out of breath.} Bludger. Nasty little buggers. But the only ball I want you to worry about is this...the Golden Snitch. {hands Harry a walnut sized golden ball.}<br/><br/>Harry: I like this ball.<br/><br/>Oliver: Ah, you like it now. Just wait. It's wicked fast and damn near impossible to see.<br/><br/>Harry: What do I do with it?<br/><br/>Oliver: You catch it...before the other team's seeker. You catch this, the game is over. You catch this, Potter, and we win.<br/><br/>{The ball flutters out two delicate wings and jumps into the air. Harry keeps an eye on it.}<br/><br/>Harry: Whoa.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene: PROFESSOR FLITWICK's class. The teacher is very short, and is standing on a bunch of books.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Flitwick: One of a wizard's most rudimentary skills is levitation the ability to make objects fly. Uh, do you all have your feathers? {Hermione raises hers.} Good. Now, uh, don't forget the nice wrist movement we've been practicing, hmm? The swish and flick. Everyone. {All} The swish and flick. Good. And enunciate. Wingardium Leviosa. Off you go then.<br/><br/>Draco: Wingardium Levio-saaa.<br/><br/>{All practice.}<br/><br/>Ron: Wingardrium Leviosar. {whacks with wand numerous times.}<br/><br/>Hermione: Stop, stop, stop. You're going to take someone's eye out. Besides, youre saying it wrong. It's Leviosa, not Leviosar.<br/><br/>Ron: You do it then if you're so clever. Go on, go on.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hermione straightens up and swishes her wand.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hermione: {crisply} Wingardium Leviosa. {The feather glows and lifts up. Ron puts his head on his books dejectedly.}<br/><br/>Flitwick: Oh, well done! See here, everyone! Ms. Granger's done it! Oh, splendid!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Seamus begins swishing at his feather.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Seamus: Wingard Levosa. Wingard Levosa. {Flitwick to Hermione: Well done, dear.}<br/><br/> <br/><br/>BOOOM!!! Seamus' feather explodes. Flitwick gasps.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Flitwick: Whooaaa! Ooh.<br/><br/>Harry: I think we're going to need another feather over here, Professor.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene: Neville, Harry, Ron and Seamus are walking through a courtyard with other students all around.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Ron: It's Leviosa, not Leviosar. Honestly, she's a nightmare. No wonder she hasn't got any friends!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hermione bustles past, sniffling.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry: I think she heard you.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene: Night, in the great hall. It is Halloween. Everyone is eating candy, and Jack O'Lanterns are keeping the place lit. There is chatter.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry: Where's Hermione?<br/><br/>Neville: Parvati Patil said that she wouldn't come out of the girl's bathroom. She said that she'd been in there all afternoon...crying.<br/><br/>{Ron and Harry exchange glances. Suddenly, Professor Quirrell comes flying into the room, screaming.}<br/><br/>Quirrell: TROLL! IN THE DUNGEON! T-TROOLLL IN THE DUNGEON!! {stops and there is utter silence.} Thought you ought to know. {falls over in a dead faint.}<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The room is silent, and then everyone freaks, screaming and running.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Dumbledore: SILLLLLEEENNNNCEEEEE! {Everyone stops.} Everyone will please, not panic. Now, Prefects will lead their houses back to the dormitories. Teachers will follow me to the dungeons.<br/><br/>Girl: Hufflepuff, this way!<br/><br/>Boy: Stay together!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Snape looks aghast, and he disappears through a doorway.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene: Percy is leading the house down a hall.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Percy: Gryffindors...keep up please. And stay alert!<br/><br/>Harry: How could a troll get in?<br/><br/>Ron: Not by itself. Trolls are really stupid. Probably people playing jokes. {Suddenly, Harry stops and pulls Ron aside.} What?<br/><br/>Harry: Hermione! She doesn't know!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The two run off, down corridors. They start running down a hall when they stop, because there is a grunting noise. Harry pulls Ron into a doorway and a large, ugly TROLL thunks by into a room.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry: He's going into the Girl's Bathroom!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene: In the bathroom, Hermione emerges from a stall, wiping her eyes. She stops when she sees something. The troll is standing there. Hermione backs up, into the stall just as the troll raises its club and smashes the top part of the stalls. Hermione screams. Harry and Ron come bursting in.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry: Hermione, move!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The troll smashes the remaining stalls.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hermione: Help! Help! {The boys start throwing wood pieces at the troll.}<br/><br/>Ron: Hey, pea brain! {Ron throws wood and hits the troll on the head. Hermione escapes from the stalls to under a sink, but the troll sees her and goes to smash her. It cracks the sink and barely misses Hermione. Harry cringes.}<br/><br/>Hermione: Ahhh! Help!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry gets out his wand. He runs forward and grabs the troll's club, and is lifted up.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry: Whooa! Whoa, whoa! {He lands on the troll's head, and is hurled forward, then back, and his wand goes up the troll's nose.}<br/><br/>Ron: Ew.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The troll snorts, and whips around.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry: Whoa, whoa whoa!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The troll gets Harry off its head and is holding him by one leg, upside down. It gears up its club and swipes at Harry. He pulls himself up, then down. The troll swipes again.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry: Do something! {swipe}<br/><br/>Ron: What? {swipe}<br/><br/>Harry: Anything! Hurry up!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Ron grabs his wand. Under the sink, Hermione waves her hand.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hermione: Swish and flick!<br/><br/>Ron: Wingardium Leviosa! {flick. The club is lifted out of the troll's hand and hovers above its head. The troll looks up, confused, just as the club comes crashing back down. (Ron: Cool.)  It hits the troll's head and the troll wavers, then drops Harry, who crawls away, and comes crashing down, hard.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hermione approaches carefully.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hermione: Is it...dead?<br/><br/>Harry: I don't think so. Just knocked out. {He grabs his wand...which is covered in goo.} Ew. Troll bogies.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Suddenly, McGonagall, Snape and Quirrell come rushing in.<br/><br/>They all gasp.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>McGonagall: Oh! Oh, my goodness! E-Explain yourselves, both of you!<br/><br/>Ron and Harry: Well, what it is...<br/><br/>Hermione: It's my fault, Professor McGonagall. {The teachers, and Ron and Harry, gape}<br/><br/>McGonagall: Ms. Granger?<br/><br/>Hermione: I went looking for the troll. I'd read about them and thought I could handle it. But I was wrong. If Harry and Ron hadn't come and found me...I'd probably be dead.<br/><br/>McGonagall: Be that as it may...it was an extremely foolish thing to do. {Harry looks at Snape's leg...which has a large cut on it. Snape notices and covers it up, glaring at Harry.} I would have expected more rational behaviour on your part, Ms. Granger. 5 points will be taken from Gryffindor for your serious lack of judgment. As for you two gentlemen I just hope you realize how fortunate you are. Not many students could take on a full grown mountain troll and live to tell the tale. 5 points...will be awarded to each of you. For sheer dumb luck. {Snape and McGonagall exit.}<br/><br/>Quirrell: Perhaps you ought to go...M-might wake up...heh. {Exit Ron and Harry and Hermione.} {Troll roars.} Ahh! Hehe....<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene: The next morning, in the great hall. The gang is sitting, eating. Harry is twirling his food on a fork.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Ron: Take a bit of toast, mate, go on.<br/><br/>Hermione: Ron's right, Harry. You're gonna need your strength today.<br/><br/>Harry: I'm not hungry.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Snape appears.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Snape: Good luck today, Potter. Then again, now that you've proven yourself against a troll, a little game of Quidditch should be easy work for you...even if it is against Slytherin. {Leaves, limping.}<br/><br/>Harry: That explains the blood.<br/><br/>Hermione: Blood?<br/><br/>Harry: Listen, last night, I'm guessing Snape let the troll in as a diversion so he could try and get past that 3 headed dog. But, he got himself bitten, that's why he's limping.<br/><br/>Hermione: But why would anyone go near that dog?<br/><br/>Harry: The day I was at Gringotts, Hagrid took something out of one of the vaults. He said it was Hogwarts' business, very secret.<br/><br/>Hermione: So you're saying...<br/><br/>Harry: That's what the dog's guarding. That's what Snape wants.<br/><br/>{An owl screeches. It is Hedwig. She is carrying a very large, long parcel. She drops it off.}<br/><br/>Hermione: Bit early for mail, isn't it?<br/><br/>Harry: But I-I never get mail.<br/><br/>Ron: Let's open it.<br/><br/>{They open it.}<br/><br/>Harry: It's a broomstick!<br/>Ron: Thats not just any broomstick, Harry. It's a Nimbus 2000!<br/><br/>Harry: But who...?<br/><br/>{He sees Professor McGonagall up at the head table, stroking Hedwig. She smiles and Harry nods.}<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene: Inside a Quidditch tower. The Gryffindor team is marching towards the starting gate. They reach it and stop, behind a closed double door.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>OIiver: Scared, Harry?<br/><br/>Harry: A little bit.<br/><br/>Oliver: That's all right. I felt the same way before my first game.<br/><br/>Harry: What happened?<br/>Oliver: Er, I don't really remember. I took a bludger to the head 2 minutes in. Woke up in the hospital a week later.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry gulps and looks straight ahead as the doors open. They mount their brooms and zoom out onto the enormous pitch. There is cheering. The commentator, LEE JORDAN, is talking from a tower.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Lee: Hello, and welcome to Hogwarts' first Quidditch game of the season! Today's game Slytherin versus Gryffindor!!!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>{Cheering. Close-up of Gryffindor students. They are cheering. Neville: Gryffindor!}<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The players take their positions in the air in a circle. Harry weaves in, highest amongst. He looks down.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Lee: The players take their positions as Madam Hooch steps out onto the field to begin the game.<br/><br/>Hooch: Now, I want a nice clean game...from all of you. {looks at Slytherin. She kicks the trunk, and the bludgers zoom out.}<br/><br/>Lee: The bludgers are up...followed by the Golden Snitch. Remember, the snitch is worth 150 points. The seeker who catches the Snitch ends the game.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The snitch zooms around each Seeker's head, then disappears. Hooch grabs the Quaffle.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Lee: The Quaffle is released...and the game begins!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Gryffindor takes possession of the ball and a chaser, ANGELINA JOHNSON, zooms past Slytherins towards their goal, and throws the ball, and scores! There is a ding.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Lee: Angelina Johnson scores! 10 points for Gryffindor! {He presses a button and a 10 shows up beside a plaque with Gryffindors name.}<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry, in the air, claps.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry: Yes! {a bludger zooms by him.} Whoa!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>In the stands, Gryffindor cheers.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hagrid: Well done!<br/><br/>Lee: Slytherin takes possession of the Quaffle. Bletchley passes to Captain Marcus Flint.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Flint dodges people and throws for the Gryffindor hoops. Oliver appears and whacks the ball away with his broom. He smirks at Flint, who glares. Johnson and KATIE BELL pass the Quaffle back and forth as they strategize to score. Johnson takes it, throws, and once again scores!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Ron and Seamus: Yay!<br/><br/>Harry: Yes!<br/><br/>Lee: Another 10 points to Gryffindor! {ding.}<br/><br/>Gryffindors: Yay!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The Slytherins decide to get messy. They dodge, kick, and try to score. Once again, Oliver blocks.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Flint: Give me that! {he grabs a beaters bat from one and whacks a bludger right at Oliver. It hits Oliver in the stomach and he falls to the ground.}<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Crowd: {Booing}<br/><br/>Harry is visibly upset.<br/><br/>Slytherin laughs.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The Slytherin members head off. One jumps over George (or Fred) and scores. Harry is upset again. Slytherin cheers.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Flint: {to other members} Take that side!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>They box Johnson in and sent her into the capes covering one of the towers. She falls down in and is out. The crowd boos. Slytherin scores once again. Suddenly, Harry sees the Snitch. He starts to head off after it and then his broom starts bucking and turning.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry: Whoa! Whooa!<br/><br/>Hagrid: What's going on with Harry's broomstick?<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hermione looks through binoculars at Harry, then at Snape, who is muttering something.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hermione: It's Snape! He's jinxing the broom!<br/><br/>Ron: Jinxing the broom? What do we do?<br/><br/>Hermione: Leave it to me. {She hands Ron her binoculars and leaves.}<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry is knocked around, then falls, dangling by one arm from the broom.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Ron: Come on, Hermione!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hermione is hurrying up a tower. She appears underneath Snape and touches his cloak with her wand.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hermione: Lacarnum Inflamarae.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>A spark ignites and Snape's cloak catches fire. Hermione leaves.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Man: Fire! You're on fire!<br/><br/>Snape: What? Oh! {knocks the man back, who falls into Quirrell, who then also falls. Snape bats out the fire and acts as though nothing happened. The broom stop bucking, and Harry climbs back on. The Slytherin seeker is after the Snitch. Harry takes off.}<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Ron: Go!<br/><br/>Hagrid: Go go go!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry rams the Slytherin Seeker, then is butted out. He returns, smashing the Seeker again as the Snitch dives. The boys follow, but they approach the ground quickly. The Slytherin Seeker backs out, and Harry pulls up his broom as he follows the Snitch, feet above the ground. Harry stands up, and steps forward, trying to grab the ball. He goes too far, and topples off the broom with a yelp, tumbling on the ground. He gets up and lurches.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The crowd gasps. Hermione appears beside a tower to see.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hagrid: Looks like he's gonna be sick!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry lurches and the Snitch pops out of his mouth. It lands in his hands.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Lee: He's got the Snitch! Harry Potter receives 150 points for catching the Snitch!<br/><br/>Hooch: {Blows whistle} Gryffindor win!<br/><br/>All: YAY!<br/><br/>Draco: No!<br/><br/>Hagrid: Yes!<br/><br/>Hermione: Whoo-hoo!<br/><br/>McGonagall: {Giggles happily}<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry raises the Snitch into the air and the crowd, and his team, cheers.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Crowd: Go go Gryffindor! Go go Gryffindor! Go go Gryffindor! Go go Gryffindor!<br/><br/> <br/><br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene:<br/>Harry, Hermione and Ron are walking along a path with Hagrid, talking.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hagrid: Nonsense. Why would Snape put a curse on Harry's broom?<br/><br/>Harry: Who knows. Why was he trying to get past that 3 headed dog on Halloween?<br/><br/>Hagrid: Who told you 'bout Fluffy?<br/><br/>Ron: Fluffy?<br/>Hermione: That thing has a name?<br/><br/>Hagrid: Well, of course he's got a name. He's mine. I bought him off an Irish feller I met down at the pub last year. Then I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the<br/><br/>Harry: Yes?<br/><br/>Hagrid: Shouldn'ta said that. Don't ask any more questions. That's top secret, that is.<br/><br/>Harry: But Hagrid, whatever Fluffy's guarding, Snape's trying to steal it!<br/><br/>Hagrid: Codswallop. Professor Snape is a Hogwarts teacher.<br/><br/>Hermione: Hogwarts teacher or not, I know a curse when I see one. I've read all about them. You have to keep eye contact. And Snape wasn't blinking.<br/><br/>Harry: Exactly.<br/><br/>Hagrid: {sighs} Now, you listen to me, all three of you. You're meddlin' in things that ought not to be meddled in. It's dangerous. What that dog is guarding is strictly between Professor Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel.<br/><br/>Harry: Nicholas Flamel?<br/><br/>Hagrid: I shouldn't have said that. I should not have said that. I should not have said that. {Exit.}<br/><br/>Harry: Nicholas Flamel...Who's Nicholas Flamel?<br/><br/>Hermione: I don't know.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene: Christmas. The camera pans up to a snowy castle, then to Hagrid, who is bringing in a large tree. Inside the great hall, students are leaving and ghosts are singing (Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas, ring the Hogwarts bell. Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas...) Hermione approaches the empty tables, wheeling a cart. She goes to Ron and Harry, who are playing chess.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry: Knight to E-5.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>A piece moves across the board.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Ron thinks for a moment.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Ron: Queen to E-5.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>A queen walks over to E-5 and clinks the knight away.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hermione: That's totally barbaric!<br/><br/>Ron: That's wizard's chess. I see you've packed.<br/><br/>Hermione: See you haven't.<br/><br/>Ron: Change of plans. My parents decided to go to Romania to visit my brother, Charlie. He's studying dragons there!<br/><br/>Hermione: Good. You can help Harry, then. He's going to go the library for information on Nicholas Flamel.<br/><br/>Ron: We've looked a hundred times!<br/><br/>Hermione: Not in the restricted section...Happy Christmas. {exits.}<br/><br/>Ron: I think we've had a bad influence on her.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene:<br/><br/>X-mas morning. Hedwig is perched in the boys' room, and Harry is asleep in bed.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Ron: {calling from downstairs} Harry, wake up! Come on Harry, wake up!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry gets up and runs to a balcony overlooking the common room, where Ron is standing next to a tree. He is wearing a sweater with an R on it.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Ron: Happy Christmas, Harry.<br/><br/>Harry: Happy Christmas, Ron. What are you wearing?<br/><br/>Ron: Oh, Mum made it for me. Looks like you've got one too!<br/><br/>Harry: I've got presents?<br/><br/>Ron: Yeah!<br/><br/>Harry: Oh! {Harry runs down the stairs.}<br/><br/>Ron: There they are. {Ron sits on a couch arm and eats jelly beans as Harry picks up a silver wrapped package. Harry takes out the card.}<br/><br/>Harry: \"Your father left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was returned to you. Use it well.\"<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry opens the present. It is a cloak.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Ron: What is it?<br/><br/>Harry: Some kind of...cloak.<br/><br/>Ron: Well, let's see then. Put it on.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry puts the cloak on, and all of him disappears except for his head.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Ron: Whoa!<br/><br/>Harry: My body's gone!<br/><br/>Ron: I know what that is! That's an invisibility cloak!<br/><br/>Harry: I'm invisible??<br/><br/>Ron: {gets up} They're really rare. I wonder who gave it to you.<br/><br/>Harry: {comes over} There was no name. It just said, \"Use it well.\"<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene:<br/><br/>Late at night. A lantern and hand appear, but nothing else. The ensemble walk through the dark library and into the Restricted Section. The lamp is put down, and the cloak removed. Harry appears.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry: {Reading books} Famous fire eaters...15th Century Fiends...Flamel...Nicholas Flamel...where are you?<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry picks up a book and opens it. A man's face appears.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Man: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry slams the book shuts and puts it back.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Filchs voice: Who's there?! {Harry whips around, grabbing his cloak. The lamp falls and shatters.} I know you're in there. You can't hide. {Harry puts on his cloak and creeps around Filch.} Who is it? Show yourself!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry runs from the room, breathing heavily. He gets into the hall, where Mrs. Norris is. The cat meows and begins to follow him. Harry runs around a corner, just as Snape and Quirrell appear. Snape pushes Quirrell into the wall.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Quirrell: Severus...I-I thought...<br/><br/>Snape: You don't want me as your enemy, Quirrell.<br/><br/>Quirrell: W-what do you m-mean?<br/><br/>Snape: You know perfectly well what I mean. {Snape senses something. Harry stops breathing. Snape reaches out to grab something, but doesn't. He whips his finger back in front of Quirrell's face.} We'll have another chat soon...when you've had time to decide where your loyalties lie.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Filch appears, carrying the broken lamp.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Filch: Oh, Professors. I found this, in the Restricted Section. It's still hot. That means there's a student out of bed.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>They all dart off. A door opens, and closes. On the other side, there is a vast, empty room that has a large mirror in the center. Harry appears and walks over to the mirror. In it, he sees two people appear.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry: Mum? {the woman nods and smiles} Dad? {nods and smiles. Harry reaches out to touch them, but only gets the mirror. Then, his mother puts her hand on his shoulder. He puts his own hand on his own shoulders, as if trying to feel her there.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene:<br/><br/>The boys' room. Harry comes whipping in, invisible.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry: Ron! You've really got to see this! Ron! You've got to see this! {pulls back covers. Ron wakes up.} Ron, Ron, come on. Get out of bed!<br/><br/>Ron: Why?<br/><br/>Harry: There's something you've got to see. Now, come on!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene:<br/><br/>Back in the mirror room. Harry and Ron appear as if magically and Harry runs to the mirror.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry: Come on. Come. Come look, it's my parents!<br/><br/>Ron: I only see me.<br/><br/>Harry: {moves over} Look in properly. Go on. Stand there. There. You see them, don't you? Thats my dad<br/><br/>Ron: That's me! Only, I'm head boy...and I'm holding the Quidditch cup! And bloody hell, I'm Quidditch Captain too! I look good. Harry, do you think this mirror shows the future?<br/><br/>Harry: How can it? Both my parents are dead. {Harry smiles sadly.}<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene:<br/><br/>Another night. Harry is sitting in front of the mirror. Dumbledore appears behind him.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Dumbledore: Back again, Harry? {Harry turns around and stands up.} I see that you, like so many before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised. I trust by now you realize what it does. Let me give you a clue. The happiest man on earth would look into the mirror and see only himself, exactly as he is.<br/><br/>Harry: So, then it shows us what we want? Whatever we want?<br/><br/>Dumbledore: Yes...and no. It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desires of our hearts. Now you, who have never known your family, you see them standing beside you. But remember this, Harry. This mirror gives us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away in front of it, even gone mad. That is why tomorrow it will be moved to a new home, and I must ask you not to go looking for it again. It does not do to dwell on dreams, Harry, and forget to live. {Harry looks back at the mirror.}<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene:<br/><br/>Daytime. It is all snowy. Harry is out in a main courtyard, bundled up, with Hedwig on his arm. He stops and she lifts off, soaring away into the sky. When she returns, it is spring time.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene:<br/><br/>In the library. Harry and Ron are seated, reading. Hermione comes up with a huge book. She thumps it onto the table. Harry jumps.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hermione: I had you looking in the wrong section! How could I be so stupid? I checked this out a few weeks ago for a bit of light reading.<br/><br/>Ron: This is light?<br/><br/>Hermione: {glares} Of course! Here it is! \"Nicholas Flamel is the only known maker of the Philosopher's Stone!\"<br/><br/>Ron and Harry: The what?<br/><br/>Hermione: Honestly, don't you two read? \"The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary substance with astonishing powers. It will turn any metal into pure gold and produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal.\"<br/><br/>Ron: Immortal?<br/><br/>Hermione: It means you'll never die.<br/><br/>Ron: I know what it means!<br/><br/>Harry: Shh!<br/><br/>Hermione: \"The only stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel, the noted alchemist, who last year celebrated his 665th birthday!\" That's what Fluffy's guarding on the 3rd floor. That's what's under the trapdoor...the Philosopher's Stone!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>They all look at each other.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene:<br/><br/>Nighttime. Hermione, Ron and Harry are running across the wet ground to Hagrids hut. They knock on the door and it opens.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry: Hagrid!<br/><br/>Hagrid: {clad in oven mitts and an apron} Oh, hello. Sorry, don't wish to be rude, but I'm in no fit state to entertain today. {Closes door.}<br/><br/>All 3: We know about the Philosopher's Stone!<br/><br/>{Door reopens.}<br/><br/>Hagrid: Oh.<br/><br/>{They all come into Hagrid's small hut.}<br/><br/>Harry: We think Snape's trying to steal it.<br/><br/>Hagrid: Snape? Blimey, Harry, you're not still on about him, are you?<br/><br/>Harry: Hagrid, we know he's after the Stone. We just don't know why.<br/><br/>Hagrid: Snape is one of the teachers protecting the Stone! He's not about to steal it!<br/><br/>Harry: What?<br/><br/>Hagrid: You heard. Right. Come on, now, I'm a bit preoccupied today.<br/><br/>Harry: Wait a minute. {Ron and a big black boarhound, FANG, meet. Fang sniffs Ron.} One of the teachers?<br/>Hermione: {sitting in a large chair} Of course! There are other things defending the Stone, aren't there? Spells, enchantments.<br/><br/>Hagrid: That's right. Waste of bloody time, if you ask me.<br/><br/>{Hermione looks at Ron, who is being sniffed in the face by Fang. Ron shuffles away.} Ain't no one gonna get past Fluffy. Hehe, not a soul knows how. Except for me and Dumbledore. I shouldn't have told you that. I shouldn't have told you that. {A cauldron over a fire begins to rattle.} Oh! {Hagrid hurries over and grabs something} Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! {puts the thing, an egg, on the table. The group crowds around.}<br/><br/>Harry: Uh, Hagrid, what exactly is that?<br/><br/>Hagrid: That? It's a ... its um...<br/><br/>Ron: I know what that is! But Hagrid, how did you get one?<br/><br/>Hagrid: I won it. Off a stranger I met down at a pub. Seemed quite glad to be rid off it, as a matter of fact.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The egg rattles and cracks. Pieces fly off as a dragon emerges. It squeaks and slips on an egg piece.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hermione: Is that...a dragon?<br/><br/>Ron: That's not just a dragon. That's a Norwegian Ridgeback! My brother Charlie works with these in Romania.<br/><br/>Hagrid: Isn't he beautiful? Oh. Bless him, look. He knows his mummy. Hehe. Hallo, Norbert. {The dragon squeaks as it looks at Hagrid.}<br/><br/>Harry: Norbert?<br/><br/>Hagrid: Yeah, well, he's got to have a name, doesn't he?<br/><br/>Ron: {laughs}<br/><br/>Hagrid: Don't you, Norbert? {raises fingers back and forth across Norberts chin} Dededede.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Norbert backs away, hiccups and blows a fireball of fire into Hagrid's beard.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hagrid: Ohh! Oooh, ooh, ooh, well...he'll have to be trained up a bit, of course. {Norbert hiccups. Hagrid sees someone looking in the window.} Who's that? {The person scampers away.}<br/><br/>Harry: Malfoy.<br/><br/>Hagrid: Oh, dear.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene:<br/><br/>The three are walking back through a corridor. An owl screeches.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry: Hagrid always wanted a dragon. He told me so the first time I met him.<br/><br/>Ron: It's crazy. And worse, Malfoy knows.<br/><br/>Harry: I don't understand. Is that bad?<br/><br/>Ron: It's bad.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>They stop as McGonagall, in her nightgown, appears.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>McGonagall: Good evening.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Malfoy appears smugly beside her.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene:<br/><br/>McGonagall's classroom. The three accused are standing in front of McGonagall's desk, while Malfoy is feet away, smirking.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>McGonagall: Nothing, I repeat, nothing gives a student the right to walk about the school at night. Therefore, as punishment for your actions, 50 points will be taken.<br/><br/>Harry: 50?!<br/><br/>McGonagall: Each. And to ensure it doesn't happen again, all four of you will receive detention.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Malfoy nods, then his smile vanishes.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Draco: Excuse me, Professor. Perhaps I heard you wrong. I thought you said...\"the four of us.\"<br/><br/> <br/><br/>McGonagall: No, you heard me correctly, Mr. Malfoy. You see, as honorable as your intentions were, you too were out of bed after hours. You will serve detention with your classmates.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry, Ron and Hermione grin, and Draco sags.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene:<br/><br/>Outside, at night, the four students are being led to Hagrid's hut by Mr. Filch.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Filch: A pity they let the old punishments die. There was a time detention would find you hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons. God, I miss the screaming. {Draco gulps, and Hermione rushes by.} You'll be serving detention with Hagrid tonight. He's got a little job to do inside the dark forest. {Hagrid appears with a crossbow. He sniffles.} A sorry lot this, Hagrid. Oh, good God, man, you're not still on about that bloody dragon, are you?<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hagrid: {sniffs and sighs} Norbert's gone. Dumbledore sent him off to Romania to live in a colony.<br/><br/>Hermione: Well, that's good, isn't it? He'll be with his own kind.<br/><br/>Hagrid: Yeah, but what if he don't like Romania? {Filch rolls eyes.} What if the other dragons are mean to him? He's only a baby, after all.<br/><br/>Filch: Oh, for Gods sake, pull yourself together, man. You're going into the forest, after all. Got to have your wits about you.<br/><br/>Draco: The forest? I thought that was a joke! We can't go in there. Students aren't allowed. And there are...{a howl sounds}...werewolves!<br/><br/>Filch: There's more than werewolves in those trees, lad. You can be sure of that. {Draco looks frightened.} Nighty-night. {Exit.}<br/><br/>Hagrid: Right. Let's go.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene: In the forest. The group walks along a path to a tree. Hagrid stops, bends down and dips his fingers in a silver puddle. He pulls out his fingers and rubs them together. A silver trail smears with his fingers.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry: Hagrid, what's that?<br/><br/>Hagrid: What we're here for. See that? That's unicorn's blood, that is. I found one dead a few weeks ago. Now, this one's been injured bad by something. {Harry suddenly sees a large cloaked figure walking through the trees. He looks at Hagrid.} So, it's our job to find the poor beast. Ron, Hermione, you'll come with me.<br/><br/>Ron: {weakly} Okay.<br/><br/>Hagrid: And Harry, you'll go with Malfoy. {Draco grimaces, and Harry nods.}<br/><br/>Draco: Okay. Then I get Fang!<br/><br/>Hagrid: Fine. Just so you know, he's a bloody coward. {Fang whines.}<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene:<br/><br/>Harry and Draco are walking through the forest, Fang leading. Draco has the lamp.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Draco: You wait till my father hears about this. This is servant's stuff.<br/><br/>Harry: If I didn't know better, Draco, I'd say you were scared.<br/><br/>Draco: Scared, Potter?! {Scoffs} {howl} Did you hear that? Come on, Fang. Scared.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene:<br/><br/>The group approaches a flat ground with gnarled roots all over. Fang stops, then growls.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry: What is it, Fang?<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Up ahead, a cloaked figure is crouched over a dead unicorn, drinking its blood. The figure raises its head, silver blood dripping from its mouth.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry gasps and grabs his scar, which is hurting.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Draco: {A look of pure fear} AHHHHHHHHH!!! AHHH! {runs away, with Fang} HELP!!!!!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry is left by himself. The figure slides over the unicorn and rises erect. It advances towards Harry, who backs up, but trips. He crawls backwards. Suddenly, there is the sound of hoofbeats. A figure leaps over Harry and lands near the cloaked figure. It is a silver centaur, FIRENZE. It rears, and the cloaked figure retreats, flying away.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Firenze: Harry Potter, you must leave. You are known to many creatures here. The forest is not safe at this time. Especially for you.<br/><br/>Harry: {rises} But what was that thing you saved me from?<br/><br/>Firenze: A monstrous creature. It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn. Drinking the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death. But at a terrible price. You have slain something so pure that the moment the blood touches your lips, you will have a half-life. A cursed life.<br/><br/>Harry: But who would choose such a life?<br/><br/>Firenze: Can you think of no one?<br/><br/>Harry: Do you mean to say...that that thing that killed the unicorn...that was drinking its blood...that was Voldemort?<br/><br/>Firenze: Do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?<br/><br/>Harry: The Philosopher's Stone.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Suddenly, a dog (Fang) barks. Harry looks up and sees Hagrid, Hermione, Ron and Draco appear.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hermione: Harry!<br/><br/>Hagrid: Hello there, Firenze. I see you've met our young Mr. Potter. You all right there, Harry? {Harry nods}<br/><br/>Firenze: Harry Potter, this is where I leave you. You're safe now. Good luck.<br/> <br/>{Close up on the dead unicorn.}<br/><br/> <br/>Scene:<br/><br/>Gryffindor common room. Right after 'attack.' The group is around the fire. Hermione and Ron are seated, but Harry stands.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hermione: You mean, You-Know-Who's out there, right now, in the forest?<br/><br/>Harry: But he's weak. He's living off the unicorns. Don't you see? We had it wrong. Snape doesn't want the stone for himself, he wants the stone for Voldemort. With the Elixir of Life, Voldemort will be strong again. He'll He'll come back. {Sits down.}<br/><br/>Ron: But if he comes back, you don't think he'll try to kill you, do you?<br/><br/>Harry: I think if he'd had the chance, he might have tried to kill me tonight.<br/><br/>Ron: {Gulp} And to think, I've been worrying about my Potions final!<br/><br/>Hermione: Hang on a minute. We're forgetting one thing. Who's the one wizard Voldemort always feared?<br/><br/>{The boys shrug.} Dumbledore! As long as Dumbledore's around, you're safe. As long as Dumbledore's around, you can't be touched. {Harry smiles slightly.}<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene:<br/><br/>Some time later. In the outdoor courtyard. The three are walking.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hermione: I've always heard Hogwarts' end of the year exams were frightful, but I found that rather enjoyable.<br/><br/>Ron: Speak for yourself. All right there, Harry?<br/><br/>Harry: My scar. It keeps burning.<br/><br/>Hermione: It's happened before.<br/><br/>Harry: Not like this.<br/><br/>Ron: Perhaps you should see the nurse.<br/><br/>Harry: I think it's a warning. It means dangers coming. Uhh! {He rubs scar and then sees Hagrid across the field, at his hut.} Oh. Of course! {runs for hut.}<br/><br/>Hermione: What is it?<br/><br/>Harry: Don't you think it's a bit odd that what Hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon, and a stranger shows up and just happens to have one? {They approach Hagrid, who is playing the Harry Potter theme on his flute.} I mean, how many people wander around with dragon eggs in their pockets? Why didn't I see it before? Hagrid, who gave you the dragon egg? {Hagrid stops playing.} What did he look like?<br/><br/>Hagrid: I don't know. I never saw his face. He kept his hood up.<br/><br/>Harry: The stranger, though, you and he must have talked.<br/><br/>Hagrid: Well, he wanted to know what sort of creatures I looked after. I told him. I said, \"After Fluffy, a dragon's gonna be no problem.\"<br/><br/>Harry: And did he seem interested in Fluffy?<br/><br/>Hagrid: Well, of course he was interested in Fluffy! How often do you come across a three headed dog, even if you're in the trade? But I told him. I said, \"The trick with any beast is to know how to calm him. Take Fluffy, for example, just play him a bit of music and he falls straight to sleep.\"<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The three gape.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hagrid: I shouldn't have told you that. {The three take off.} Where you going?! Wait!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene:<br/><br/>McGonagall's classroom. The three come tearing in and run up the aisles between desks. They pass a ghost and stop at the desk.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry: We have to see Professor Dumbledore, immediately!<br/><br/>McGonagall: I'm afraid Professor Dumbledore is not here. He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and left immediately for London.<br/><br/>Harry: He's gone?! Now? But this is important! It's about...the Philosopher's Stone.<br/><br/>McGonagall: {shocked} How do you know<br/><br/>Harry: Someone's going to try and steal it.<br/><br/>McGonagall: I don't know how you three found out about the stone, but I can assure you it is perfectly well-protected. Now would you go back to your dormitories? Quietly. {They leave.}<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene:<br/><br/>After exiting McGonagall's class, they walk down the hallway.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry: That was no stranger Hagrid met in the village. It was Snape, which means he knows how to get past Fluffy.<br/><br/>Hermione: And with Dumbledore gone<br/><br/>{Snape suddenly appears behind them}<br/><br/>Snape: Good afternoon. Now, what would three young Gryffindors such as yourselves be doing inside on a day like this?<br/><br/>Hermione: Uh...we were just...<br/><br/>Snape: You want to be careful. People will think you're {Harry glares madly at Snape, who looks shocked} up to something. {Exit.}<br/><br/>Hermione: Now what do we do?<br/><br/>Harry: We go down the trapdoor. Tonight.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene: Nighttime. In the Gryffindor Common Room. The three friends come down the stairs and begin to walk across the floor. They stop when they hear croaking.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry: Trevor.<br/><br/>Ron: Trevor shh! Go, you shouldn't be here!<br/><br/>Neville: {appears behind a chair} Neither should you. You're sneaking out again, arent you?<br/><br/>Harry: Now, Neville, listen. We were<br/><br/>Neville: No! I won't let you! {stands} You'll get Gryffindor in trouble again! I-I'll fight you. {holds out fists.}<br/><br/>Hermione: Neville, I'm really, really sorry about this...{takes out wand} Petrificus Totalus.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Neville is frozen and falls backwards onto the ground. Hermione puts her wand back.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Ron: {Gulp} You're a little scary sometimes...you know that? Brilliant, but scary.<br/><br/>Harry: Let's go. {Walks by Neville} Sorry.<br/><br/>Hermione: Sorry.<br/><br/>Ron: It's for your own good, you know. {Exit.}<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene: The three are under the Invisibility cloak, sneaking along the corridor.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hermione: Ow! You stood on my foot!<br/><br/>Ron: Sorry. {A flame lights. Hermione draws out her wand and points it at the door.}<br/><br/>Hermione: Alohomora.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The door opens and they go in.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Ron: Wait a minute...he's....{a blow of air, and the cape flutters off them.} Sleeping.<br/><br/>Harry: Snape's already been here. He's put a spell on the harp. {They approach the sleeping dog.}<br/><br/>Ron: Uh. It's got horrible breath!<br/><br/>Harry: We have to move its paw.<br/><br/>Ron: What?!<br/><br/>Harry: Come on! {grabs paw, which is blocking the door.} Okay. Push! {They strain and move it. They open the door.} I'll go first. Don't follow until I give you a sign. {Fluffy's eyes open.} If something bad happens, get yourselves out...Does it seem a bit...quiet?<br/><br/>Hermione: The harp. It stopped playing.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Drool from one head comes down on Ron's shoulder.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Ron: Ew! Yuck! Ugh. {All three kids look up and see Fluffy standing there. Fluffy barks and growls, thrashing. It breaks the harp and dives at the three.}<br/><br/>Harry: Jump! Go! {They all jump through the trapdoor.}<br/><br/>Ron: Ahh! {gasps as he lands on some mushy black ropelike vines.} Whoa. Lucky this plant-thing is here, really.<br/><br/>Harry: Whoa! {The plant begins to move towards them.} Oh. Ahh! {The plant ties them up.}<br/><br/>Hermione: Stop moving, both of you. This is Devil's Snare. You have to relax. If you don't, it will only kill you faster.<br/><br/>Ron: Kill us faster?! Oh, now I can relax!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hermione manages a smile as she is sucked down below.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Ron and Harry: Hermione!!<br/><br/>Ron: Now what are we gonna do?!<br/><br/>Hermione's voice: Just relax!<br/><br/>Harry: Hermione! Where are you?!<br/><br/>Hermione (from below): Do what I say. Trust me.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry relaxes and is sucked through.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Ron: Ahh! Harry!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry falls through and lands on the hard ground. Hermione goes over to him and he stands up.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Ron: Harry!<br/><br/>Hermione: Are you okay?<br/><br/>Harry: Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.<br/><br/>Ron: Help!<br/><br/>Hermione: He's not relaxing, is he?<br/><br/>Harry: Apparently not.<br/><br/>Ron: Help! Help me!<br/><br/>Hermione: We've got to do something!<br/><br/>Harry: What?<br/><br/>Hermione: Uh! I remember reading something in Herbology. {Ron: Help!} Um Devil's Snare, Devil's Scare, {The snare shuts Ron's mouth} it's deadly fun...but will sulk in the sun! That's it! Devil's Snare hates sunlight! {takes out wand and points upwards.} Lumus Solem! {A beam of light shoots out. The Snare shrieks and recoils. Ron falls below.}<br/><br/>Ron: Ahhh!<br/><br/>Harry: Ron, are you okay?<br/><br/>Ron: Yeah.<br/><br/>Harry: Okay.<br/><br/>Ron: {stands} Whew. Lucky we didn't panic!<br/><br/>Harry: Lucky Hermione pays attention in Herbology.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>There is a sound.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hermione: What is that?<br/><br/>Harry: I don't know. Sounds like wings.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>They enter into a room filled with golden \"birds.\"<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hermione: Curious. I've never seen birds like these.<br/><br/>Harry: They're not birds, they're keys. And I'll bet one of them fits that door. {They come upon a broomstick, suspended in the air.}<br/><br/>Hermione: What's this all about?<br/><br/>Harry: I don't know. Strange.<br/><br/>{Ron creeps over to the door and takes out his wand.}<br/><br/>Ron: {rattles lock.} Alohomora! {Shrugs} Well, it was worth a try.<br/><br/>Hermione: Ugh! What're we going to do? There must be 1000 keys up there!<br/><br/>Ron: We're looking for a big old fashioned one. Probably rusty like the handle.<br/><br/>Harry: There! I see it! {points} The one with the broken wing! {He looks at the broom.}<br/><br/>Hermione: What's wrong, Harry?<br/><br/>Harry: It's too simple.<br/><br/>Ron: Oh, go on, Harry! If Snape can catch it on that old broomstick, you can! You're the youngest seeker in a century!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry nods and grabs the broom. All the keys suddenly go one direction, right at Harry. He climbs on, swiping at them.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Ron: This complicates things a bit!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry pushes off into the air. He flies off, after the key. The others follow him. Harry grabs the key.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry: Catch the key!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>He zooms by and throws the key to Hermione, who catches it and heads for the lock while Harry distracts the other keys. Hermione puts it in the lock.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Ron: Hurry up!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The door opens, and Hermione and Ron rush through, followed by Harry. They shut the door just as the keys slam up against it.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene:<br/><br/>They enter a dark room, with broken pieces all around it.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hermione: I don't like this. I don't like this at all.<br/><br/>Harry: Where are we? A graveyard.<br/><br/>Ron: This is no graveyard. {sighs} It's a chessboard. {Walks out onto the marble board and flames light, illuminating the board and GIANT players. Harry and Hermione come up with him.}<br/><br/>Harry: There's the door.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>They walk across the board, towards the door. Suddenly, as they reach a line of pawns, the pawns bring up their swords. The three jump and back up.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hermione: Now what do we do?<br/><br/>Ron: It's obvious, isn't it? We've got to play our way across the room. All right. Harry, you take the Bishop's square. Hermione, you'll be the Queen's side castle. As for me, I'll be a knight. {They all take their places.}<br/><br/>Hermione: What happens now?<br/><br/>Ron: {aboard a horse.} Well, white moves first, and then...we play. {A pawn on the other side moves forward. Ron studies the game.}<br/><br/>Hermione: Ron, you don't suppose this is going to be like...real wizard's chess, do you?<br/><br/>Ron: You there! D-5! {A black pawn moves forward, diagonal to the white pawn. The white pawn raises its swords and smashes the black one. The three jump.} Yes, Hermione, I think this is going to be exactly like wizard's chess!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The game continues. Pieces smash each other, boom! Boom!<br/><br/>Ron: Castle to E-4! Smash! Ron: Pawn to C-3! Smash! Boom! The Queen turns, and smashes a piece! Harry, Ron and Hermione wince. The Queen turns again. Both Ron and Harry study the game.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry: Wait a minute.<br/><br/>Ron: You understand right, Harry. Once I make my move, the Queen will take me...then you'll be free to check the King.<br/><br/>Harry: No, Ron! No!<br/><br/>Hermione: What is it?<br/><br/>Harry: He's going to sacrifice himself!<br/><br/>Hermione: No, Ron, you can't! {Ron closes his eyes.} There must be another way!<br/><br/>Ron: {turns to face Hermione.} Do you want to stop Snape or not? Harry, it's you that has to go on. I know it. Not me, not Hermione, you. {Harry nods.} Knight...to H-3.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Ron's horse moves forward, slides and stops.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Ron: Check.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The Queen turns and advances. Ron breathes faster, clutching the steel reins. The Queen stops. SMASH! Ron goes flying off the horse and lands on the floor, unconscious.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Ron: Ahhhh!<br/><br/>Harry: RON! {Hermione starts walking to him.} NO! Don't move! Dont forget, we're still playing. {Hermione moves back. Harry walks the diagonal in front of the King.} Checkmate. {The Kings sword falls onto the ground victory. Harry breathes out and then the two run to Ron. They bend beside him.} Take care of Ron. Then, go to the owlery. Send a message to Dumbledore. Ron's right...I have to go on.<br/><br/>Hermione: You'll be okay, Harry. You're a great wizard, you really are.<br/><br/>Harry: Not as good as you.<br/><br/>Hermione: {smile} Me? Books and cleverness? There are more important things. Friendship, and bravery. And Harry, just be careful.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry nods and stands, walking away.<br/><br/> <br/><br/><br/> <br/>Scene:<br/><br/>Harry walks down a long staircase to an empty room with pillars around it. The Mirror of Erised is in the middle of the room, and a man is standing before it. It is Quirrell. Harry yelps and grabs his scar.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry: You? {Quirrell turns around.} No. It can't be...Snape. He was the one<br/><br/>Quirrell: Yes. He does seem the type, doesn't he? Next to me, who would suspect, \"p-p-poor s-stuttering Professor Quirrell?\"<br/><br/>Harry: B-but, that day, during the Quidditch Match, Snape tried to kill me.<br/><br/>Quirrell: No, dear boy. I tried to kill you! And trust me, if Snape's cloak hadn't caught fire and broken my eye contact, I would have succeeded. Even with Snape muttering his little counter-curse.<br/><br/>Harry: Snape was trying to...save me?<br/><br/>Quirrell: I knew you were a danger right from the off. Especially after Halloween.<br/><br/>Harry: Th-then you let the troll in.<br/><br/>Quirrell: Very good Potter, yes. Snape, unfortunately, wasn't fooled. While everyone else was running to the dungeon, he went to the 3rd floor to head me off. He, of course, never trusted me again. He rarely left me alone. {Quirrell turns back to the mirror and Harry's scar hurts.} But he doesn't understand. I'm never alone. Never. Now...what does this mirror do? I see what I desire. I see myself holding the stone. But how do I get it?<br/><br/>{A raspy voice, VOLDEMORT, calls.}: Use the boy.<br/><br/>Quirrell: Come here, Potter, now!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry walks forward shakily.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Quirrell: Tell me. What do you see?<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry looks in the mirror. He sees himself. His mirror self brings his hand into his pocket and takes out a red stone! The mirror self winks and puts the stone back. Very subtly, Harry reaches to his pocket. There is a lump. He gasps.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Quirrell: What is it?! What do you see?!<br/><br/>Harry: I-I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore. I've won the house cup.<br/><br/>Voldemort's voice: He lies.<br/><br/>Quirrell: Tell the truth! What do you see?!<br/><br/>Voldemort's voice: Let me speak to him.<br/><br/>Quirrell: Master, you are not strong enough.<br/><br/>Voldemort's voice: I have strength enough for this. {Quirrell unwraps his turban and on the side opposite his face, another face is planted. It is Voldemort who appears kind of like a snake. He stretches out and faces Harry via the mirror.} Harry Potter. We meet again.<br/><br/>Harry: Voldemort.<br/><br/>Voldemort: Yes. You see what I have become? See what I must do to survive? Live off another. A mere parasite. Unicorn blood can sustain me, but it cannot give me a body of my own. But there is something that can. Something, that conveniently enough, lies in your pocket!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry turns and runs.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Voldemort: Stop him! {Quirrell snaps his fingers and fire erupts all around the room. Harry is stuck.} Don't be a fool! Why suffer a horrific death when you can join me and live?!<br/><br/>Harry: {shakes his head} Never!<br/><br/>Voldemort: Haha. Bravery. Your parents had it too. Tell me, Harry, would you like to see your mother and father again? Together, we can bring them back. {In the mirror, Harrys parents faces appear.} All I ask for is something in return. {Harry takes the stone from his pocket.} That's it, Harry. There is no good and evil. There is only power, and those too weak to seek it. Together, we'll do extraordinary things. Just give me the stone! {Mother and father vanish.}<br/><br/>Harry: You liar!<br/><br/>Voldemort: Kill him!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Quirrell soars into the air and smashes into Harry, one hand on Harrys throat. They fall to the steps. The stone falls out of Harry's reach as Quirrell chokes him. Harry strains and squeaks. Suddenly, Harry puts his hand on Quirrell's, trying to get him off. Smoke furls from under his hand.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Quirrell: Ahh! Ahh! {backs up. His hand is crumbling into a mountain of black ash.} What is this magic? {hand dissipates.}<br/><br/>Voldemort: Fool! Get the stone!<br/><br/>Quirrell: {Walks forward, but Harry puts both hands on his face.} Ahhhhhhhhhh!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Quirrell backs up, then his face, which is horrendously burned, crumbles as he walks forward. His whole body is ash. He falls to the floor. Harry gasps. He looks at his own hands and hurries over to the stone. He picks it up and sighs, when he hears something. Turning, Harry sees a dust clouds with Voldemort's face. The cloud rushes forward, right through Harry!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Voldemort: Arrrhhhhhh!<br/><br/>Harry: Ahhhhhhhhh! {Voldemort flies away. Harry falls to the ground, unconscious. He holds the stone in an outstretched hand.}<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene:<br/><br/>The hospital wing. Harry is bandaged, lying in bed. He awakens, puts on his glasses, and sits up. There are cards and candy all over. Dumbledore approaches him.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Dumbledore: Good afternoon, Harry. Ah. Tokens from your admirers?<br/><br/>Harry: Admirers?<br/><br/>Dumbledore: What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. {Both smile.} Ah, I see your friend Ronald has saved you the trouble of opening your Chocolate Frogs.<br/><br/>Harry: Ron was here? Is he all right? What about Hermione?<br/>Dumbledore: Fine. They're both just fine.<br/><br/>Harry: But, what happened to the Stone?<br/><br/>Dumbledore: Relax, dear boy. The stone has been destroyed. My friend Nicholas and I had a little chat and agreed it was best all around.<br/><br/>Harry: But Flamel, he'll die, won't he?<br/><br/>Dumbledore: {sits on the bed.} He has enough Elixir to set his affairs in order. But yes, he will die.<br/><br/>Harry: How is it I got the Stone, sir? One minute I was staring in the mirror, and the next...<br/><br/>Dumbledore: Ah. You see, only a person who wanted to find the Stone, find it, but not use it, would be able to get it. That is one of my more brilliant ideas. And between you and me thats saying something. {Smile both.}<br/><br/>Harry: Does that mean, with the Stone gone, I mean, that Voldemort can never come back?<br/><br/>Dumbledore: Ah, I'm afraid there are ways in which he can return. Harry, do you know why Professor Quirrell couldn't bear to have you touch him? {Harry shakes his head.} It was because of your mother. She sacrificed herself for you, and that kind of act leaves a mark. {Harry touches his scar.} No, no, this kind of mark cannot be seen. It lives in your very skin.<br/><br/>Harry: What is it?<br/><br/>Dumbledore: Love, Harry, love. {Pats Harry's head and stands up.} Ah. Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans. I was most unfortunate in my youth to come across a vomit flavoured one, and since then I have lost my liking for them. But I think I could be safe with a nice toffee...{takes brown bean and eats it.} Mm. Alas. Earwax.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene:<br/><br/>Harry approaches a room where up on a stairwell balcony Hermione and Ron are talking. They stop when they see Harry and lean over the railing.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry: All right there, Ron?<br/><br/>Ron: All right? You?<br/><br/>Harry: {shrug} All right. Hermione?<br/><br/>Hermione: {smile} Never better.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene:<br/><br/>In the great hall. All students are seated, and green banners with snakes on them are around the ceiling.<br/><br/>Dumbledore, at the head table, nods to McGonagall.<br/><br/>She dings her glass and the chatter stops. Dumbledore rises.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Dumbledore: Another year gone. And now, as I understand it, the house cup needs awarding, and the points stand thus. In fourth place, Gryffindor with 312 points. {Clapping. Harry and Hermione hide their heads.} Third place, Hufflepuff, with 352 points. {Clapping.} In second place, Ravenclaw, with 426 points. {Clapping.} And in first place, with 472 points, Slytherin House.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>There is immense cheering.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Students: Whoo! Yeah!<br/><br/>Draco: Nice one, Mate! {sees Ron looking at him and sneers.}<br/><br/>Dumbledore: Yes, yes, well done Slytherin, well done Slytherin. However, recent events must be taken into account. And I have a few last minute points to award. {The Gryffindor students look up.} To Miss Hermione Granger, for the use of cool intellect when others were in great peril, 50 points. {Applause.}<br/><br/>Harry: {Pats} Good job.<br/><br/>Dumbledore: Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley, for the best played game of chess {Ron looks at Harry and mouths, 'Me?' Harry nods, and mouths, 'You!'} that Hogwarts has seen these many years...50 points. {Applause} And third, to Mr. Harry Potter, for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house 60 points. {Immense cheering.}<br/><br/>Hermione: We're tied with Slytherin!<br/><br/>Dumbledore: And finally, it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to your enemies, but a great deal more to stand up to your friends. I award 10 points to Neville Longbottom.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Immense cheering erupts. Neville is unbelieving, and sits there while cheering gets louder. Draco is downfallen.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Dumbledore: Assuming that my calculations are correct, I believe that a change of direction is in order. {Claps. The green banners change to Gryffindor red and yellow.} Gryffindor wins the House Cup!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Cheering.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hagrid: Yes! {grins}<br/><br/> <br/><br/>All students stand and throw their hats into the air, except Draco, who smashes his down onto the table.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Seamus: Neville! {Shakes his hand.}<br/><br/> <br/><br/>All rub each other's hair and jump around, cheering and laughing.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Lee: Yeah! We won!! {Jumps with Harry, who looks back and grins very widely.}<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Scene:<br/><br/>The outdoor train station. Students are walking around, getting in the train.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hagrid: Come on now, hurry up. You'll be late. Train's leaving. Go on. Go on. Come on. Hurry up.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry hands Hedwig to a train man, and walks to an open door of the train with Hermione. Hermione waves to Hagrid, who waves back. Hermione gets in the train.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hermione: Come on, Harry.<br/><br/>Harry: One minute. {He walks over to Hagrid.}<br/><br/>Hagrid: Thought you were leaving without saying good-bye, didja? {Hagrid takes a red album out of his coat pocket and hands it to Harry.} This is for you.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry opens the album and sees a picture, moving, of him as a baby with his parents. They are all smiling and waving. Harry smiles.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry: Thanks, Hagrid. {Shakes Hagrid's hand, then hugs him tightly.}<br/><br/>Hagrid: Oh. Go on...on with you. {Harry lets go.} Oh, listen, Harry, if that dolt of a cousin of yours, Dudley, gives you any grief, you could always, um, threaten him with a nice pair of ears to go with that tail of his.<br/><br/>Harry: But Hagrid, we're not allowed to do magic away from Hogwarts. You know that.<br/><br/>Hagrid: I do. But your cousin don't, do he? Eh? {chuckle} Off you go.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Harry walks away, back to the train door where Hermione and Ron are waiting.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Hermione: Feels strange to be going home, doesn't it?<br/><br/>Harry: I'm not going home. Not really.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>The train whistles and they climb aboard. As the train starts to leave and the camera pans up over the whole scene, Harry waves out the window to Hagrid, who waves back and then waves more to other students as the camera pans far back, then the credits begin.\n",

       "' Harry Potter and the Sorcerer™s Stone  By J.K. Rowling \\n   CHAPTER ONE \\n  The Boy Who Lived  \\n      Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet\\n Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last\\n people you™d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn™t hold with such nonsense.  \\n      Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm \\ncalled Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy \\nman with hardly any neck, although he did have \\na very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she \\nspent so much of her time craning over garden\\n fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in thei\\nr opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.  \\n      The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was \\nthat somebody would discover it. They didn™t think \\nthey could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley™s sister, but they hadn™t met for several years; in fact, \\nMrs. Dursley pretended she didn™t have a sist\\ner, because her sister and her good-for-nothing \\nhusband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to \\nbe. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters \\narrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping \\n\\nthe Potters away; they didn™t want D\\nudley mixing with a child like that. \\n \\n      When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on th\\ne dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon \\nbe happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he pick\\ned out his most boring tie for \\nwork, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high \\nchair.  \\n      None of them noticed a la\\nrge, tawny owl flutter past the window.  \\n      At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs.\\n Dursley on the cheek, and \\ntried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, becau\\nse Dudley was now having a tantrum and \\nthrowing his cereal at the walls. \\n \\n  ﬁLittle tyke,ﬂ chortled Mr. Dursley as he left \\nthe house. He got into his car and backed out of number four™s drive. \\n \\n      It was on the corner of the street that \\nhe noticed the first sign of something peculiar Š a cat \\nreading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn™t realize what he had seen Š then he jerked his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn™t a map in sight. What could he have b\\neen thinking of? It must have been a trick of \\nthe light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around \\nthe corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was \\nnow reading the sign that said Privet Drive Š no, looking at the sign; cats couldn™t read maps \\nor signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of hi\\ns mind. As he drove toward town he thought of \\n\\nnothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.  \\n      But on the edge of town, drills were driven\\n out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the \\nusual morning traffic jam, he couldn™t help notici\\nng that there seemed to be a lot of strangely \\ndressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr. Durs\\nley couldn™t bear people who dressed in funny clothes Š the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. \\nHe drummed his fingers on the steering wheel an\\nd his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren™t young at all; why, that man had to\\n be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The nerve of him!\\n But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was \\nprobably some silly stunt Šthese people were \\nobviously collecting for something– yes, that \\nwould be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. \\nDursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills. \\n \\n      Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor. If he hadn™t, he might have found it harder to co\\nncentrate on drills that morning. He didn™t see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed \\n\\nopen-mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most\\n of them had never se\\nen an owl even at \\nnighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly \\nnormal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five \\ndifferent people. He made severa\\nl important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a \\nvery good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he™d\\n stretch his legs and walk across the road \\nto buy himself a bun from the bakery. \\n \\n      He™d forgotten all about the people in cloaks\\n until he passed a group of them next to the baker™s. \\nHe eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn™t know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch \\nwere whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn™t see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a la\\nrge doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were saying.  \\n      ﬁThe Potters, that™s right, that™s what I heard Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁ Š yes, their son, Harry Šﬂ \\n \\n      Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He\\n looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it. \\n \\n      He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished\\n dialing his home number\\n when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back down and str\\noked his mustache, thinking– no, he was being \\nstupid. Potter wasn™t such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter \\nwho had a son called Harry. Come to think \\nof it, he wasn™t even sure his nephew was called Harry. He™d never even seen the boy. It might ha\\nve been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her \\nsister. He didn™t blame \\nher Š if he™d had a sister like that– but all the same, those people in cloaks–  \\n       He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o™clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door. \\n \\n      ﬁSorry,ﬂ he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost \\nfell. It was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a \\nviolet cloak. He didn™t seem at all upset at \\nbeing almost knocked to the ground. On the contrar\\ny, his face split into a wide smile and he said \\nin a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, ﬁD\\non™t be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could \\nupset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who ha\\ns gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!ﬂ  \\n      And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off. \\n\\n \\n      Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete stranger. He also \\nthought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining th\\nings, which he had never hoped before, because he didn™t approve of imagination. \\n \\n      As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he sawŠand it didn™t improve his \\nmood Š was the tabby cat he™d spotted that morning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He \\n\\nwas sure it was the same one; it had the same markings around its eyes. \\n \\n      ﬁShoo!ﬂ said Mr. Dursley loudly. \\n \\n      The cat didn™t move. It \\njust gave him a stern look. Was this\\n normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley \\nwondered. Trying to pull himself together, he let \\nhimself into the house. He was still determined \\nnot to mention anything to his wife. \\n \\n      Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. Sh\\ne told him over dinner all \\nabout Mrs. Next Door™s problems with her daughter and how Dudley had \\nlearned a new word (ﬁWon™t!ﬂ). Mr. Dursley \\ntried to act normally. When Dudley had been put \\nto bed, he went into the living room in time to \\ncatch the last report on the evening news: \\n \\n      ﬁAnd finally, bird-watchers everywhere have repor\\nted that the nation™s owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of these \\nbirds flying in every direction since sunrise. \\nExperts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.ﬂ The newscaster allowed himself a grin. ﬁMost myster\\nious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?ﬂ        ﬁWell, Ted,ﬂ said the weatherman, ﬁI don™t k\\nnow about that, but it™s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they™ve had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebra\\nting Bonfire Night early Š it™s not until next \\nweek, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight.ﬂ \\n \\n      Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. \\nShooting stars all over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? \\nMysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters–  \\n \\n      Mrs. Dursley came into the living room ca\\nrrying two cups of tea. It was no good. He™d have to say something to her. He cleared his throat ne\\nrvously. ﬁEr Š Petunia, dear Š you haven™t heard from your sister lately, have you?ﬂ \\n \\n      As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn™t have a sister.  \\n      ﬁNo,ﬂ she said sharply. ﬁWhy?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁFunny stuff on the news,ﬂ Mr. Dursley mumb\\nled. ﬁOwls– shooting stars– and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today–ﬂ  \\n      ﬁSo?ﬂ snapped Mrs. Dursley.  \\n      ﬁWell, I just thought– ma\\nybe– it was something to do with– you know– \\nher crowd.ﬂ  \\n      Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he™d heard the name ﬁPotter.ﬂ He decided he didn™t\\n dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, ﬁTheir son Š he™d be about Dudley™s age now, wouldn™t he?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁI suppose so,ﬂ said Mrs. Dursley stiffly. \\n \\n      ﬁWhat™s his name again? Howard, isn™t it?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁHarry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁOh, yes,ﬂ said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. ﬁYes, I quite agree.ﬂ  \\n      He didn™t say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed. While Mrs. Dursley was \\nin the bathroom, Mr. Dursley cr\\nept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front \\ngarden. The cat was still there. It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something. \\n \\n      Was he imagining things? Could all this have\\n anything to do with the Potters? If it did– if it got \\nout that they were related to a pair of Š well, he didn™t think he could bear it.  \\n      The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr. Du\\nrsley lay awake, turning it \\nall over in his mind. His last, comforting thought before\\n he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs. Dursley. The Potters \\nknew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind– He couldn™t see how \\nhe and Petunia could get mixed up in anything th\\nat might be going on Š he yawned and turned \\nover Š it couldn™t affect them–   \\n      How very wrong he was. \\n \\n      Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into\\n an uneasy sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn™t so much\\n as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. In \\nfact, it was nearly midnight before the cat \\nmoved at all.  \\n      A man appeared on the corner the cat had \\nbeen watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you™d have thought he™d just popped out of the ground. The cat™s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.  \\n      Nothing like this man had ever been seen\\n on Privet Drive. He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man™s name was Albus \\nDumbledore. \\n \\n      Albus Dumbledore didn™t seem\\n to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything \\nfrom his name to his boots was unwelcome. He\\n was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realize he was \\nbeing watched, because he looked up suddenly at \\nthe cat, which was still staring at him from the \\nother end of the street. For some reason, the sight \\nof the cat seemed to amuse him. He c\\nhuckled and muttered, ﬁI should have known.ﬂ \\n \\n      He found what he was looking for in his inside\\n pocket. It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. \\nHe flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He clicked it again Š the next lamp f\\nlickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked \\nthe Put-Outer, until the only lights left on th\\ne whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching him. If an\\nyone looked out of their window now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn™t be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-\\nOuter back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat down on \\nthe wall next to the cat. He didn™t look at it, but after a moment he spoke to it. \\n \\n      ﬁFancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.ﬂ \\n \\n      He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling at a rather severe-looking \\nwoman who was wearing square glasses exactly \\nthe shape of the markings the cat had had \\naround its eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a \\ntight bun. She looked distinctly ruffled. \\n      ﬁHow did you know it was me?ﬂ she asked. \\n \\n      ﬁMy dear Professor, I™ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁYou™d be stiff if you™d been sitting on a brick wall all day,ﬂ said Professor McGonagall. \\n \\n      ﬁAll day? When you could have been celebra\\nting? I must have passed a \\ndozen feasts and parties on my way here.ﬂ \\n \\n      Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily. \\n \\n      ﬁOh yes, everyone™s celebrating, all right,ﬂ she said impatien\\ntly. ﬁYou™d think they™d be a bit more careful, but no Š even the Muggles have noticed something™s going on. It was on their \\nnews.ﬂ She jerked her head back at the Dursleys™ dark living-room \\nwindow. ﬁI heard it. Flocks of owls– shooting stars– Well, they™re not completely stupid. They were bound to notice \\nsomething. Shooting stars down in Kent Š I™ll bet \\nthat was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much \\n\\nsense.ﬂ   \\n      ﬁYou can™t blame them,ﬂ said Dumbledore ge\\nntly. ﬁWe™ve had precious little to celebrate for \\neleven years.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁI know that,ﬂ said Professor McGonagall \\nirritably. ﬁBut that™s no reason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.ﬂ \\n \\n      She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though hoping he was going to tell \\nher something, but he didn™t, so she went on. ﬁA \\nfine thing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared at last, th\\ne Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he \\nreally has gone, Dumbledore?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁIt certainly seems so,ﬂ said Dumbledore. ﬁW\\ne have much to be thankful for. Would you care for \\na lemon drop?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁA what?ﬂ  \\n      ﬁA lemon drop. They™re a kind of Muggle sweet I™m rather fond of.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁNo, thank you,ﬂ said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn™t think this was the moment for lemon drops. ﬁAs I say, even if You-Know-Who \\nhas gone Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁMy dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name? All this \\n‚You-Know-Who™ nonsense Š for eleven years I ha\\nve been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: \\nVoldemort.ﬂ Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was \\nunsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice. \\nﬁIt all gets so confusing if we keep saying ‚You-Know-Who.™ I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort™s name.ﬂ \\n       ﬁI know you haven™t,ﬂ said Professor McGonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring. \\nﬁBut you™re different. Everyone knows you™re the only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.ﬂ        ﬁYou flatter me,ﬂ said Dumbledore calmly. ﬁVoldemort had powers I will never have.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁOnly because you™re too Š well Š\\nnoble to use them.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁIt™s lucky it™s dark. I haven™t blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new \\nearmuffs.ﬂ \\n \\n      Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said ﬁThe owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around. You know what they™re saying? About w\\nhy he™s disappeared? \\nAbout what finally stopped him?ﬂ \\n \\n      It seemed that Professo\\nr McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman \\nhad she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing star\\ne as she did now. It was plain that whatever ﬁeveryoneﬂ was saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true. \\nDumbledore, however, was choosing anot\\nher lemon drop and did not answer.  \\n      ﬁWhat they™re \\nsaying\\n,ﬂ she pressed on, ﬁis that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric™s \\nHollow. He went to find the Potters. The rumor \\nis that Lily and James Potter are Š are Š that \\nthey™re Š dead\\n.ﬂ  \\n      Dumbledore bowed his h\\nead. Professor McGonagall gasped.  \\n      ﬁLily and James– I can™t believe it–\\n I didn™t want to believe it– Oh, Albus–ﬂ \\n \\n      Dumbledore reached out and patted her on \\nthe shoulder. ﬁI know– I know–ﬂ he said heavily.  \\n      Professor McGonagall™s voice trembled as she went on. ﬁThat™s not all. They™re saying he tried to kill the Potter™s son, Harry. But he couldn™t.\\n He couldn™t kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but they™re saying that when he couldn™t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort™s power \\nsomehow broke Š and that™s why he™s gone.ﬂ \\n \\n      Dumbledore nodded glumly. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁIt™s Š it™s true?ﬂ faltered Professor McGonagall. ﬁAft\\ner all he™s done– all the people he™s killed– he couldn™t kill a little boy? It™s just astounding– of all the things to stop him– but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWe can only guess.ﬂ said Dumbledore. ﬁWe may never know.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her \\nspectacles. Dumbledore gave a \\ngreat sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch. It had twel\\nve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets \\nwere moving around the edge. It must have made\\n sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it \\nback in his pocket and said, ﬁHagrid™s late. I suppose it was he who told you I™d be here, by the way?ﬂ \\n       ﬁYes,ﬂ said Professor McGonagall. ﬁAnd I don™t suppose you™re going to tell me \\nwhy you™re here, of all places?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁI™ve come to bring Harry to his aunt \\nand uncle. They™re the only family he has left now.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁYou don™t mean Œ you \\ncan™t mean the people who live \\nhere\\n?ﬂ cried Professor McGonagall, \\njumping to her feet and pointing at number four. ﬁDumbledore Š you can™t. I™ve been watching \\n\\nthem all day. You couldn™t find two people who ar\\ne less like us. And they™ve got this son Š I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come \\n\\nand live here!ﬂ  \\n      ﬁIt™s the best place for him,ﬂ said Dumbledore \\nfirmly. ﬁHis aunt and uncle will be able to explain \\neverything to him when he™s olde\\nr. I™ve written them a letter.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁA letter?ﬂ repeated Professor McG\\nonagall faintly, sitting back down on the wall. ﬁReally, \\nDumbledore, you think you can explain all this \\nin a letter? These people will never understand him! He™ll be famous Š a legend Š I wouldn™t be\\n surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future Š there will be books written\\n about Harry Š every child in our world will \\nknow his name!ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁExactly.ﬂ said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses. ﬁIt \\nwould be enough to turn any boy™s head. Famous \\nbefore he can walk and talk! Famous for \\n\\nsomething he won™t even remember! Can you see \\nhow much better off he™ll be, growing up away \\nfrom all that until he™s ready to take it?ﬂ \\n \\n      Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, ch\\nanged her mind, swallowed, and then said, ﬁYes Š \\nyes, you™re right, of course. But how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?ﬂ She eyed his cloak \\nsuddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it.  \\n      ﬁHagrid™s bringing him.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁYou think it Šwise Š to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁI would trust Hagrid with my life,ﬂ said Dumbledore. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁI™m not saying his heart isn™t in the ri\\nght place,ﬂ said Professor \\nMcGonagall grudgingly, ﬁbut you can™t pretend he™s not careless. He does tend to Š what was that?ﬂ  \\n      A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a \\nheadlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky Š and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them. \\n       If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to\\n the man sitting astride it. He was almost twice as \\ntall as a normal man and at least five times as \\nwide. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and \\nso wild Š long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his \\nface, he had hands the size \\nof trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular \\narms he was holding a bundle of blankets. \\n \\n      ﬁHagrid,ﬂ said Dumbledore, soundi\\nng relieved. ﬁAt last. And where did you get that motorcycle?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁBorrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,ﬂ sa\\nid the giant, climbing carefully off the motorcycle \\nas he spoke. ﬁYoung Sirius Black lent it to me. I™ve got him, sir.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁNo problems, were there?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁNo, sir Š house was almost destroyed, but \\nI got him out all right before the Muggles started \\nswarmin™ around. He fell asleep as\\n we was flyin™ over Bristol.ﬂ \\n \\n      Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent \\nforward over the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet-black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut,\\n like a bolt of lightning.  \\n      ﬁIs that where Š?ﬂ \\nwhispered Professor McGonagall. \\n \\n      ﬁYes,ﬂ said Dumbledore.\\n ﬁHe™ll have that scar forever.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁCouldn™t you do something about it, Dumbledore?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁEven if I could, I wouldn™t. Scars can come\\n in handy. I have one myself above my left knee that \\nis a perfect map of the London Underground. Well \\nŠ give him here, Hagrid Š we™d better get \\nthis over with.ﬂ  \\n      Dumbledore took Harry in his arms\\n and turned toward the Dursleys™ house.  \\n      ﬁCould I Š could I say good-bye to him, sir?ﬂ \\nasked Hagrid. He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very\\n scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid \\nlet out a howl like a wounded dog.  \\n      ﬁShhh!ﬂ hissed Professor McGonagall, ﬁYou™ll wake the Muggles!ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁS-s-sorry,ﬂ sobbed Hagrid, taking out a la\\nrge, spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it. \\nﬁBut I c-c-can™t stand it ŠLily an™ James dead \\nŠ an™ poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁYes, yes, it™s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we™ll be found,ﬂ Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low \\ngarden wall and walked to the front door. He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry™s blankets, and then came \\nback to the other two. For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at \\nthe little bundle; Hagrid™s shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore™s eyes seemed to have gone out. \\n       ﬁWell,ﬂ said Dumbledore finally, ﬁthat™s \\nthat. We™ve no business staying here. We may as well \\ngo and join the celebrations.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁYeah,ﬂ said Hagrid in a very muffled voi\\nce, \"I best get this bike away. G™night, Professor McGonagall Š Professor Dumbledore, sir.ﬂ \\n \\n      Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket \\nsleeve, Hagrid swung himsel\\nf onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it\\n rose into the air and off into the night.  \\n      ﬁI shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,ﬂ said Dumbledore, nodding to her. \\nProfessor McGonagall blew her nose in reply.  \\n      Dumbledore turned and walked back down th\\ne street. On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and twelve ba\\nlls of light sped back to their street lamps so \\nthat Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and \\nhe could make out a ta\\nbby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street. He could \\njust see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four. \\n \\n      ﬁGood luck, Harry,ﬂ he murmured. He turned\\n on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone.  \\n      A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the \\nvery last place you would expect astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his \\n\\nblankets without waking up. One small hand closed\\n on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was fam\\nous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours™ time by Mrs. Dursley™s scream as she ope\\nned the front door to put out the milk bottles, \\n\\nnor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley– He couldn™t know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were \\n\\nholding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: ﬁTo Harry Potter Š the boy who lived!ﬂ  \\n           \\n  \\n CHAPTER TWO \\n  The Vanishing Glass    \\n  Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursle\\nys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and \\nlit up the brass number four on the Dursleys™ fron\\nt door; it crept into their living room, which \\nwas almost exactly the same as it had been on th\\ne night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the photographs\\n on the mantelpiece really showed how much \\ntime had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots\\n of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets Š \\nbut Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and \\nnow the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. The room held \\nno sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too.  \\n      Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at\\n the moment, but not for l\\nong. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day. \\n \\n      ﬁUp! Get up! Now!ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again. \\n \\n      ﬁUp!ﬂ she screeched. Harry heard her walk\\ning toward the kitchen a\\nnd then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he \\nhad been having. It had been a good one. There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a \\nfunny feeling he™d had the same dream before. \\n       His aunt was back outside the door. \\n \\n      ﬁAre you up yet?ﬂ she demanded. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁNearly,ﬂ said Harry. \\n \\n      ﬁWell, get a move on, I want you to look \\nafter the bacon. And don™t you dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy™s birthday.ﬂ  \\n      Harry groaned. \\n \\n      ﬁWhat did you say?ﬂ his aunt snapped through the door. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁNothing, nothing–ﬂ \\n \\n      Dudley™s birthday Š how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly\\n out of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider\\n off one of them, put \\nthem on. Harry was used to spiders, because the \\ncupboard under the stairs was full of them, and \\nthat was where he slept. \\n       When he was dressed he went down the \\nhall into the kitchen. The table was almost hidden \\nbeneath all Dudley™s birthday presents. It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer \\nhe wanted, not to mention the second television \\nand the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley\\n was very fat and hated exercise Š unless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudley\\n™s favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn™t often catch him. Harry didn™t look it, but he was very fast.  \\n      Perhaps it had something to do with living in\\n a dark cupboard, but Harry had always been small \\nand skinny for his age. He looked even smaller an\\nd skinnier than he really was because all he \\nhad to wear were old clothes of Dudley™s, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. \\nHarry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, \\nand bright green eyes. He wore round glasses \\nheld together with a lot of Scotch tape becau\\nse of all the times Dudley had punched him on the \\nnose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could remember, and the first \\nquestion he could ever remember asking hi\\ns Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it.  \\n      ﬁIn the car crash when your parents died,ﬂ she had said. ﬁAnd don™t ask questions.ﬂ  \\n      Don™t ask questions Š that was the first rule for a \\nquiet life with the Dursleys. \\n \\n      Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon.  \\n      ﬁComb your hair!ﬂ he ba\\nrked, by way of a morning greeting.        About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircu\\nts than the rest of the boys in his class put together, but it made no difference, his hair \\nsimply grew that way Š all over the place. \\n       Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arri\\nved in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked \\na lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not much neck, \\nsmall, watery blue eyes, and \\nthick blond hair that lay smoothl\\ny on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley \\nlooked like a baby angel Š Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig.  \\n      Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as there wasn™t much \\nroom. Dudley, meanwhile, was counti\\nng his presents. His face fell.  \\n      ﬁThirty-six,ﬂ he said, looking up at his mo\\nther and father. ﬁThat™s two less than last year.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁDarling, you haven™t counted Auntie Marge™\\ns present, see, it™s here under this big one from \\nMummy and Daddy.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁAll right, thirty-seven then,ﬂ said D\\nudley, going red in the face. Harry, who could see a huge \\nDudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his \\nbacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over. \\n      Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger,\\n too, because she said quickly, ﬁAnd we™ll buy you \\nanother two presents while we™re out today. How™s that, popkin? \\nTwo more presents. Is that all \\nrightﬂ        Dudley thought for a moment. It looked like\\n hard work. Finally he said slowly, ﬁSo I™ll have thirty– thirty–ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁThirty-nine, sweetums,ﬂ said Aunt Petunia. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁOh.ﬂ Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. ﬁAll right then.ﬂ  \\n      Uncle Vernon chuckled. \\n \\n      ﬁLittle tyke wants his money™s worth, ju\\nst like his father. ™Atta boy, Dudley!ﬂ He ruffled \\nDudley™s hair.  \\n      At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt\\n Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, \\nsixteen new computer games, and a VCR. He wa\\ns ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when \\nAunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried. \\n \\n      ﬁBad news, Vernon,ﬂ she said. ﬁMrs. Figg™s broken her leg. She can™t take him.ﬂ She jerked her \\nhead in Harry™s direction.  \\n      Dudley™s mouth fell open in horror, but Ha\\nrry™s heart gave a leap. Every year on Dudley™s \\nbirthday, his parents took him \\nand a friend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger \\nrestaurants, or the movies. Ever\\ny year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who \\nlived two streets away. Harry hated it there. The whole house sme\\nlled of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of \\nall the cats she™d ever owned.  \\n      ﬁNow what?ﬂ said Aunt Petunia, looking fu\\nriously at Harry as though he™d planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken her leg, but it wasn™t easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before\\n he had to look at Tibbles, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again.  \\n      ﬁWe could phone Marge,ﬂ Uncle Vernon suggested. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁDon™t be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.ﬂ \\n \\n      The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn™t there Š or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn™t understand them, like a slug. \\n \\n      ﬁWhat about what™s-her-name, your friend Š Yvonne?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁOn vacation in Majorca,ﬂ snapped Aunt Petunia. \\n       ﬁYou could just leave me here,ﬂ Harry put in\\n hopefully (he™d be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even\\n have a go on Dudley™s computer). \\n       Aunt Petunia looked as though she™d just swallowed a lemon. \\n \\n      ﬁAnd come back and find \\nthe house in ruins?ﬂ she snarled. \\n \\n      ﬁI won™t blow up the house,ﬂ said Harry, but they weren™t listening. \\n \\n      ﬁI suppose we could take him to the zoo,ﬂ\\n said Aunt Petunia slowly, ﬁ– and leave him in the \\ncar–ﬂ  \\n      ﬁThat car™s new, he™s not sitting in it alone–ﬂ \\n \\n      Dudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn\\n™t really crying Š it had been years since he™d really cried Š but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed, his mo\\nther would give him \\nanything he wanted.  \\n      ﬁDinky Duddydums, don™t cry, Mummy won™\\nt let him spoil your special day!ﬂ she cried, \\nflinging her arms around him. \\n \\n      ﬁI– don™t– want– him– t-\\nt-to come!ﬂ Dudley yelled betw\\neen huge, pretend sobs. ﬁHe always sp-spoils everything!ﬂ He shot Harry a nasty \\ngrin through the gap in his mother™s arms. \\n \\n      Just then, the doorbell rang Š ﬁOh, good Lor\\nd, they™re here!ﬂ said Aunt Petunia frantically Š and a moment later, Dudley™s best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers was a \\nscrawny boy with a face like a rat. He was usuall\\ny the one who held people™s arms behind their \\nbacks while Dudley hit them. Dudley\\n stopped pretending to cry at once.        Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn™t believ\\ne his luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys™ car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo fo\\nr the first time in his life. His aunt and uncle \\nhadn™t been able to think of anything else to do with him, but \\nbefore they™d left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside. \\n \\n      ﬁI™m warning you,ﬂ he had said, putting hi\\ns large purple face right up close to Harry™s, ﬁI™m \\nwarning you now, boy Š any funny business, anything at all Š and you™ll be in that cupboard \\nfrom now until Christmas.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁI™m not going to do a\\nnything,ﬂ said Harry, ﬁhonestly–ﬂ  \\n      But Uncle Vernon didn™t believe him. No one ever did. \\n\\n \\n      The problem was, strange things often \\nhappened around Harry and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn™t make them happen. \\n \\n      Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry comi\\nng back from the barbers looking as though he hadn™t \\nbeen at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald \\nexcept for his bangs, which she left ﬁto hide that horrible scar.ﬂ Dudley had laughed himself silly \\nat Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagini\\nng school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses. Next morning, however, he had gotten up to \\n\\nfind his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off. He had been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he couldn™t explain how it had grown back so quickly.  \\n      Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to\\n force him into a revolting old sweater of Dudley™s \\n(brown with orange puff balls). The harder she tried to \\npull it over his head, the smaller it seemed \\nto become, until finally it might have fitted a ha\\nnd puppet, but certainly w\\nouldn™t fit Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry wasn™t \\npunished.  \\n      On the other hand, he™d gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens. Dudley™s gang had been chasing him as \\nusual when, as much to Harry™s surprise as \\nanyone else™s, there he was sitting on the chimney. \\nThe Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harry™s headmistress telling them Harry ha\\nd been climbing school bu\\nildings. But all he™d tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon thro\\nugh the locked door of his cupboard) was jump \\n\\nbehind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the wind must have \\ncaught him in mid-jump. \\n \\n      But today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn™t school,\\n his cupboard, or Mrs. Figg™s cabbage-smelling \\nliving room. \\n       While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to \\nAunt Petunia. He liked to complain about things: \\npeople at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harry were just \\na few of his favorite \\nsubjects. This morning, it was motorcycles. \\n       ﬁ– roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodl\\nums,ﬂ he said, as a motorcycle overtook them. \\n \\n      ﬁI had a dream about a motorcycle,ﬂ \\nsaid Harry, remembering suddenly. ﬁIt was flying.ﬂ \\n \\n      Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet with\\n a mustache: ﬁMOTORCYCLES DON™T FLY!ﬂ \\n \\n      Dudley and Piers sniggered. \\n \\n      ﬁI know they don™t,ﬂ said Harry. ﬁIt was only a dream.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      But he wished he hadn™t said anything. If there was one thing the Dursleys hated even more than \\nhis asking questions, it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldn™t, no matter if it \\nwas in a dream or even a cartoon Š they seem\\ned to think he might get dangerous ideas. \\n \\n      It was a very sunny Saturday and the \\nzoo was crowded with families. The Dursleys bought \\nDudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at \\nthe entrance and then, because the smiling lady in \\nthe van had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a \\ncheap lemon ice pop. It wasn™t bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla \\n\\nscratching its head who looked remarkably \\nlike Dudley, except that it wasn™t blond.  \\n      Harry had the best morning he™d had in a long time. He was careful to walk a little way apart \\nfrom the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, wh\\no were starting to get bored with the animals by \\nlunchtime, wouldn™t fall back on their favor\\nite hobby of hitting him. They ate in the zoo \\nrestaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum b\\necause his knickerbocker glory didn™t have enough \\nice cream on top, Uncle Vernon \\nbought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the \\nfirst. \\n \\n      Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to last.  \\n      After lunch they went to the reptile house.\\n It was cool and dark in\\n there, with lit windows all \\nalong the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wa\\nnted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, \\nman-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the la\\nrgest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon™s car and crushed it into a trash can Š but at the \\n\\nmoment it didn™t look in the mood. \\nIn fact, it was fast asleep.  \\n      Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils.  \\n      ﬁMake it move,ﬂ he whined at his father. \\nUncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn™t budge.        ﬁDo it again,ﬂ Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon\\n rapped the glass smartly w\\nith his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on.        ﬁThis is boring,ﬂ Dudley moaned. He shuffled away. \\n\\n \\n      Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He wouldn™t have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself \\nŠ no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a \\nbedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petuni\\na hammering on the door to wake you up; at \\nleast he got to visit the rest of the house.  \\n      The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Sl\\nowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes \\nwere on a level with Harry™s.  \\n      It winked. \\n \\n      Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. They weren™t. He looked back at the snake and winked, too.  \\n      The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly:        ﬁI get that all the time.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁI know,ﬂ Harry murmured through the gla\\nss, though he wasn™t sure the snake could hear him. ﬁIt must be really annoying.ﬂ \\n \\n      The snake nodded vigorously. \\n \\n      ﬁWhere do you come from, anyway?ﬂ Harry asked. \\n\\n \\n      The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at it.  \\n      Boa Constrictor, Brazil. \\n \\n      ﬁWas it nice there?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo. ﬁOh, I see Š so you™ve never been to Brazil?ﬂ  \\n      As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of them jump. \\nﬁDUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LO\\nOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU WON™T \\nBELIEVE WHAT IT™S DOING!ﬂ  \\n      Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could. \\n\\n       ﬁOut of the way, you,ﬂ he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened so\\n fast no one saw how it happened Š one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning ri\\nght up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror.        Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor™s tank had vanished. The great \\nsnake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits. \\n \\n      As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, \\nﬁBrazil, \\nhere I come– Thanksss, amigo.ﬂ\\n  \\n      The keeper of the reptile house was in shock. \\n \\n      ﬁBut the glass,ﬂ he kept saying, ﬁwhere did the glass go?ﬂ  \\n      The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, \\nsweet tea while he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn™t done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back \\n\\nin Uncle Vernon™s car, Dudley was telling them how it \\nhad nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeez\\ne him to death. But worst of all,\\n for Harry at least, was Piers \\ncalming down enough to say, ﬁHarry was \\ntalking to it, weren™t you, Harry?ﬂ \\n       Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely \\nout of the house before starting on Harry. He was so \\nangry he could hardly speak. He managed to sa\\ny, ﬁGo Š cupboard Š stay Š no meals,ﬂ before \\nhe collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy. \\n   Harry lay in his dark cupboard\\n much later, wishing he had a watch. He didn™t know what time it \\nwas and he couldn™t be sure the Dursleys were \\nasleep yet. Until they were, he couldn™t risk \\nsneaking to the kitchen for some food. \\n \\n      He™d lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable year\\ns, as long as he could remember, ever since he™d been a baby and his \\nparents had died in that car crash. He couldn™t remember being in the car when his parents had \\ndied. Sometimes, when he strained his memory \\nduring long hours in his cupboard, he came up with \\na strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on his forehead. This, he supposed, was the crash, though he couldn™t imagine where all the green light \\ncame from. He couldn™t remember \\nhis parents at all. His aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course \\nhe was forbidden to ask questions. There were \\nno photographs of them in the house. \\n \\n      When he had been younger, Harry had \\ndreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming \\nto take him away, but it had never happened; the \\nDursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes \\nhe thought (or maybe hoped) that\\n strangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange \\nstrangers they were, too. A tiny man in a viol\\net top hat had bowed to him once while out \\nshopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man, Aunt \\nPetunia had rushed them out of the shop \\nwithout buying anything. A wild-looking old woman \\ndressed all in green had waved merrily at him \\nonce on a bus. A bald man in a very long purple \\ncoat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second \\nHarry tried to get a closer look.  \\n      At school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley™s gang hated that odd Harry Potter in \\nhis baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley™s gang.  \\n           \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  CHAPTER THREE   Letters From No One \\n \\n The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor \\nearned Harry his longest-ever punishment. By the \\ntime he was allowed out of his cupboard again, th\\ne summer holidays had started and Dudley had \\nalready broken his new video camera, crashed his \\nremote control airplane, and, first time out on \\nhis racing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet Drive on her crutches. \\n \\n      Harry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley™s gang, who visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all bi\\ng and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all quite happy to \\njoin in Dudley™s favorite sport: Harry Hunting.  \\n      This was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house, wandering around and \\nthinking about the end of the holidays, where he\\n could see a tiny ray of hope. When September \\ncame he would be going off to s\\necondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn™t be \\nwith Dudley. Dudley had been accepted at Un\\ncle Vernon™s old private school, Smeltings. Piers \\nPolkiss was going there too. Harry, on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local \\npublic school. Dudley thought this was very funny.  \\n      ﬁThey stuff people™s heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall,ﬂ he told Harry. ﬁWant to \\ncome upstairs and practice?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁNo, thanks,ﬂ said Harry. ﬁThe poor toilet\\n™s never had anything as horrible as your head down it Š it might be sick.ﬂ Then he ran, before \\nDudley could work out what he™d said.  \\n      One day in July, Aunt Petunia took D\\nudley to London to buy his Smeltings uniform, leaving \\nHarry at Mrs. Figg™s. Mrs. Figg wasn™t as bad as usual. It turned out she™d broken her leg tripping over one of her cats, and she didn™t seem quite as fond of them as before. She let Harry \\nwatch television and gave him a bit of chocolat\\ne cake that tasted as though she™d had it for several years.  \\n      That evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brand-new uniform. \\nSmeltings™ boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange \\nknickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters. They also carried knobbly sticks, used fo\\nr hitting each other while the teachers weren™t looking. This was supposed to be good training for later life.  \\n      As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst in\\nto tears and said she couldn™t believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he looked so handsome and gr\\nown-up. Harry didn™t trust himself to speak. He \\nthought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh. \\n  There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next\\n morning when Harry went in for breakfast. It \\nseemed to be coming from a large metal tub in \\nthe sink. He went to have a look. The tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water.        ﬁWhat™s this?ﬂ he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips\\n tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question.  \\n      ﬁYour new school uniform,ﬂ she said. \\n\\n \\n      Harry looked in the bowl again. \\n \\n      ﬁOh,ﬂ he said, ﬁI didn™t realize it had to be so wet.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁDon™t be stupid,ﬂ snapped Aunt Petunia. ﬁI™m dyeing some of Dudley™s old things gray for you. \\nIt™ll look just like everyone else™s when I™ve finished.ﬂ  \\n      Harry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue. He sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his first day at Stonewall High Š like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin, probably.  \\n      Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with \\nwrinkled noses because of the smell from Harry™s \\nnew uniform. Uncle Vernon opened his newspape\\nr as usual and Dudley banged his Smelting \\nstick, which he carried everywhere, on the table.  \\n      They heard the click of the mail \\nslot and flop of letters on the doormat. \\n \\n      ﬁGet the mail, Dudley,ﬂ sa\\nid Uncle Vernon from behind his paper. \\n       ﬁMake Harry get it.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁGet the mail, Harry.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁMake Dudley get it.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁPoke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      Harry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail. Three things lay on the doormat: a \\npostcard from Uncle Vernon™s sister Marge, wh\\no was vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown \\nenvelope that looked like a bill, and Š a letter for Harry.  \\n      Harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant elastic band. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him. Who would? \\nHe had no friends, no other relatives Š he didn™t belong to the library, so he™d never even got rude notes asking for books back. Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake: \\n   Mr. H. Potter    The Cupboard under the Stairs \\n  4 Privet Drive \\n \\n  Little Whinging \\n\\n \\n Surrey    The envelope was thick and heavy, made of yello\\nwish parchment, and the address was written in \\nemerald-green ink. There was no stamp. \\n \\n      Turning the envelope over, his hand tremb\\nling, Harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, \\nand a snake surrounding a large letter H.  \\n      ﬁHurry up, boy!ﬂ shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. ﬁWhat are you doing, checking for \\nletter bombs?ﬂ He chuc\\nkled at his own joke. \\n \\n      Harry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter. He handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to open the yellow envelope.  \\n      Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and flipped over the postcard.  \\n      ﬁMarge™s ill,ﬂ he informed Aunt Petunia. ﬁAte a funny whelk–ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁDad!ﬂ said Dudley suddenly. ﬁDad, Harry™s got something!ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      Harry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was written on the same heavy parchment \\nas the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of his hand by Uncle Vernon.  \\n      ﬁThat™s mine!ﬂ said Harry, trying to snatch it back.  \\n      ﬁWho™d be writing to you?ﬂ sneered Uncl\\ne Vernon, shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it. His face went from \\nred to green faster than a set of traffic lights. And it didn™t stop \\nthere. Within seconds it was th\\ne grayish white of old porridge.  \\n      ﬁP-P-Petunia!ﬂ he gasped. \\n \\n      Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon \\nheld it high out of his reach. Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the first line. For a mo\\nment it looked as though she might \\nfaint. She clutched her throat and made a choking noise. \\n \\n      ﬁVernon! Oh my goodness Š Vernon!ﬂ  \\n\\n \\n      They stared at each other, seeming to have\\n forgotten that Harry and Dudley were still in the \\nroom. Dudley wasn™t used to being ignored. He ga\\nve his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick. \\n \\n      ﬁI want to read that letter,ﬂ he said loudly.       ﬁI want to read it,ﬂ said Harry furiously, ﬁas it™s mine.ﬂ        ﬁGet out, both of you,ﬂ croaked Uncle Ver\\nnon, stuffing the letter back inside its envelope.  \\n      Harry didn™t move. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁI WANT MY LETTER!ﬂ he shouted. \\n \\n      ﬁLet me see it!ﬂ demanded Dudley. \\n \\n      ﬁOUT!ﬂ roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the \\nkitchen door behind them. Harry and Dudley \\n\\npromptly had a furious but silent fight over w\\nho would listen at the keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry, his glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat \\non his stomach to listen at the crack between \\ndoor and floor.  \\n      ﬁVernon,ﬂ Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, ﬁlook at the address Š how could they possibly know where he sleeps? You don™\\nt think they™re watching the house?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWatching Š spying Š might be \\nfollowing us,ﬂ muttered Uncle Vernon wildly. \\n \\n      ﬁBut what should we do, Vernon? Shoul\\nd we write back? Tell them we don™t want Šﬂ \\n \\n      Harry could see Uncle Vernon™s shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen.  \\n      ﬁNo,ﬂ he said finally. ﬁNo, we™ll ignore it. If they don™t get an answer– Yes, that™s best– we \\nwon™t do anything–ﬂ  \\n      ﬁBut Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁI™m not having one in the house, Petunia! \\nDidn™t we swear when we took him in we™d stamp out \\nthat dangerous nonsense?ﬂ \\n \\n  That evening when he got back from work, \\nUncle Vernon did something he™d never done before; \\nhe visited Harry in his cupboard. \\n \\n      ﬁWhere™s my letter?ﬂ said Harry, the \\nmoment Uncle Vernon had squeezed through the door. \\nﬁWho™s writing to me?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁNo one. It was addressed to you by mistak\\ne,ﬂ said Uncle Vernon shortly. ﬁI have burned it.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁIt was not a mistake,ﬂ said Harry angril\\ny, ﬁit had my cupboard on it.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁSILENCE!ﬂ yelled Uncle Vernon, and a co\\nuple of spiders fell from the ceiling. He took a few \\ndeep breaths and then forced his face in\\nto a smile, which looked quite painful. \\n       ﬁEr Š yes, Harry Š about this cupboard. Your aunt and I have been thinking– you™re really getting a bit big for it– we think it might be nice if you move\\nd into Dudley™s second bedroom. \\n       ﬁWhy?ﬂ said Harry. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁDon™t ask questions!ﬂ snapped his uncle. ﬁTake this stuff upstairs, now.ﬂ \\n \\n      The Dursleys™ house had four bedrooms:\\n one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon™s sister, Marge), one where Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldn™t fit into his first bedroom. It only took Harry one trip \\nupstairs to move everything he owned from the \\ncupboard to this room. He sat down on the bed \\n\\nand stared around him. Nearly everything in he\\nre was broken. The mont\\nh-old video camera was \\nlying on top of a small, working tank Dudley \\nhad once driven over the next door neighbor™s dog; \\nin the corner was Dudley™s first-ever television set, which he™d put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled; there was \\na large birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all \\nbent because Dudley had sat on it. Other shelves we\\nre full of books. They were the only things in \\nthe room that looked as though they™d never been touched. \\n \\n      From downstairs came the sound \\nof Dudley bawling at his mother, ﬁI don™t \\nwant him in there– I \\nneed that room– make him get out–ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday he™d have give\\nn anything to be up here. Today he™d rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without it.  \\n  Next morning at breakfast, everyone was rath\\ner quiet. Dudley was in shock. He™d screamed, \\nwhacked his father with his Smelting stick, been \\nsick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown \\nhis tortoise through the greenhouse roof, and he still didn™t have his room back. Harry was \\nthinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wish\\ning he™d opened the letter in the hall. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly. \\n \\n      When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who \\nseemed to be trying to be nice to Harry, made \\nDudley go and get it. They heard him banging things with his Smelting stick all the way down \\nthe hall. Then he shouted, ﬁThere™s another one! ‚Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet \\nDrive Š™ﬂ  \\n      With a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt fr\\nom his seat and ran down the hall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to th\\ne ground to get the letter from him, which was \\nmade difficult by the fact that Harry had gr\\nabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind. \\nAfter a minute of confused fighting, in which \\neveryone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick, Uncle \\nVernon straightened up, gasping for breath, with Harry™s letter clutched in his hand.  \\n      ﬁGo to your cupboard Š I mean, your bedroom,ﬂ he wheezed at Harry. ﬁDudley Š go Š just \\ngo.ﬂ  \\n      Harry walked round and round his new room. Someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard \\nand they seemed to know he hadn™t \\nreceived his first letter. Surely\\n that meant they™d try again? \\nAnd this time he™d make sure they didn™t fail. He had a plan. \\n   The repaired alarm clock rang \\nat six o™clock the next morning. \\nHarry turned it off quickly and dressed silently. He mustn™t wake the Dursleys. \\nHe stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights.  \\n      He was going to wait for the postman on the \\ncorner of Privet Drive and get the letters for number \\nfour first. His heart hammered as he crept \\nacross the dark hall toward the front door Š \\n \\n      ﬁAAAAARRRGH!ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      Harry leapt into the air; he™d trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat Š \\nsomething \\nalive!  \\n      Lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the bi\\ng, squashy something had \\nbeen his uncle™s face. Uncle Vernon had been lyi\\nng at the foot of the front door in a sleeping \\nbag, clearly making sure that Harr\\ny didn™t do exactly what he™d been trying to do. He shouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea. Harry shuffled \\n\\nmiserably off into the kitchen and by the time he\\n got back, the mail had a\\nrrived, right into Uncle Vernon™s lap. Harry could see three letters addressed in green ink.  \\n      ﬁI want Šﬂ he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into pieces before his eyes.  \\n      Uncle Vernon didn™t go to work that day. He stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot. \\n       ﬁSee,ﬂ he explained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of \\nnails, ﬁif they can™t deliver them \\nthey™ll just give up.ﬂ        ﬁI™m not sure that™ll work, Vernon.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁOh, these people™s minds work in strange\\n ways, Petunia, they™re not like you and me,ﬂ said \\nUncle Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the pi\\nece of fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought \\nhim. \\n \\n  On Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived \\nfor Harry. As they couldn™t go through the mail slot \\nthey had been pushed under the door, slotted through the sides, and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroom. \\n \\n      Uncle Vernon stayed at home again. After \\nburning all the letters, he got out a hammer and nails \\nand boarded up the cracks around the front and back doors so no one could go out. He hummed \\nﬁTiptoe Through the Tulipsﬂ as he worked, and jumped at small noises. \\n\\n  On Saturday, things began to \\nget out of hand. Twenty-four letters to Harry found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused \\n\\nmilkman had handed Aunt Petunia through the \\nliving room window. While Uncle Vernon made \\nfurious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to, \\nAunt Petunia shredded the letters in her food processor.        ﬁWho on earth wants to talk to \\nyou this badly?ﬂ Dudley asked Harry in amazement. \\n   On Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the \\nbreakfast table looking tired and rather ill, but happy.  \\n      ﬁNo post on Sundays,ﬂ he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade on his newspapers, \\nﬁno damn letters today Šﬂ \\n \\n      Something came whizzing down the kitchen \\nchimney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the \\nback of the head. Next moment, \\nthirty or forty letters came pe\\nlting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one Š  \\n      ﬁOut! OUT!ﬂ \\n \\n      Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall. When Aunt Petunia and \\nDudley had run out with their arms over their faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They \\n\\ncould hear the letters still streaming into\\n the room, bouncing off the walls and floor.  \\n      ﬁThat does it,ﬂ said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but\\n pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time. ﬁI want you all back he\\nre in five minutes rea\\ndy to leave. We™re going away. Just pack some clothes. No arguments!ﬂ \\n \\n      He looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue. Ten minutes \\nlater they had wrenched their way through the boarded-up doors and were in the car, speeding toward the highway. Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his father had hit him round the head \\nfor holding them up while he tried to pack his te\\nlevision, VCR, and computer in his sports bag. \\n \\n      They drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn™t dare ask where they were going. Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while.  \\n      ﬁShake ™em off– shake ™em off,\\nﬂ he would mutter whenever he did this.  \\n      They didn™t stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall Dudley was howling. He™d never had such a bad day in his life. He was hungry, he™d missed five television programs he™d wanted to see, and \\n\\nhe™d never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computer. \\n \\n      Uncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy-looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city. Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin be\\nds and damp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but \\nHarry stayed awake, sitting on the windowsill, st\\naring down at the lights of passing cars and \\nwondering–   \\n They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned toma\\ntoes on toast for breakfast the next day. They had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their table. \\n       ﬁ™Scuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter?\\n Only I got about an ™undred of these at the front desk.ﬂ  \\n      She held up a letter so they could read the green ink address: \\n   Mr. H. Potter    Room 17 \\n\\n \\n Railview Hotel \\n\\n \\n  Cokeworth \\n    Harry made a grab for the letter but Uncl\\ne Vernon knocked his hand out of the way. The woman \\nstared.  \\n      ﬁI™ll take them,ﬂ said Uncle Vernon, st\\nanding up quickly and following her from the dining \\nroom. \\n \\n  ﬁWouldn™t it be better just to go home, dear?ﬂ \\nAunt Petunia suggested timidly, hours later, but \\nUncle Vernon didn™t seem to hear her. Exactly wh\\nat he was looking for, none of them knew. He drove them into the middle of a forest, got out\\n, looked around, shook his head, got back in the car, and off they went again. The same thing ha\\nppened in the middle of a plowed field, halfway \\n\\nacross a suspension bridge, and at the top of a multilevel parking garage.  \\n      ﬁDaddy™s gone mad, hasn™t he?ﬂ Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully la\\nte that afternoon. Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, and disappeared. \\n \\n      It started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dudley sniveled. \\n \\n      ﬁIt™s Monday,ﬂ he told his mother. ﬁThe Great Humberto™s on tonight. I want to stay somewhere \\nwith a television\\n.ﬂ  \\n      Monday. This reminded Harry of something. If it \\nwas Monday Š and you could usually count on Dudley to know the days the week, because of television Š then tomorrow, Tuesday, was \\n\\nHarry™s eleventh birthday. Of course, his birthdays were never exactly fun Š last year, the \\n\\nDursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair \\nof Uncle Vernon™s old socks. Still, you weren™t eleven every day. \\n \\n      Uncle Vernon was back and he was smili\\nng. He was also carrying a long, thin package and \\ndidn™t answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what he™d bought.  \\n      ﬁFound the perfect place!ﬂ he said. ﬁCome on! Everyone out!ﬂ \\n\\n       It was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way \\nout at sea. Perched on top of th\\ne rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine. One \\nthing was certain, there was no television in there. \\n       ﬁStorm forecast for tonight!ﬂ said Uncle \\nVernon gleefully, clapping his hands together. ﬁAnd this \\ngentleman™s kindly agreed to lend us his boat!ﬂ \\n \\n      A toothless old man came ambling up to them\\n, pointing, with a rather wicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron-gray water below them. \\n \\n      ﬁI™ve already got us some rati\\nons,ﬂ said Uncle Vernon, ﬁso all aboard!ﬂ  \\n      It was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spra\\ny and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind \\nwhipped their faces. After what seemed like hour\\ns they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, \\nslipping and sliding, led the way to the broken-down house.  \\n      The inside was horrible; it smelled strongly\\n of seaweed, the wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace was damp\\n and empty. There were only two rooms. \\n \\n      Uncle Vernon™s rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas. He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up. \\n \\n      ﬁCould do with some of those letters now, eh?ﬂ he said cheerfully. \\n\\n \\n      He was in a very good mood. Obvious\\nly he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them \\nhere in a storm to deliver mail. Harry privatel\\ny agreed, though the thought didn™t cheer him up at \\nall.  \\n      As night fell, the promised storm blew up \\naround them. Spray from the high waves splattered the \\nwalls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy windows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and made up a bed for Dudley on the moth-eaten sofa. She and \\n\\nUncle Vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door\\n, and Harry was left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket.  \\n      The storm raged more and more ferocious\\nly as the night went on. Harry couldn™t sleep. He shivered and turned over, trying to get comfortable, his stomach rumbling with hunger. Dudley™s \\nsnores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight\\n. The lighted dial of Dudley™s watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told Harry he™d be \\neleven in ten minutes™ time. He lay and watc\\nhed his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the Dursleys would remember at all, wonde\\nring where the letter writer was now.  \\n      Five minutes to go. Harry heard something \\ncreak outside. He hoped the roof wasn™t going to fall in, although he might be warmer if it did. Four minutes to go. Maybe the house in Privet Drive \\n\\nwould be so full of letters when they got back that he™d be able to steal one somehow. \\n \\n      Three minutes to go. Was that the sea, sla\\npping hard on the rock like that? And (two minutes to \\ngo) what was that funny crunching noise? \\nWas the rock crumbling into the sea? \\n       One minute to go and he™d be eleven. \\nThirty seconds– twenty– ten– nine Š maybe he™d \\nwake Dudley up, just to annoy him Š three– two– one–  \\n \\n      BOOM. \\n \\n      The whole shack shivered and Harry sat bol\\nt upright, staring at the door. Someone was outside, \\nknocking to come in. \\n \\n          \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n CHAPTER FOUR \\n  The Keeper of the Keys \\n \\n  BOOM. They knocked again. Dudley jerked awake. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁWhere™s the cannon?ﬂ he said stupidly. \\n\\n \\n      There was a crash behind them and Uncle \\nVernon came skidding into the room. He was holding \\na rifle in his hands Œ now they knew what had been in the long, thin package he had brought with them. \\n \\n      ﬁWho™s there?ﬂ he shouted. ﬁI warn you Š I™m armed!ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      There was a pause. Then Š \\n \\n      SMASH! \\n \\n      The door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and with a deafening crash \\nlanded flat on the floor.  \\n      A giant of a man was standing in the door\\nway. His face was almost completely hidden by a long, \\nshaggy mane of hair and a wild, tangled bear\\nd, but you could make out his eyes, glinting like \\nblack beetles under all the hair.        The giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so that his head just brushed the ceiling. He bent down, picked up the door, and fitted it easily back into its frame. The noise of the storm \\noutside dropped a little. He turned to look at them all.        ﬁCouldn™t make us a cup o™ tea, \\ncould yeh? It™s not been an easy journey–ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      He strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen with fear. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁBudge up, yeh great lump,ﬂ said the stranger. \\n\\n \\n      Dudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother, who was crouching, terrified, behind Uncle Vernon.  \\n      ﬁAn™ here™s Harry!ﬂ said the giant. \\n \\n      Harry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy \\nface and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile. \\n \\n      ﬁLas™ time I saw you, you was only a baby,ﬂ sa\\nid the giant. ﬁYeh look a lot like yer dad, but yeh™ve got yer mom™s eyes.ﬂ \\n      Uncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise. \\n \\n      ﬁI demand that you leave at once, \\nsir!ﬂ he said. ﬁYou are breaking and entering!ﬂ  \\n      ﬁAh, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,ﬂ said the giant; he reached over the back of the sofa, \\njerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon™s hands, bent it into a knot as \\neasily as if it had been made of \\nrubber, and threw it into a corner of the room. \\n \\n      Uncle Vernon made another f\\nunny noise, like a mouse being trodden on. \\n \\n      ﬁAnyway Š Harry,ﬂ said the giant, turning his back on the Dursleys, ﬁa very happy birthday to yeh. Got summat fer yeh here Š I mighta sat on it \\nat some point, but it\\n™ll taste all right.ﬂ \\n \\n      From an inside pocket of his black ove\\nrcoat he pulled a slightly squashed box. Harry opened it with trembling fingers. Inside was a \\nlarge, sticky chocolate cake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it in green icing.  \\n      Harry looked up at the giant. He meant to \\nsay thank you, but the words got lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead was, ﬁWho are you?ﬂ \\n \\n      The giant chuckled. \\n \\n      ﬁTrue, I haven™t introduced meself. Rubeus\\n Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.ﬂ  \\n      He held out an enormous hand and shook Harry™s whole arm. \\n\\n       ﬁWhat about that tea then, eh?ﬂ he said, r\\nubbing his hands together. ﬁI™d not say no ter summat \\nstronger if yeh™ve got it, mind.ﬂ \\n       His eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled \\nchip bags in it and he snorted. He bent down over the fireplace; they couldn™t see what he was doing but when he drew back a second later, \\nthere was a roaring fire there. It filled the whole damp hut with flickering \\nlight and Harry felt the warmth wash over him as though he™d sunk into a hot bath. \\n \\n      The giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged under his weight, and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat: a copper kettle, a squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, several chipped mugs, and a bottle of some\\n amber liquid that he took a swig from before \\nstarting to make tea. Soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage. Nobody \\nsaid a thing while the giant was working, but as he slid the first six fat, juicy, slightly burnt sausages from the poker, Dudley fidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon said sharply, ﬁDon™t touch anything he gives you, Dudley.ﬂ  \\n      The giant chuckled darkly. \\n \\n      ﬁYer great puddin™ of a son don™ need fattenin™ anymore, Dursley, don™ worry.ﬂ \\n       He passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted anything so wonderful, but he still couldn™t take his eyes off the giant. Finally, as nobody seemed about to explain \\nanything, he said, ﬁI™m sorry, but I \\nstill don™t really know who you are.ﬂ \\n       The giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.  \\n      ﬁCall me Hagrid,ﬂ he said, ﬁeveryone does. \\nAn™ like I told yeh, I™m Keep\\ner of Keys at Hogwarts Š yeh™ll know all about Hogwarts, o™ course.  \\n      ﬁEr Š no,ﬂ said Harry. \\n \\n      Hagrid looked shocked. \\n \\n      ﬁSorry,ﬂ Harry said quickly. \\n \\n      ﬁSorry?ﬂ barked Hagrid, turning to st\\nare at the Dursleys, who shrank \\nback into the shadows. ﬁIt™s \\nthem as should be sorry! I knew yeh weren™t gettin™ yer letters but I \\nnever thought yeh wouldn™t even know abou™ Hogwarts, fer cryin™ out loud! Did yeh never wonder where yer parents learned it all?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁAll what?ﬂ asked Harry. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁALL WHAT?ﬂ Hagrid thund\\nered. ﬁNow wait jus™ one second!ﬂ  \\n      He had leapt to his feet. In his anger \\nhe seemed to fill the whole hut. The Dursleys were \\ncowering against the wall. \\n \\n      ﬁDo you mean ter tell me,ﬂ he growled \\nat the Dursleys, ﬁthat this boy Š this boy! Š knows nothin™ abou™ Š about ANYTHING?ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to school, after all, and his marks weren™t \\nbad.  \\n      ﬁI know some things,ﬂ he said. ﬁI can, you know, do math and stuff.ﬂ \\n \\n      But Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, ﬁAbout \\nour world, I mean. \\nYour world. My world. Yer parents™ world.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁWhat world?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      Hagrid looked as if he was about to explode. \\n \\n      ﬁDURSLEY!ﬂ he boomed. \\n\\n \\n      Uncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something that sounded like \\nﬁMimblewimble.ﬂ Hagrid stared wildly at Harry. \\n      ﬁBut yeh must know about yer \\nmom and dad,ﬂ he said. ﬁI mean, they™re \\nfamous. You™re famous.ﬂ        ﬁWhat? My Š my mom and dad weren™t famous, were they?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁYeh don™ know– yeh don™ know–ﬂ Hagrid ran his fingers through his hair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare.  \\n      ﬁYeh don™ know what yeh are?ﬂ he said finally.  \\n      Uncle Vernon suddenly found his voice. \\n \\n      ﬁStop!ﬂ he commanded. ﬁStop right ther\\ne, sir! I forbid you to tell the boy anything!ﬂ  \\n      A braver man than Vernon Dursley would ha\\nve quailed under the furious look Hagrid now gave him; when Hagrid spoke, his ev\\nery syllable trembled with rage.  \\n      ﬁYou never told him? Neve\\nr told him what was in the letter Dumbledore left fer him? I was \\nthere! I saw Dumbledore leave it, Dursley! An™ \\nyou™ve kept it from \\nhim all these years?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁKept what from me?ﬂ said Harry eagerly. \\n \\n      ﬁSTOP! I FORBID YOU!ﬂ yelled Uncle Vernon in panic. \\n \\n      Aunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror. \\n       ﬁAh, go boil yer heads, both of yeh,ﬂ said Hagrid. ﬁHarry Š yer a wizard.ﬂ        There was silence inside the hut. Only the sea and the whistling wind could be heard. \\n \\n      ﬁI™m a \\nwhat?ﬂ gasped Harry. \\n \\n      ﬁA wizard, o™ course,ﬂ said Hagrid, sitting back down on the sofa, which groaned and sank even lower, ﬁan™ a thumpin™ good ‚un, I™d say, once yeh™ve\\n been trained up a bit. With a mum an™ dad \\nlike yours, what else would yeh be? An™ I r\\neckon it™s abou™ time yeh read yer letter.ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish envelope, addressed in emerald green to \\nMr. H. Potter, The Floor, Hut-on-the-Rock, The Sea. He pulled out the letter and read:  \\n    HOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY      Headmaster: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE \\n\\n   \\n\\n (Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., \\nChf. Warlock, Supreme Mugwump, International Confed. of Wizards) \\n   \\n Dear Mr. Potter,    We are pleased to inform you that you have \\nbeen accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft \\nand Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment.  \\n  Term begins on September 1. We awa\\nit your owl by no later than July 31. \\n \\n  Yours sincerely, \\n\\n \\n  Minerva McGonagall, \\n\\n \\n  Deputy Headmistress \\n     Questions exploded inside Harry™s head like fi\\nreworks and he couldn™t decide which to ask first. After a few minutes he stammered, ﬁWha\\nt does it mean, they await my owl?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁGallopin™ Gorgons, that reminds me,ﬂ said\\n Hagrid, clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from yet a\\nnother pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl Š a real, live, rather ruffled-looking owl Š a long quill, and a roll of parchment. With his \\n\\ntongue between his teeth he scribbled a \\nnote that Harry could read upside down:    Dear Professor Dumbledore,  \\n  Given Harry his letter. \\n\\n \\n  Taking him to buy his things tomorrow. \\n   Weather™s horrible. Hope you™re well. \\n\\n \\n  Hagrid \\n   Hagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl,\\n which clamped it in its beak, went to the door, and \\nthrew the owl out into the storm. Then he came back and sat down as though this was as normal \\n\\nas talking on the telephone.  \\n      Harry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁWhere was I?ﬂ said Hagrid, but at th\\nat moment, Uncle Vernon, still ashen-faced but looking \\nvery angry, moved into the firelight.  \\n      ﬁHe™s not going,ﬂ he said. \\n \\n      Hagrid grunted. \\n \\n      ﬁI™d like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him,ﬂ he said. \\n       ﬁA what?ﬂ \\nsaid Harry, interested. \\n       ﬁA Muggle,ﬂ said Hagrid, ﬁit™s what we call nonmagic folk like them. An™ it™s your bad luck you \\ngrew up in a family o™ the biggest\\n Muggles I ever laid eyes on.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁWe swore when we took him in we™d put \\na stop to that rubbish,ﬂ said Uncle Vernon, ﬁswore we™d stamp it out of him! Wizard indeed!ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁYou knew?ﬂ said Harry. ﬁYou \\nknew I™m a Š a wizard?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁKnew!ﬂ shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly. ﬁKnew\\n! Of course we knew! How could you not be, my dratted sister being what she was? Oh, she got a letter just \\nlike that and disappeared off to that Š that school Š and came home every vacation with he\\nr pockets full of frog spawn, turning teacups into rats. I was the only one who saw her for what she was Š a freak! But for my mother \\nand father, oh no, it was Lily this and Lily that, they were proud of having a witch in the family!ﬂ \\n \\n      She stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on. It seemed she had been wanting to \\nsay all this for years.  \\n      ﬁThen she met that Potter at school and th\\ney left and got married and had you, and of course I \\nknew you™d be just the same, just\\n as strange, just as Š as Šabnormal Š and then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up and we got landed with you!ﬂ  \\n      Harry had gone very white. As soon as he found his voice he said, ﬁBlown up? You told me they \\ndied in a car crash!ﬂ        ﬁCAR CRASH!ﬂ roared Hagrid, jumping up so \\nangrily that the Dursleys scuttled back to their corner. ﬁHow could a car crash ki\\nll Lily an™ James Potter? It™s\\n an outrage! A scandal! Harry Potter not knowin™ his own story when every kid in our world knows his name!ﬂ \\n       ﬁBut why? What happened?ﬂ Harry asked urgently. \\n\\n \\n      The anger faded from Hagrid™s face. He looked suddenly anxious. \\n \\n      ﬁI never expected this,ﬂ he said, in a low, worried voice. ﬁI had no idea, when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin™ hold of \\nyeh, how much yeh didn™t know. Ah, Harry, I don™ \\nknow if I™m the right person ter tell yeh Š but \\nsomeone™s gotta Š yeh can™t go off ter Hogwarts \\nnot knowin™.ﬂ  \\n      He threw a dirty look at the Dursleys. \\n \\n      ﬁWell, it™s best yeh know as much as I \\ncan tell yeh Š mind, I can™t te\\nll yeh everythin™, it™s a great myst™ry, parts of it–ﬂ \\n \\n      He sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds, and then said, ﬁIt begins, I suppose, with Š with a person called Š but it™s incredible yeh don™t know his name, everyone in our world \\nknows Šﬂ        ﬁWho?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁWell Š I don™ like sayin™ th\\ne name if I can help it. No one does.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁWhy not?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁGulpin™ gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared. Blimey, this is difficult. See, there was this \\nwizard who went– bad. As bad as you could go. Worse. Worse than worse. His name was–ﬂ \\n \\n      Hagrid gulped, but no words came out. \\n \\n      ﬁCould you write it down?ﬂ Harry suggested. \\n \\n      ﬁNah Š can™t spell it. All right Š\\nVoldemort. ﬂ Hagrid shuddered. ﬁDon™ make me say it again. \\nAnyway, this Š this wizard, about twenty years ago now, started lookin™ fer followers. Got ‚em, \\ntoo Š some were afraid, some just wanted a b\\nit o™ his power, ‚cause he was gettin™ himself \\npower, all right. Dark days, Harry. Didn™t know who ter trust, didn™t dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches– terrible things happened. He was takin™ over. ‚Course, some stood \\nup to him Š an™ he killed ‚em. Horribly. One o™ \\nthe only safe places left was Hogwarts. Reckon Dumbledore™s the only one You-K\\nnow-Who was afraid of. Didn™t da\\nre try takin™ the school, not jus™ then, anyway.  \\n      ﬁNow, yer mum an™ dad were as good a witch \\nan™ wizard as I ever knew. Head boy an™ girl at Hogwarts in their day! Suppose \\nthe myst™ry is why You-Know-Who \\nnever tried to get ‚em on his \\nside before– probably knew they were too close ter Dumbledore te\\nr want anythin™ ter do with the Dark Side.  \\n      ﬁMaybe he thought he could persuade ‚em– maybe he just wanted ‚em outta the way. All \\nanyone knows is, he turned up in the village where you was all living, on Halloween ten years ago. You was just a year old. He came ter yer house an™ Š an™ Šﬂ  \\n      Hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted handkerchief and blew his nose with a sound like a foghorn.  \\n      ﬁSorry,ﬂ he said. ﬁBut it™s that sad Š knew yer mum an™ dad, an™ nicer people yeh couldn™t find \\nŠ anywa–   \\n      ﬁYou-Know-Who killed ‚em. An™ then Š an™ this\\n is the real myst™ry of the thing Š he tried to \\nkill you, too. Wanted ter make a clean job of it, I \\nsuppose, or maybe he just liked killin™ by then. \\nBut he couldn™t do it. Never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead? That was no \\nordinary cut. That™s what yeh get when a powerful, evil curse touches yeh Š took care of yer mum an™ dad an™ yer house, even Š but it didn™\\nt work on you, an™ that™s why yer famous, Harry. \\nNo one ever lived after he deci\\nded ter kill ™em, no one except you, \\nan™ he™d killed some o™ the best witches an™ wizards of the age Š the McKinnons, the Bones, the Prewetts Š an™ you was only a baby, an™ you lived.ﬂ        Something very painful was going on in Harr\\ny™s mind. As Hagrid™s story came to a close, he saw \\nagain the blinding flash of green light, more clearly than he had ever remembered it before Š \\n\\nand he remembered something else, for the firs\\nt time in his life: a \\nhigh, cold, cruel laugh.  \\n      Hagrid was watching him sadly. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁTook yeh from the ruined house myself, on\\n Dumbledore™s orders. Brought\\n yeh ter this lot– .ﬂ  \\n      ﬁLoad of old tosh,ﬂ said Uncle Vernon. Harry\\n jumped; he had almost forgotten that the Dursleys \\nwere there. Uncle Vernon certainly seemed to ha\\nve got back his courage. He was glaring at Hagrid and his fists were clenched.  \\n      ﬁNow, you listen here, boy,ﬂ he snarled, ﬁI accept there™s something \\nstrange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldn™t have cured Š and as for all this about your parents, well, they were weirdoes, no denying it, and the world™s better off without them in my opinion Š asked for \\n\\nall they got, getting mixed up w\\nith these wizarding types Š just what I expected, always knew they™d come to a sticky end Šﬂ \\n \\n      But at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the so\\nfa and drew a battered pink umbrella from inside his \\ncoat. Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like a sword, he said, ﬁI™m warning you, Dursley Š I™m \\nwarning you Š one more word–ﬂ \\n \\n      In danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant, Uncle Vernon™s courage failed again; he \\nflattened himself against the wall and fell silent. \\n \\n      ﬁThat™s better,ﬂ said Hagrid, breathing heavily and sitting back down on the sofa, which this time \\nsagged right down to the floor.  \\n      Harry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, hundreds of them. \\n \\n      ﬁBut what happened to Vol-, sorry Š I mean, You-Know-Who?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁGood question, Harry. Disappeared. Vanished. Same night he tried ter kill you. Makes yeh even \\nmore famous. That™s the biggest myst™ry, see– \\nhe was gettin™ more an™ more powerful Š why™d \\nhe go? \\n \\n      ﬁSome say he died. Codswallop, in my opi\\nnion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to \\ndie. Some say he™s still out there, bidin™ his \\ntime, like, but I don™ be\\nlieve it. People who was on his side came back ter ours. Some of ‚em came \\noutta kinda trances. Don™ reckon they could™ve done if he was comin™ back. \\n \\n      ﬁMost of us reckon he™s still out there somewhere but lost his powers. Too weak to carry on. \\n™Cause somethin™ about you finished him, Harry. There was somethin™ goin™ on that night he \\n\\nhadn™t counted on Š I dunno what it was, no one does Š but somethin™ about you stumped him, \\nall right.ﬂ        Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and re\\nspect blazing in his eyes, but Harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake. A wi\\nzard? Him? How could \\nhe possibly be? He™d spent his \\nlife being clouted by Dudley, and bullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon; if he was really a wizard, why hadn™t they been turned into warty toads every \\ntime they™d tried to lock him in his cupboard? If \\nhe™d once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world, how come Dudley had always been \\nable to kick him around like a football? \\n \\n      ﬁHagrid,ﬂ he said quietly, ﬁI think you mu\\nst have made a mistake. I don™t think I can be a \\nwizard.ﬂ  \\n      To his surprise, Hagrid chuckled. \\n \\n      ﬁNot a wizard, eh? Never made th\\nings happen when you was scared or angry?ﬂ  \\n      Harry looked into the fire. Now he came to \\nthink about it– every odd thing that had ever made \\nhis aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when he, Ha\\nrry, had been upset or angry– chased by Dudley™s gang, he had somehow foun\\nd himself out of their reach– dreading going to \\nschool with that ridiculous haircut, he™d managed to make it grow back– and the very last time \\n\\nDudley had hit him, hadn™t he got his revenge, w\\nithout even realizing he was doing it? Hadn™t he \\nset a boa constrictor on him? \\n \\n      Harry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and \\nsaw that Hagrid was positively beaming at him. \\n \\n      ﬁSee?ﬂ said Hagrid. ﬁHarry Potter, \\nnot a wizard Š you wait, you™ll be right famous at \\nHogwarts.ﬂ  \\n      But Uncle Vernon wasn™t going to give in without a fight.  \\n      ﬁHaven™t I told you he™s not going?ﬂ he\\n hissed. ﬁHe™s going to Stonewall High and he™ll be grateful for it. I™ve read those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbish Š spell books and wands and Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁIf he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won™t stop him,ﬂ growled Hagrid. ﬁStop Lily an™ \\nJames Potter™s son goin™ ter Hogwarts! Yer mad. \\nHis name™s been down ever since he was born. \\nHe™s off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world. Se\\nven years there and he won™t know himself. He™ll be with youngsters of\\n his own sort, fer a change, an™ he™ll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwar\\nts ever had Albus DumbledŠﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁI AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL TO TEACH HIM MAGIC \\nTRICKS!ﬂ yelled Uncle Vernon.  \\n      But he had finally gone too far. Hagrid seized his umbrella a\\nnd whirled it over his head, ﬁNEVER Šﬂ he thundered, ﬁŠ INSULT Š ALBUS Š DUMBLEDORE Š IN Š FRONT Š OF Š ME!ﬂ       He brought the umbrella swishing down through \\nthe air to point at Dudley Š there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling in pain. When he turned his back \\non them, Harry saw a curly pig™s tail poking through a hole in his trousers. \\n       Uncle Vernon roared. Pulling Aunt Petunia \\nand Dudley into the other room, he cast one last \\nterrified look at Hagrid and slammed the door behind them. \\n \\n      Hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard. \\n \\n      ﬁShouldn™ta lost me temper,ﬂ he said rueful\\nly, ﬁbut it didn™t work anyway. Meant ter turn him \\ninto a pig, but I suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there wasn™t much left ter do.ﬂ  \\n      He cast a sideways look at Harry under his bushy eyebrows. \\n \\n      ﬁBe grateful if yeh didn™t mention that \\nter anyone at Hogwarts,ﬂ he said. ﬁI™m Š er Š not \\nsupposed ter do magic, strictly speakin™. I was \\nallowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh an™ get yer letters to yeh an™ stuff Š one o™ the reasons I was so keen ter take on the job.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁWhy aren™t you supposed to do magic?ﬂ asked Harry. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁOh, well Š I was at Hogwarts meself but I \\nŠ er Š got expelled, ter tell yeh the truth. In me \\nthird year. They snapped me wand in half an\\n™ everything. But Dumbledore let me stay on as \\ngamekeeper. Great man, Dumbledore.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWhy were you expelled?ﬂ \\n       ﬁIt™s gettin™ late and we™ve got lots ter do tomorrow,ﬂ said Hagrid loudly. ﬁGotta get up ter town, \\nget all yer books an™ that.ﬂ  \\n      He took off his thick black coat and threw it to Harry.  \\n      ﬁYou can kip under that,ﬂ he said. ﬁDon™ mind \\nif it wriggles a bit, I think I still got a couple o™ doormice in one o™ the pockets.ﬂ \\n \\n          \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n CHAPTER FIVE \\n  Diagon Alley  \\n    Harry woke early the next morning. Although he \\ncould tell it was daylight, he kept his eyes shut tight.  \\n      It was a dream, he told himself firmly. \\nI dreamed a giant called Hagrid came to tell me I was going to a school for wizards. When I open my eyes I™ll be at home in my cupboard.        There was suddenly a loud tapping noise. \\n \\n      And there™s Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, Harry thought, his heart sinking. But he still didn™t open his eyes. It had been such a good dream. \\n \\n      Tap. Tap. Tap. \\n \\n      ﬁAll right,ﬂ Harry mumbled, ﬁI™m getting up.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      He sat up and Hagrid™s heavy coat fell off him. The hut was full of sunlight, the storm was over, \\nHagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa\\n, and there was an owl rapping its claw on the \\nwindow, a newspaper held in its beak.  \\n      Harry scrambled to his feet, so happy he \\nfelt as though a large balloon was swelling inside him. \\nHe went straight to the window and jerked\\n it open. The owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid, who didn™t wake up. The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack Hagrid™s coat.  \\n      ﬁDon™t do that.ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on \\nsavaging the coat.  \\n      ﬁHagrid!ﬂ said Harry loudly. ﬁThere™s an owl Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁPay him,ﬂ Hagrid grunted into the sofa. \\n \\n      ﬁWhat?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁHe wants payin™ fer deliverin™ the paper. Look in the pockets.ﬂ  \\n      Hagrid™s coat seemed to be made of nothing \\nbut pockets Š bunches of keys, slug pellets, balls of string, peppermint humbugs, teab\\nags– finally, Harry pulled out a handful of strange-looking coins.  \\n      ﬁGive him five Knuts,ﬂ said Hagrid sleepily.       ﬁKnuts?ﬂ  \\n      ﬁThe little bronze ones.ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl held out his leg so Harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it.\\n Then he flew off through the open window.  \\n      Hagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched. \\n \\n      ﬁBest be off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter London an™ buy all yer stuff fer school.ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them. He had ju\\nst thought of something \\nthat made him feel as though the happy \\nballoon inside him had got a puncture. \\n \\n      ﬁUm Š Hagrid?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁMm?ﬂ said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge boots. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁI haven™t got any money Š and you heard Uncle Vernon last night– he won™t pay for me to go \\nand learn magic.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁDon™t worry about that,ﬂ said Hagrid, standing up and scra\\ntching his head. ﬁD™yeh think yer parents didn™t leave yeh anything?ﬂ  \\n      ﬁBut if their house was destroyed Šﬂ \\n\\n       ﬁThey didn™ keep their gold in the house, boy! Nah, first stop fer us is Gringotts. Wizards™ bank. \\nHave a sausage, they™re not bad cold Š an™ I wouldn™ say no teh a bit o™ yer birthday cake, neither.ﬂ        ﬁWizards have \\nbanks?ﬂ  \\n      ﬁJust the one. Gringotts. Run by goblins.ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding. \\n \\n      ﬁGoblins?ﬂ  \\n      ﬁYeah Š so yeh™d be mad ter try an™ rob \\nit, I™ll tell yeh that. Never mess with goblins, Harry. \\nGringotts is the safest place in the world fer \\nanything yeh want ter keep safe Š ‚cept maybe \\nHogwarts. As a matter o™ fact\\n, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway. Fer Dumbledore. Hogwarts \\nbusiness.ﬂ Hagrid drew himself up proudly. ﬁHe usua\\nlly gets me ter do important stuff fer him. \\nFetchin™ you Š gettin™ things from Gr\\ningotts Š knows he can trust me, see.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁGot everythin™? Come on, then.ﬂ \\n\\n       Harry followed Hagrid out onto the rock. The sky was quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the \\nsunlight. The boat Uncle Vernon had hired was still th\\nere, with a lot of water in the bottom after \\nthe storm. \\n       ﬁHow did you get here?ﬂ Harr\\ny asked, looking around for another boat. \\n \\n      ﬁFlew,ﬂ said Hagrid. \\n \\n      ﬁFlew?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁYeah Š but we™ll go back in this. Not s™pposed ter use magic now I™ve got yeh.ﬂ \\n \\n      They settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at Hagrid, trying to imagine him flying. \\n \\n      ﬁSeems a shame ter row, though,ﬂ said Hagri\\nd, giving Harry another of his sideways looks. ﬁIf I was ter Š er Š speed things up a bit, would yeh mind not mentionin™ it at Hogwarts?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁOf course not,ﬂ said Harry, eager to see more magic. Hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again, \\ntapped it twice on the side of the boat, and they sped off toward land.  \\n      ﬁWhy would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?ﬂ Harry asked. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁSpells Š enchantments,ﬂ said Hagrid, unf\\nolding his newspaper as he spoke. ﬁThey say there™s \\ndragons guardin™ the high security vaults. And then yeh gotta find yer way Š Gringotts is hundreds of miles under London, see. Deep under \\nthe Underground. Yeh™d die of hunger tryin™ ter get out, even if yeh did mana\\nge ter get yer hands on summat.ﬂ  \\n      Harry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his newspaper, the Daily Prophet. Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to be left alone while they did this, but it was very difficult, he™d never had so many questions in his life. \\n \\n      ﬁMinistry o™ Magic messin™ things \\nup as usual,ﬂ Hagrid muttered, turning the page.  \\n      ﬁThere™s a Ministry of Magic?ﬂ \\nHarry asked, before he could stop himself. \\n \\n      ﬁ™Course,ﬂ said Hagrid. ﬁThey wanted Dumb\\nledore fer Minister, o™ course, but he™d never leave \\nHogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the job. Bungler if ever there was one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every morning, askin™ fer advice.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁBut what does a Ministry of Magic do?ﬂ  \\n      ﬁWell, their main job is to keep it from \\nthe Muggles that there™s still witches an™ wizards up an™ down the country.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁWhy?ﬂ \\n\\n       ﬁWhy? Blimey, Harry, everyone™d be wantin™ magic so\\nlutions to their problems. Nah, we™re best \\nleft alone.ﬂ         At this moment the boat bumped gently into\\n the harbor wall. Hagrid folded up his newspaper, and they clambered up the stone steps onto the street.  \\n      Passersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town to the station. Harry couldn™t blame them. Not only was Hagrid twice \\nas tall as anyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters \\nand saying loudly, ﬁSee that, Harry? Things these \\nMuggles dream up, eh?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁHagrid,ﬂ said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, ﬁdid you say there are dragons at Gringotts?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWell, so they say,ﬂ said\\n Hagrid. ﬁCrikey, I™d like a dragon.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁYou™d like one?ﬂ  \\n      ﬁWanted one ever since I was a kid Š here we go.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      They had reached the station. There was a \\ntrain to London in five minutes™ time. Hagrid, who \\ndidn™t understand ﬁMuggle money,ﬂ as he called it, \\ngave the bills to Harry so he could buy their tickets. \\n \\n      People stared more than ever on the train. \\nHagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a canary-yellow circus tent.  \\n      ﬁStill got yer letter, Harry?ﬂ he asked \\nas he counted stitches.  \\n      Harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁGood,ﬂ said Hagrid. ﬁThere™s a list there of everything yeh need.ﬂ  \\n      Harry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn™t noticed the night before, and read: \\n\\n   HOGWARTS  SCHOOL of  WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY    UNIFORM \\n\\n \\n First-year students will require: \\n\\n \\n  1.

Alt\\nhough Hagrid seemed to know where he was going, \\nhe was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground, and complained loudly that the \\nseats were too small and the trains too slow. \\n       ﬁI don™t know how the Muggles manage without magic,ﬂ he said as they climbed a broken-down \\nescalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shops.  \\n      Hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all Harry had to do was keep close behind him. They passed book shops and music stores, ha\\nmburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere \\nthat looked as if it could sell you a magic wand. This was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people. Could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath th\\nem? Were there really \\nshops that sold spell books and broomsticks? Might this not al\\nl be some huge joke that the \\nDursleys had cooked up? If Harry hadn™t known th\\nat the Dursleys had no sense of humor, he might have thought so; yet somehow, even though \\neverything Hagrid had told him so far was \\nunbelievable, Harry couldn™t help trusting him. \\n \\n      ﬁThis is it,ﬂ said Hagrid, coming to \\na halt, ﬁthe Leaky Cauldron. It™s a famous place.ﬂ \\n \\n      It was a tiny, grubby-looking pub. If Hagrid hadn™t pointed it out, Harry wouldn™t have noticed it was there. The people hurrying by didn™t glance at \\nit. Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldn™t see the Leaky Cauldron at all. In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he\\n and Hagrid could see it. Before he could mention this, Hagrid had steered him inside. \\n \\n      For a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A few old women we\\nre sitting in a corner, \\ndrinking tiny glasses of sherry. One of them was smoking a long pipe. A little man in a top hat \\nwas talking to the old bartender, who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut. The low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in. Everyone seemed to know Hagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the bartender reached fo\\nr a glass, saying, ﬁThe usual, Hagrid?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁCan™t, Tom, I™m on Hogwarts business,\\nﬂ said Hagrid, clapping his great hand on Harry™s shoulder and making Harry™s knees buckle. \\n \\n      ﬁGood Lord,ﬂ said the bartender, peering at Harry, ﬁis this Š can this be Š?ﬂ \\n \\n      The Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent.  \\n      ﬁBless my soul,ﬂ whispered the old bartender, ﬁHarry Potter– what an honor.ﬂ  \\n      He hurried out from behind the bar, rushed\\n toward Harry and seized his hand, tears in his eyes.  \\n      ﬁWelcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      Harry didn™t know what to say. Everyone was looking at him. The old \\nwoman with the pipe was \\npuffing on it without realizing it had gone out. Hagrid was beaming. \\n \\n      Then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment, Harry found himself shaking \\nhands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron.        ﬁDoris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can™t believe I™m meeting you at last.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁSo proud, Mr. Potter, I™m just so proud.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁAlways wanted to shake your hand Š I™m all of a flutter.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁDelighted, Mr. Potter, just can™t tell you, Diggle™s the name, Dedalus Diggle.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁI™ve seen you before!ﬂ said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle™s top hat fell off in his excitement. ﬁYou \\nbowed to me once in a shop.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁHe remembers!ﬂ cried Dedalus Diggle, \\nlooking around at everyone. ﬁDid you hear that? He \\nremembers me!ﬂ Harry shook hands again and again Š Doris Crockford kept coming back for \\n\\nmore.  \\n      A pale young man made his way forward, \\nvery nervously. One of his eyes was twitching. \\n \\n      ﬁProfessor Quirrell!ﬂ said Hagrid. ﬁHarr\\ny, Professor Quirrell will be\\n one of your teachers at \\nHogwarts.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁP-P-Potter,ﬂ stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry™s hand, \\nﬁc-can™t t-tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWhat sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?ﬂ \\n       ﬁD-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,ﬂ muttered Professor Quirrell, \\nas though he™d rather not think about it. ﬁN-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?ﬂ He laughed nervously. ﬁYou™ll be g-\\ngetting all your equipment, I suppose? I™ve \\ng-got to p-pick up a new b-book on vampires, m-\\nmyself.ﬂ He looked terrified at the very thought.  \\n      But the others wouldn™t let Professor Quirre\\nll keep Harry to himself. It took almost ten minutes \\nto get away from them all. At last, Hagrid \\nmanaged to make himself heard over the babble. \\n \\n      ﬁMust get on Š lots ter buy. Come on, Harry.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      Doris Crockford shook Harry™s hand one last time, and Hagrid led them through the bar and out \\ninto a small, walled courtyard, where there wa\\ns nothing but a trash can and a few weeds. \\n \\n      Hagrid grinned at Harry. \\n \\n      ﬁTold yeh, didn™t I? Told yeh you was famo\\nus. Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin™ ter meet \\nyeh Š mind you, he™s usually tremblin™.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁIs he always that nervous?ﬂ \\n      ﬁOh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine while he was studyin™\\n outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experien\\nce– They say he met vampires in the Black \\nForest, and there was a nasty bit o™ trouble with a hag Š never been the same since. Scared of \\nthe students, scared of his own subject Š now, where™s me umbrella?ﬂ \\n       Vampires? Hags? Harry™s head was swimmi\\nng. Hagrid, meanwhile, was \\ncounting bricks in the wall above the trash can.  \\n      ﬁThree up– two across–ﬂ he muttered. ﬁRight, stand back, Harry.ﬂ  \\n      He tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella. \\n \\n      The brick he had touched quivered Š it wriggled Š in the middle, a small hole appeared Š it \\ngrew wider and wider Š a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for \\nHagrid, an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight.  \\n      ﬁWelcome,ﬂ said Hagrid, ﬁto Diagon Alley.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      He grinned at Harry™s amazement. They \\nstepped through the archway. Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall.  \\n      The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop. Cauldrons Š All Sizes Š Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver Š Self-Stirring Š Collapsible, said a sign hanging over them. \\n \\n      ﬁYeah, you™ll be needin™ one,ﬂ said Hagrid, ﬁbut we gotta get yer money first.ﬂ \\n\\n       Harry wished he had about eight more eyes. He turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at once: the shops, the things outside them, the people \\ndoing their shopping. A plump woma\\nn outside an Apothecary was shaking her head as they \\npassed, saying, ﬁDragon liver, sixteen Sickles an ounce, they™re mad–ﬂ \\n       A low, soft hooting came from a dark\\n shop with a sign saying Eeylops Owl Emporium Š \\nTawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys of about Harry™s age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it\\n. ﬁLook,ﬂ Harry heard one of them say, ﬁthe new \\nNimbus Two Thousand Š fastest ever Šﬂ Ther\\ne were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels™ eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, \\npotion bottles, globes of the moon–  \\n \\n      ﬁGringotts,ﬂ said Hagrid. \\n \\n      They had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shops. Standing \\nbeside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold, was Š \\n \\n      ﬁYeah, that™s a goblin,ﬂ said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward him. The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry. He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard \\nand, Harry noticed, very long fingers and feet. He bowed as they walked inside. Now they were facing a second pair of doors, silver this time, with words engraved upon them: \\n   Enter, stranger, but take heed    Of what awaits the sin of greed, \\n\\n \\n  For those who take, but do not earn, \\n\\n \\n  Must pay most dearly in their turn. \\n\\n \\n  So if you seek beneath our floors \\n\\n \\n A treasure that was never yours, \\n\\n \\n  Thief, you have been warned, beware \\n\\n \\n  Of finding more than treasure there. \\n     ﬁLike I said, Yeh™d be mad \\nter try an™ rob it,ﬂ said Hagrid.  \\n      A pair of goblins bowed them through the silv\\ner doors and they were in a vast marble hall. About \\na hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in brass scales, examin\\ning precious stones through eyeglasses. There \\nwere too many doors to count leading off the hall,\\n and yet more goblins were showing people in \\n\\nand out of these. Hagrid and Harry made for the counter.  \\n      ﬁMorning,ﬂ said Hagrid to a free goblin. ﬁWe™ve come ter take some money outta Mr. Harry \\nPotter™s safe.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁYou have his key, sir?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁGot it here somewhere,ﬂ said Hagrid, a\\nnd he started emptying his pockets onto the counter, \\nscattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblin™s book of numbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile \\nof rubies as big as glowing coals.  \\n      ﬁGot it,ﬂ said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key.  \\n      The goblin looked at it closely. \\n \\n      ﬁThat seems to be in order.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁAn™ I™ve also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore,ﬂ said Hagrid importantly, throwing \\nout his chest. ﬁIt™s about the You-Know-W\\nhat in vault seven hundred and thirteen.ﬂ        The goblin read the letter carefully.  \\n      ﬁVery well,ﬂ he said, handing it back to Hagrid, ﬁI will have someone take you down to both \\nvaults. Griphook!ﬂ  \\n      Griphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his \\npockets, he and Harry followed Griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall.  \\n      ﬁWhat™s the You-Know-What in va\\nult seven hundred and thirteen?ﬂ Harry asked.  \\n      ﬁCan™t tell yeh that,ﬂ said Hagrid myster\\niously. ﬁVery secret. Hogwarts business. Dumbledore™s \\ntrusted me. More™n my job™s worth ter tell yeh that.ﬂ \\n \\n      Griphook held the door open for them. Ha\\nrry, who had expected more marble, was surprised. \\nThey were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches. It sloped steeply downward \\n\\nand there were little railway tracks on the floor. Griphook whistled and a small cart came \\nhurtling up the tracks toward them. They climbed \\nin Š Hagrid with some difficulty Š and were \\noff.  \\n      At first they just hurtled through a maze \\nof twisting passages. Harry tried to remember, left, \\nright, right, left, middle fork, ri\\nght, left, but it was impossible. \\nThe rattling cart seemed to know \\nits own way, because Griphook wasn™t steering.  \\n      Harry™s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them wide open. Once, he \\nthought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late Š they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor. \\n \\n      ﬁI never know,ﬂ Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart, ﬁwhat™s the difference between \\na stalagmite and a stalactite?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁStalagmite™s got an ‚m™ in it,ﬂ said Hagr\\nid. ﬁAn™ don™ ask me questions just now, I think I™m \\ngonna be sick.ﬂ  \\n      He did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall, \\nHagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from trembling. \\n \\n      Griphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came billowing out, and as it cleared, Harry \\ngasped. Inside were mounds of gold coins. Columns of silver. Heaps of\\n little bronze Knuts. \\n \\n      ﬁAll yours,ﬂ smiled Hagrid. \\n\\n \\n      All Harry™s Š it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn™t have known about this or they™d have had it from him faster than blinking. How often ha\\nd they complained how much Harry cost them \\nto keep? And all the time ther\\ne had been a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under \\nLondon.       Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag. \\n \\n      ﬁThe gold ones are Galleons,ﬂ he explained. \\nﬁSeventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-\\nnine Knuts to a Sickle, it™s easy enough. Right, that should be enough fer a couple o™ terms, we™ll \\nkeep the rest safe for yeh.ﬂ He turned to Griphook. ﬁVault seven hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more slowly?ﬂ  \\n      ﬁOne speed only,ﬂ said Griphook. \\n \\n      They were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air became co\\nlder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. They went rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and pulled him \\nback by the scruff of his neck.  \\n      Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole. \\n \\n      ﬁStand back,ﬂ said Griphook importantly. He \\nstroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away. \\n \\n      ﬁIf anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they™d be sucked through the door and trapped in there,ﬂ said Griphook.  \\n      ﬁHow often do you check to see if anyone™s inside?ﬂ Harry asked. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁAbout once every ten years,ﬂ said Griphook with a rather nasty grin.        Something really extraordinary had to be in\\nside this top security vault, Harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous \\njewels at the very least Š but at first he thought it was empty. Then he noticed a grubby lit\\ntle package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor. Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry longed to know what it was, but knew better than to ask.        ﬁCome on, back in this infernal cart, and don™t\\n talk to me on the way bac\\nk, it™s best if I keep me \\nmouth shut,ﬂ said Hagrid.  \\n  One wild cart ride later they stood blinking in \\nthe sunlight outside Gringotts. Harry didn™t know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money. He didn™t have to know how many \\nGalleons there were to a pound to know that he was holding more money than he™d had in his \\nwhole life Š more money than even Dudley had ever had. \\n \\n      ﬁMight as well get yer uniform,ﬂ said \\nHagrid, nodding toward Madam Malkin™s Robes for All Occasions. ﬁListen, Harry, would yeh mind if I \\nslipped off fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky \\nCauldron? I hate them Gringotts carts.ﬂ He di\\nd still look a bit sick, so Harry entered Madam \\nMalkin™s shop alone, feeling nervous.  \\n      Madam Malkin was a squat,\\n smiling witch dressed all in mauve. \\n      ﬁHogwarts, dear?ﬂ she said, when Harry \\nstarted to speak. ﬁGot the lot here Š another young man being fitted up just now, in fact.ﬂ \\n       In the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was standing on a footstool while a \\nsecond witch pinned up his long black robes. Madam Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him \\n\\nslipped a long robe over his head, and began to pin it to the right length.  \\n      ﬁHello,ﬂ said the boy, ﬁHogwarts, too?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁYes,ﬂ said Harry. \\n \\n      ﬁMy father™s next door buying my books and mother™s up the street looking at wands,ﬂ said the \\nboy. He had a bored, drawling voice. ﬁThen I™m going \\nto drag them off to look at racing brooms. \\nI don™t see why first years can™t have their own. I think I™ll bully father into getting me one and \\nI™ll smuggle it in somehow.ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁHave you got your own broom?ﬂ the boy went on. \\n \\n      ﬁNo,ﬂ said Harry. \\n \\n      ﬁPlay Quidditch at all?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁNo,ﬂ Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be. \\n       ﬁI do Š Father says it™s a crime if I™m not picked to play for my house, and I must say, I agree. \\nKnow what house you™ll be in yet?ﬂ        ﬁNo,ﬂ said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁWell, no one really know\\ns until they get there, do they, but I \\nknow I™ll be in Slytherin, all our \\nfamily have been Š imagine being in Huff\\nlepuff, I think I™d leave, wouldn™t you?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁMmm,ﬂ said Harry, wishing he could say something a bit more interesting. \\n \\n      ﬁI say, look at that man!ﬂ said the boy \\nsuddenly, nodding toward the front window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldn™t come \\nin.  \\n      ﬁThat™s Hagrid,ﬂ said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn™t. ﬁHe works at \\nHogwarts.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁOh,ﬂ said the boy, ﬁI™ve heard of him. He™s a sort of servant, isn™t he?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁHe™s the gamekeeper,ﬂ said Harry. He was liking the boy le\\nss and less every second.       ﬁYes, exactly. I heard he™s a sort of savage Š lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire to his bed.ﬂ        ﬁI think he™s brilliant,ﬂ said Harry coldly. \\n \\n      ﬁDo you?ﬂ said the boy, with a slight sneer. ﬁW\\nhy is he with you? Where are your parents?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁThey™re dead,ﬂ said Harry shortly. He didn™t feel much like going into the matter with this boy. \\n \\n      ﬁOh, sorry,ﬂ said the other, not sounding sorry at all. ﬁBut they were our kind, weren™t they?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁThey were a witch and wizard, if that™s what you mean.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁI really don™t think they should let the other sort in, do you? They™re \\njust not the same, they™ve \\nnever been brought up to know our ways. Some of \\nthem have never even heard of Hogwarts until \\nthey get the letter, imagine. I think they should \\nkeep it in the old wizarding families. What™s your \\nsurname, anyway?ﬂ \\n \\n      But before Harry could answer, Madam Malk\\nin said, ﬁThat™s you done, my dear,ﬂ and Harry, not \\nsorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down from the footstool. \\n \\n      ﬁWell, I™ll see you at Hogw\\narts, I suppose,ﬂ said the drawling boy. \\n \\n      Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought hi\\nm (chocolate and raspberry \\nwith chopped nuts).        ﬁWhat™s up?ﬂ said Hagrid. \\n \\n      ﬁNothing,ﬂ Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment and quills. Harry cheered up a bit when \\nhe found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote. When they had left the shop, he said, \\nﬁHagrid, what™s Quidditch?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁBlimey, Harry, I keep forgettin™ how\\n little yeh know Š not knowin™ about Quidditch!ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁDon™t make me feel worse,ﬂ said Harry. He\\n told Hagrid about the pale boy in Madam Malkin™s. \\n \\n      ﬁŠ and he said people from Muggle families shouldn™t even be allowed in Šﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁYer not from a Muggle family. If he™d known who yeh \\nwere Š he™s grown up knowin™ yer name if his parents are wizardin™\\n folk. You saw what everyone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh. Anyway, what does he know about it, some o™ the best I ever saw were the \\nonly ones with magic in ‚em in a long line o™ Muggles Š look at yer mum! Look what she had \\n\\nfer a sister!ﬂ  \\n      ﬁSo what is Quidditch?ﬂ \\n       ﬁIt™s our sport. Wizard sport. It™s like \\nŠ like soccer in the Muggle world Š everyone follows \\nQuidditch Š played up in the air on broomsticks \\nand there™s four balls Š sorta hard ter explain the rules.ﬂ \\n       ﬁAnd what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁSchool houses. There™s four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o™ duffers, but Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁI bet I™m in Hufflepuff,ﬂ said Harry gloomily. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁBetter Hufflepuff than Slytherin,ﬂ said \\nHagrid darkly. ﬁThere™s not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn™t in Slytherin. You-Know-Who was one.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁVol-, sorry ŠYou-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁYears an™ years ago,ﬂ said Hagrid. \\n \\n      They bought Harry™s school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts where the shelves were \\nstacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in \\nthem at all. Even Dudley, who never read anyt\\nhing, would have been wild to get his hands on some of these. Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from \\nCurses and Countercurses (Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, Tongue-Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor Vindictus Viridian.  \\n      ﬁI was trying to find out how to curse Dudley.ﬂ        ﬁI™m not sayin™ that™s not a good idea, but \\nyer not ter use magic in the Muggle world except in \\nvery special circumstances,ﬂ said Hagrid. ﬁAn™ \\nanyway, yeh couldn™ work any of them curses yet, yeh™ll need a lot more study \\nbefore yeh get ter that level.ﬂ \\n \\n      Hagrid wouldn™t let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either (ﬁIt says pewter on yer listﬂ), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope. Then they visited the Apothecary, which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible \\nsmell, a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages. \\nBarrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor; jars of \\nherbs, dried roots, and bright powders lined the walls; bundles of feathers\\n, strings of fangs, and snarled claws hung from the ceiling. While Hagrid \\nasked the man behind the counter for a supply \\nof some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harr\\ny himself examined silver unicorn horns at \\ntwenty-one Galleons each and minuscule, glitte\\nry-black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop). \\n \\n      Outside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry™s list again.  \\n      ﬁJust yer wand left Š A yeah, an™ I still haven™t got ye\\nh a birthday present.ﬂ  \\n      Harry felt himself go red. \\n\\n       ﬁYou don™t have to Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁI know I don™t have to. Tell yeh what, I™ll get yer animal. Not a toad, toads went outta fashion \\nyears ago, yeh™d be laughed at Š an™ I don™ like cat\\ns, they make me sneeze. I™ll get yer an owl. \\nAll the kids want owls, they™re dead useful, carry yer mail an™ everythin™.ﬂ \\n \\n      Twenty minutes later, they left Eeylops \\nOwl Emporium, which had been dark and full of rustling \\nand flickering, jewel-bright eyes. Harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with her head under her wing. He couldn™t stop stammering hi\\ns thanks, sounding just like Professor Quirrell. \\n \\n      ﬁDon™ mention it,ﬂ said Hagrid gruffly. ﬁDon™ expect you™ve had a lotta presents from them \\nDursleys. Just Ollivanders left now Š only place fer wands, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the \\n\\nbest wand.ﬂ  \\n      A magic wand– this was what Ha\\nrry had been really looking forward to.  \\n      The last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over the door read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. A single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty \\n\\nwindow.  \\n      A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths\\n of the shop as they stepped inside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair that\\n Hagrid sat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as \\nthough he had entered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousa\\nnds of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling. For some reason, the back of his neck pric\\nkled. The very dust and silence in here seemed \\nto tingle with some secret magic. \\n \\n      ﬁGood afternoon,ﬂ said a soft voice. Harry jumped. Hagrid must have \\njumped, too, because there \\nwas a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the spindly chair.  \\n      An old man was standing before them, his \\nwide, pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom \\nof the shop.  \\n      ﬁHello,ﬂ said Harry awkwardly. \\n \\n      ﬁAh yes,ﬂ said the man. ﬁYes, yes. I thought I™d be seeing you soon. Harry Potter.ﬂ It wasn™t a question. ﬁYou have your mother™s eyes. It seems \\nonly yesterday she was in here herself, buying \\nher first wand. Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for charm \\n\\nwork.ﬂ  \\n      Mr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry \\nwished he would blink. Those silvery eyes were a bit creepy.  \\n      ﬁYour father, on the other hand, favored a \\nmahogany wand. Eleven inches. Pliable. A little more \\npower and excellent for transfiguration. Well, I say your father fa\\nvored it Š it™s really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course.ﬂ        Mr. Ollivander had come so close that he \\nand Harry were almost nose to nose. Harry could see \\nhimself reflected in those misty eyes. \\n \\n      ﬁAnd that™s where–ﬂ \\n \\n      Mr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry™s forehead with a long, white finger.  \\n      ﬁI™m sorry to say I sold the wand that di\\nd it,ﬂ he said softly. ﬁThirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. \\nPowerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong hands– well, if I™d known what that wand was going out into the world to do–ﬂ  \\n      He shook his head and then, to Harry™s relief, spotted Hagrid. \\n \\n      ﬁRubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again– Oak, sixteen inches, rather bendy, wasn™t it?ﬂ  \\n      ﬁIt was, sir, yes,ﬂ said Hagrid. \\n \\n      ﬁGood wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled?ﬂ said Mr. Ollivander, suddenly stern.  \\n      ﬁEr Š yes, they did, yes,ﬂ said Hagrid, s\\nhuffling his feet. ﬁI™ve still got the pieces, though,ﬂ he added brightly.        ﬁBut you don™t use them?ﬂ said Mr. Ollivander sharply. \\n       ﬁOh, no, sir,ﬂ said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed\\n he gripped his pink umbr\\nella very tightly as he spoke.  \\n      ﬁHmmm,ﬂ said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagr\\nid a piercing look. ﬁWell, now Š Mr. Potter. Let me \\nsee.ﬂ He pulled a long tape measur\\ne with silver markings out of his pocket. ﬁWhich is your wand \\narm?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁEr Š well, I™m right-handed,ﬂ said Harry. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁHold out your arm. That™s\\n it.ﬂ He measured Harry from shoulde\\nr to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and round his hea\\nd. As he measured, he said, ﬁEvery Ollivander \\nwand has a core of a powerful ma\\ngical substance, Mr. Potter. We \\nuse unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the heartstrings of dragons. No tw\\no Ollivander wands are the same, just as no two \\nunicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the sa\\nme. And of course, you w\\nill never get such good \\nresults with another wizard™s wand.ﬂ  \\n      Harry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was measuring between his nostrils, was \\ndoing this on its own. Mr. Ollivander was f\\nlitting around the shelves, taking down boxes. \\n      ﬁThat will do,ﬂ he said, and the tape measur\\ne crumpled into a heap on the floor. ﬁRight then, Mr. \\nPotter. Try this one. Beechwood and dragon heartstr\\ning. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. just take it and give it a wave.ﬂ        Harry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a bit, but Mr. Ollivander snatched it \\nout of his hand almost at once. \\n \\n      ﬁMaple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite whippy. Try Šﬂ \\n \\n      Harry tried Š but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, was snatched back by Mr. Ollivander. \\n \\n      ﬁNo, no Š here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches, springy. Go on, go on, try it \\nout.ﬂ  \\n      Harry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr. Ollivander was waiting for. The pile of tried \\nwands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair, but the more wands Mr. Ollivander \\n\\npulled from the shelves, the happier he seemed to become. \\n \\n      ﬁTricky customer, eh? Not to worry, we™ll \\nfind the perfect match here somewhere Š I wonder, \\nnow Š yes, why not Š unusual combination Š holly\\n and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple.ﬂ  \\n      Harry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth \\nin his fingers. He raised the wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the \\nend like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid whooped and clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried, ﬁOh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. We\\nll, well, well– how curious– how very curious–ﬂ  \\n      He put Harry™s wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper, still muttering, \\nﬁCurious– curious–ﬂ  \\n      ﬁSorry,ﬂ said Harry, ﬁbut what™s curious?ﬂ \\n \\n      Mr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare. \\n \\n      ﬁI remember every wand I™ve ever sold, Mr\\n. Potter. Every single wand. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another feather Š just one other. It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother Š why, its brother gave you that scar.ﬂ  \\n      Harry swallowed. \\n \\n      ﬁYes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these things happen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember– I think we must\\n expect great things from you, Mr. Potter– After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did gr\\neat things Š terrible, yes, but great.ﬂ       Harry shivered. He wasn™t sure he liked\\n Mr. Ollivander too much. He paid seven gold Galleons \\nfor his wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from his shop. \\n    The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky \\nas Harry and Hagrid made their way back down \\nDiagon Alley, back through the wall, back through the Leaky Cauldron, now empty. Harry didn™t \\nspeak at all as they walked down the road; he \\ndidn™t even notice how much people were gawking \\nat them on the Underground, laden as they were \\nwith all their funny-shaped packages, with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on Harry™s lap. Up another escalator, out into Paddington station; Harry only realized where they were when Hagrid tapped him on the shoulder.  \\n      ﬁGot time fer a bite to eat\\n before yer train leaves,ﬂ he said.  \\n      He bought Harry a hamburger and they sat do\\nwn on plastic seats to eat them. Harry kept looking \\naround. Everything looked so strange, somehow. \\n \\n      ﬁYou all right, Harry? \\nYer very quiet,ﬂ said Hagrid. \\n \\n      Harry wasn™t sure he could explain. He™d just had the best birthday of his life Š and yet Š he chewed his hamburger, trying to find the words. \\n \\n      ﬁEveryone thinks I™m special,ﬂ he said at last. ﬁAll those people in the Leaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr. Ollivander– but I don™t know anything about magic at all. How can they \\nexpect great things? I™m famous\\n and I can™t even remember what I™m famous for. I don™t know \\nwhat happened when Vol-, sorry Š I mean, the night my parents died.ﬂ \\n \\n      Hagrid leaned across the table. Behind th\\ne wild beard and eyebrows he wore a very kind smile. \\n \\n      ﬁDon™ you worry, Harry. You™ll learn fast enough. Everyone starts at the beginning at Hogwarts, you™ll be just fine. Just be yerself. I know it™s hard. Yeh™ve been singled out, an™ that™s always hard. But yeh™ll have a great time at Hogwar\\nts Š I did Š still do, ™smatter of fact.ﬂ \\n \\n      Hagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back to the Dursleys, then handed him \\nan envelope.  \\n      ﬁYer ticket fer Hogwarts, ﬁ he said. ﬁFirst o™ September Š King™s Cross Š it™s all on yer ticket. \\nAny problems with the Dursleys, se\\nnd me a letter with yer owl, sh\\ne™ll know where to find me– . \\nSee yeh soon, Harry.ﬂ  \\n      The train pulled out of the station. Harry wanted to watch Hagrid until he was out of sight; he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against the window, but he blinked and Hagrid had gone.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n CHAPTER SIX \\n  The Journey From Platform Nine and Three-Quarters \\n    Harry™s last month with the Du\\nrsleys wasn™t fun. True, Dudley was now so scared of Harry he wouldn™t stay in the same room, while Aunt Pe\\ntunia and Uncle Vernon didn™t shut Harry in his cupboard, force him to do anything, or\\n shout at him Š in fact, they \\ndidn™t speak to him at all. \\nHalf terrified, half furious, they acted as though any chair with Harry in it were empty. Although \\nthis was an improvement in many ways, it \\ndid become a bit depr\\nessing after a while.  \\n      Harry kept to his room, with his new owl for company. He had decided to call her Hedwig, a \\nname he had found in \\nA History of Magic. His school books were very interesting. He lay on his bed reading late into the night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased. It was lucky that Aunt Petunia didn™t come in to vacuum anymore, because Hedwig kept \\n\\nbringing back dead mice. Every night before he \\nwent to sleep, Harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall, counting down to September the first. \\n \\n      On the last day of August he thought he™d better speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to King™s Cross station the next day, so he went down to the living room where they were watching \\na quiz show on television. He cleared his throat to let them k\\nnow he was there, and Dudley screamed and ran from the room. \\n \\n      ﬁEr Š Uncle Vernon?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      Uncle Vernon grunted to show he was listening.        ﬁEr Š I need to be at King™s Cross tomorrow to Š to go to Hogwarts.ﬂ \\n \\n      Uncle Vernon grunted again. \\n \\n      ﬁWould it be all ri\\nght if you gave me a lift?ﬂ \\n \\n      Grunt. Harry supposed that meant yes. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁThank you.ﬂ \\n \\n      He was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon actually spoke.  \\n      ﬁFunny way to get to a wizards™ school, the train. Magic carpets all got punctures, have they?ﬂ  \\n      Harry didn™t say anything. \\n \\n      ﬁWhere is this school, anyway?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁI don™t know,ﬂ said Harry, realizing this for the first time. He\\n pulled the ticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket. \\n       ﬁI just take the train from platform ni\\nne and three-quarters at eleven o™clock,ﬂ he read.  \\n      His aunt and uncle stared. \\n \\n      ﬁPlatform what?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁNine and three-quarters.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁDon™t talk rubbish,ﬂ said Uncle Vernon. ﬁThere is no platform nine and three-quarters.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁIt™s on my ticket.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁBarking,ﬂ said Uncle Vernon, ﬁhowling ma\\nd, the lot of them. You™ll \\nsee. You just wait. All right, we™ll take you to King™s Cross. We™re going up to London tomorrow anyway, or I \\nwouldn™t bother.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁWhy are you going to London?ﬂ Harry\\n asked, trying to keep things friendly.  \\n      ﬁTaking Dudley to the hospital,ﬂ growled Uncle Vernon. ﬁGot to have that ruddy tail removed \\nbefore he goes to Smeltings.ﬂ \\n \\n   Harry woke at five o™cloc\\nk the next morning and was too excited and nervous to go back to sleep. He got up and pulled on his jeans because he didn™t want to walk into the station in his \\n\\nwizard™s robes Š he™d change on the train. He checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure \\nhe had everything he needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her cage, and then paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up. Two hou\\nrs later, Harry™s huge, heavy trunk had been \\nloaded into the Dursleys™ car, Aunt Petunia had talk\\ned Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they \\nhad set off.  \\n      They reached King™s Cross at half past ten. Uncle Vernon dumped Harry™s trunk onto a cart and \\nwheeled it into the station for him. Harry t\\nhought this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon \\nstopped dead, facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face. \\n \\n      ﬁWell, there you are, boy. Platform nine Š \\nplatform ten. Your platform should be somewhere in \\nthe middle, but they don™t seem to have built it yet, do they?ﬂ \\n \\n      He was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic number nine over one platform and a big \\nplastic number ten over the one next to it, and in the middle, nothing at all. \\n \\n      ﬁHave a good term,ﬂ said Uncle Vernon with\\n an even nastier smile. \\nHe left without another word. Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away. All three of them were laughing. Harry™s mouth went rather dry. What on earth was he going to do? He was starting to attract a lot of \\nfunny looks, because of Hedwig. He™d have to ask someone. \\n       He stopped a passing guard, but didn™t dare mention platform nine and three-quarters. The guard \\nhad never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry couldn™t even tell him what part of the country it \\nwas in, he started to get annoyed, as though Harry was being stupid on purpose. Getting desperate, Harry asked for the train that left at\\n eleven o™clock, but the guard said there wasn™t one. In the end the guard strode away, muttering about time waster\\ns. Harry was now trying hard not to panic. According to the large clock over the arrivals board, he had ten minutes left to get \\non the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it; he was stranded in the middle of a \\nstation with a trunk he could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl. \\n \\n      Hagrid must have forgotten to tell him \\nsomething you had to do, like tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley. He wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector™s stand betw\\neen platforms nine and ten. \\n \\n      At that moment a group of people passed \\njust behind him and he caught a few words of what \\nthey were saying.  \\n      ﬁŠ packed with Muggles, of course Šﬂ \\n \\n      Harry swung round. The speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four boys, all with \\nflaming red hair. Each of them was pushing a tr\\nunk like Harry™s in front of him Š and they had \\nan owl.  \\n      Heart hammering, Harry pushed his cart after them. They stopped and so did he, just near \\nenough to hear what they were saying.  \\n      ﬁNow, what™s the platform number?ﬂ said the boys™ mother. \\n \\n      ﬁNine and three-quarters!ﬂ piped a sma\\nll girl, also red-headed, who was holding her hand, ﬁMom, can™t I go–ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁYou™re not old enough, Ginny, now be quiet. All right, Percy, you go first.ﬂ \\n \\n      What looked like the oldest boy marched to\\nward platforms nine and ten. Harry watched, careful \\nnot to blink in case he missed it Š but just as\\n the boy reached the dividing barrier between the \\n\\ntwo platforms, a large crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last \\n\\nbackpack had cleared away, the boy had vanished. \\n \\n      ﬁFred, you next,ﬂ the plump woman said. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁI™m not Fred, I™m George,ﬂ said \\nthe boy. ﬁHonestly, woman, you call yourself our mother? \\nCan™t you tell\\n I™m George?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁSorry, George, dear.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁOnly joking, I am Fred,ﬂ said the boy, and \\noff he went. His twin called after him to hurry up, \\nand he must have done so, because a second la\\nter, he had gone Š but how had he done it? \\n      Now the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier he was almost there Š and then, \\nquite suddenly, he wasn™t anywhere.        There was nothing else for it. \\n \\n      ﬁExcuse me,ﬂ Harry\\n said to the plump woman. \\n \\n      ﬁHello, dear,ﬂ she said. ﬁFirst time at Hogwarts? Ron™s new, too.ﬂ \\n \\n      She pointed at the last and youngest of her sons. He was tall, thin, and gangling, with freckles, \\nbig hands and feet, and a long nose.  \\n      ﬁYes,ﬂ said Harry. ﬁThe thing is Š the thing is, I don™t know how to Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁHow to get onto the platform?ﬂ she said kindly, and Harry nodded. \\n \\n      ﬁNot to worry,ﬂ she said. ﬁAll you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms \\nnine and ten. Don™t stop and don™t be scared you™ll crash into it, that™s very important. Best do it \\nat a bit of a run if you™re nervous. Go on, go now before Ron.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁEr Š okay,ﬂ said Harry. \\n\\n \\n      He pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier. It looked very solid. \\n \\n      He started to walk toward it. People jostled him on their way to platforms nine and ten. Harry \\nwalked more quickly. He was going to smash right \\ninto that barrier and then he™d be in trouble Š leaning forward on his cart, he broke into a \\nheavy run Š the barrier was coming nearer and \\nnearer Š he wouldn™t be able to stop Š the cart was out of control Š he was a foot away Š he closed his eyes ready for the crash Š \\n \\n      It didn™t come– he kept on running– he\\n opened his eyes. A scarlet steam engine was waiting \\nnext to a platform packed with people. A sign overhead said \\nHogwarts™ Express, eleven o™clock. Harry looked behind him and saw a wrought-iron archway where the barrier had been, with the words Platform Nine and Three-Quarters on it, He had done it.  \\n      Smoke from the engine drifted over the head\\ns of the chattering crowd, while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs. Owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunks.  \\n      The first few carriages were already packed with students, some hanging out of the window to \\ntalk to their families, some fighting over seats.\\n Harry pushed his cart off down the platform in \\nsearch of an empty seat. He passed a round-f\\naced boy who was saying, ﬁGran, I™ve lost my toad \\nagain.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁOh, Neville,ﬂ he heard the old woman sigh. \\n       A boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd. \\n \\n      ﬁGive us a look, Lee, go on.ﬂ \\n \\n      The boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the people around him shrieked and yelled as \\nsomething inside poked out a long, hairy leg. \\n \\n      Harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment near the end of the \\ntrain. He put Hedwig inside first and then started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door. He tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his foot.  \\n      ﬁWant a hand?ﬂ It was one of the red-\\nhaired twins he™d followed through the barrier. \\n \\n      ﬁYes, please,ﬂ Harry panted. \\n \\n      ﬁOy, Fred! C™mere and help!ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      With the twins™ help, Harry™s trunk was at \\nlast tucked away in a corner of the compartment. \\n \\n      ﬁThanks,ﬂ said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes.  \\n      ﬁWhat™s that?ﬂ said one of the twin\\ns suddenly, pointing at Harry™s lightning scar.  \\n      ﬁBlimey,ﬂ said the other twin. ﬁAre you Š?ﬂ \\n\\n       ﬁHe is,ﬂ said the first twin. ﬁAren™t you?ﬂ he added to Harry. \\n \\n      ﬁWhat?ﬂ said Harry. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁHarry Potter.ﬂ chorused the twins. \\n \\n      ﬁOh, him,ﬂ said Harry. ﬁI mean, yes, I am.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      The two boys gawked at him, and Harry felt \\nhimself turning red. Then, to his relief, a voice came \\nfloating in through the train™s open door.  \\n      ﬁFred? George? Are you there?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁComing, Mom.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      With a last look at Harry, the twins hopped off the train. \\n\\n \\n      Harry sat down next to the window where, half hidden, he could watch the red-haired family on \\nthe platform and hear what they were saying. Th\\neir mother had just taken out her handkerchief. \\n       ﬁRon, you™ve got something on your nose.ﬂ \\n \\n      The youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she grabbed him and began rubbing the end of \\nhis nose.  \\n      ﬁMomŠ geroffﬂ He wriggled free.  \\n      ﬁAaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie?ﬂ said one of the twins. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁShut up,ﬂ said Ron. \\n \\n      ﬁWhere™s Percy?ﬂ said their mother. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁHe™s coming now.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      The oldest boy came striding into sight. \\nHe had already changed into his billowing black Hogwarts robes, and Harry noticed a red and gold badge on his chest with the letter P on it.  \\n      ﬁCan™t stay long, Mother,ﬂ he said. ﬁI™m up front, the prefects have got two compartments to \\nthemselves Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁOh, are you a prefect, Percy?ﬂ said one of the twins, with an air of great surprise. ﬁYou should have said something, we had no idea.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁHang on, I think I remember him saying so\\nmething about it,ﬂ said th\\ne other twin. ﬁOnce Šﬂ        ﬁOr twice Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁA minute Šﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁAll summer Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁOh, shut up,ﬂ said Percy the Prefect. \\n \\n      ﬁHow come Percy gets new r\\nobes, anyway?ﬂ said one of the twins.  \\n      ﬁBecause he™s a \\nprefect\\n,ﬂ said their mother fondly. ﬁAll ri\\nght, dear, well, have a good term Š \\nsend me an owl when you get there.ﬂ \\n \\n      She kissed Percy on the cheek and he left. Then she turned to the twins. \\n \\n      ﬁNow, you two Š this year, you behave yourselves. If I get one more\\n owl telling me you™ve Š \\nyou™ve blown up a toilet or Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁBlown up a toilet? We™ve never blown up a toilet.ﬂ \\n\\n       ﬁGreat idea though, thanks, Mom.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁIt™s not funny. And look after Ron.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁDon™t worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁShut up,ﬂ said Ron again. He was almost as \\ntall as the twins already \\nand his nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it.  \\n      ﬁHey, Mom, guess what? Guess who we just met on the train?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      Harry leaned back quickly so they couldn™t see him looking. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁYou know that black-haired boy who was near us in the station? Know who he is?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWho?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁHarry Potter!ﬂ  \\n      Harry heard the little girl™s voice. \\n \\n      ﬁOh, Mom, can I go on the train and see him, Mom, eh please–ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁYou™ve already seen him, Ginny, and the \\npoor boy isn™t something you goggle at in a zoo. Is he \\nreally, Fred? How do you know?ﬂ \\n       ﬁAsked him. Saw his scar. \\nIt™s really there Š like lightning.ﬂ \\n       ﬁPoor dear Š no wonder he was alone, I wondered. He was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the platform.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁNever mind that, do you think he \\nremembers what You-Know-Who looks like?ﬂ \\n \\n      Their mother suddenly became very stern. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁI forbid you to ask him, Fred. No, don™t \\nyou dare. As though he needs reminding of that on his \\nfirst day at school.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁAll right, keep your hair on.ﬂ \\n \\n      A whistle sounded. \\n \\n      ﬁHurry up!ﬂ their mother said, and the th\\nree boys clambered onto the \\ntrain. They leaned out of the window for her to kiss them good-bye\\n, and their younger sister began to cry.  \\n      ﬁDon™t, Ginny, we™ll send you loads of owls.ﬂ       ﬁWe™ll send you a Hogwarts™ toilet seat.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁGeorge!ﬂ  \\n      ﬁOnly joking, Mom.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      The train began to move. Harry saw the boys™ mother waving and their \\nsister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep up with the train until it ga\\nthered too much speed, then she fell back and \\nwaved.  \\n      Harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the corner. Houses flashed past the window. Harry felt a great leap of excitement. He didn™t know what he was going to Š \\n\\nbut it had to be better than what he was leaving behind.  \\n      The door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy came in. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁAnyone sitting there?ﬂ he asked, pointing at\\n the seat opposite Harry. ﬁEverywhere else is full.ﬂ  \\n      Harry shook his head and the boy sat down. He glanced at Harry and then looked quickly out of the window, pretending he hadn™t looked. Harry saw he still had a black mark on his nose. \\n \\n      ﬁHey, Ron.ﬂ \\n \\n      The twins were back. \\n \\n      ﬁListen, we™re going down the middle of th\\ne train Š Lee Jordan™s got a giant tarantula down there.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁRight,ﬂ mumbled Ron. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁHarry,ﬂ said the other twin, ﬁdid we introduce ourselves? Fred and George Weasley. And this is \\nRon, our brother. See you later, then.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁBye,ﬂ said Harry and Ron. The twins slid the compartment door shut behind them. \\n \\n      ﬁAre you really Harry Potter?ﬂ Ron blurted out. \\n \\n      Harry nodded. \\n \\n      ﬁOh Š well, I thought it might be one of\\n Fred and George™s jokes,ﬂ said Ron. ﬁAnd have you really got Š you know–ﬂ  \\n      He pointed at Harry™s forehead. \\n \\n      Harry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar. Ron stared. \\n\\n       ﬁSo that™s where You-Know-Who Š?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁYes,ﬂ said Harry, ﬁbut I can™t remember it.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁNothing?ﬂ said Ron eagerly. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁWell Š I remember a lo\\nt of green light, but nothing else.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁWow,ﬂ said Ron. He sat and stared at\\n Harry for a few moments, then, as though he had \\nsuddenly realized what he was doing, he looked quickly out of the window again.  \\n      ﬁAre all your family wizards?ﬂ asked Ha\\nrry, who found Ron just as interesting as Ron found him. \\n \\n      ﬁEr Š Yes, I think so,ﬂ said Ron. ﬁI think Mom™s got a sec\\nond cousin who™s an accountant, but we never talk about him.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁSo you must know loads of magic already.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      The Weasleys were clearly one of those \\nold wizarding families the pa\\nle boy in Diagon Alley had talked about.  \\n      ﬁI heard you went to live with Muggles,ﬂ said Ron. ﬁW\\nhat are they like?ﬂ  \\n      ﬁHorrible Š well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are, though. Wish I™d had three \\nwizard brothers.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁFive,ﬂ said Ron. For some reason, he was \\nlooking gloomy. ﬁI™m the sixth in our family to go to \\nHogwarts. You could say I™ve got a lot to live \\nup to. Bill and Charlie have already left Š Bill \\nwas head boy and Charlie was captain of Quidditch. Now Percy™s a prefect. Fred and George mess around a lot, but they still \\nget really good marks and everyone\\n thinks they™re really funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the others, \\nbut if I do, it™s no big deal, because they did it \\nfirst. You never get anything new, either, with five brothers. I™ve got Bill\\n™s old robes, Charlie™s old wand, and Percy™s old rat.ﬂ  \\n      Ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was asleep.  \\n      ﬁHis name™s Scabbers and he™s useless, he\\n hardly ever wakes up. Percy got an owl from my dad \\nfor being made a prefect, but they couldn™\\nt aff Š I mean, I got Scabbers instead.ﬂ \\n \\n      Ron™s ears went pink. He seemed to think \\nhe™d said too much, because he went back to staring \\nout of the window.  \\n      Harry didn™t think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl. After all, he™d never had any money in his life until a month ago, \\nand he told Ron so, all about having to wear \\n\\nDudley™s old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents. This seemed to cheer Ron up. \\n      ﬁ– and until Hagrid told me, I didn™t know anything about being a wizard or about my parents \\nor Voldemort Šﬂ \\n       Ron gasped. \\n \\n      ﬁWhat?ﬂ said Harry. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁYou said You-Know-Who™s name!\\nﬂ said Ron, sounding both shocked and impressed. ﬁI™d have \\nthought you, of all people Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁI™m not trying to be \\nbrave or anything, saying the name,ﬂ \\nsaid Harry, ﬁI just never knew you shouldn™t. See what I mean? I™ve got loads to l\\nearn– I bet,ﬂ he added, voicing for the first time \\nsomething that had been worrying him a lot la\\ntely, ﬁI bet I™m the worst in the class.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁYou won™t be. There™s loads of people who come from Muggle famili\\nes and they learn quick enough.ﬂ  \\n      While they had been ta\\nlking, the train had carried them out\\n of London. Now they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep. They were qu\\niet for a time, watching the fields and lanes flick \\npast.  \\n      Around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling, \\ndimpled woman slid back their door a\\nnd said, ﬁAnything off the cart, dears?ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry, who hadn™t had any breakfast, leapt \\nto his feet, but Ron™s ears went pink again and he muttered that he™d brought sandwiches. Harry went out into the corridor.  \\n      He had never had any money for candy with \\nthe Dursleys, and now that he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many\\n Mars Bars as he could carry Š but the woman \\n\\ndidn™t have Mars Bars. What she did have were\\n Bettie Bott™s Every Flavor Beans, Drooble™s \\nBest Blowing Gum, Chocolate Frogs. Pumpkin Pa\\nsties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice Wands, and a \\nnumber of other strange things \\nHarry had never seen in his life. Not wanting to miss anything, he \\ngot some of everything and paid the woman el\\neven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts. \\n \\n      Ron stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat. \\n \\n      ﬁHungry, are you?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁStarving,ﬂ said Harry, taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty. \\n \\n      Ron had taken out a lumpy package and unw\\nrapped it. There were four sandwiches inside. He pulled one of them apart and said, ﬁShe \\nalways forgets I don™t like corned beef..ﬂ  \\n      ﬁSwap you for one of these,ﬂ said Harry, holding up a pasty. ﬁGo on Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁYou don™t want this, it™s all dry,ﬂ said Ron. ﬁShe hasn™t got much time,ﬂ he added quickly, ﬁyou \\nknow, with five of us.ﬂ        ﬁGo on, have a pasty,ﬂ said Harry, who had never had anything to share before or, indeed, anyone to share it with. It was a nice feeling, sitting there with Ron, eating their way through all Harry™s pasties, cakes, and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten).  \\n      ﬁWhat are these?ﬂ Harry asked Ron, hol\\nding up a pack of Chocolate Frogs. ﬁThey™re not \\nreally\\n frogs, are they?ﬂ He was starting to f\\neel that nothing would surprise him. \\n \\n      ﬁNo,ﬂ said Ron. ﬁBut see what the card is. I™m missing Agrippa.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁWhat?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁOh, of course, you wouldn™t know Š Chocolate Frogs have\\n cards, inside them, you know, to \\ncollect Š famous witches and wizards. I™ve got about five hundred, but I haven™t got Agrippa or Ptolemy.ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and pick\\ned up the card. It showed a man™s face. He wore \\nhalf-moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose, an\\nd flowing silver hair, beard, and mustache. \\nUnderneath the picture was the name Albus Dumbledore.  \\n      ﬁSo this is Dumbledore!ﬂ said Harry. \\n \\n      ﬁDon™t tell me you™d never heard of Dumble\\ndore!ﬂ said Ron. ﬁCan I have a frog? I might get \\nAgrippa Š thanks Šﬂ        Harry turned over his card and read:    ALBUS DUMBLEDORE \\n \\n  CURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS \\n     Considered by many the greatest wizard of \\nmodern times, Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of \\ndragon™s blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Professor \\nDumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling.  \\n  Harry turned the card back over and saw, to\\n his astonishment, that\\n Dumbledore™s face had \\ndisappeared.  \\n      ﬁHe™s gone!ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWell, you can™t expect him to hang ar\\nound all day,ﬂ said Ron. ﬁHe™ll be back. No, I™ve got Morgana again and I™ve got about six of her– do you want it? You can start collecting.ﬂ \\n \\n      Ron™s eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be unwrapped. \\n      ﬁHelp yourself,ﬂ said Harry. ﬁBut in, you know, the Muggle world, people just stay put in photos.ﬂ        ﬁDo they? What, they don™t move at all?ﬂ Ron sounded amazed. \\nﬁWeird!ﬂ  \\n      Harry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him a small smile. \\nRon was more interested\\n in eating the frogs than looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards \\ncards, but Harry couldn™t keep his eyes o\\nff them. Soon he had not only Dumbledore and \\nMorgana, but Hengist of Woodcroft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin. He finally tore his eyes away from the Druidess Cliodna, \\nwho was scratching her nose, to open a bag of Bertie Bott™s Every Flavor Beans.  \\n      ﬁYou want to be careful with those,ﬂ Ron warned Harry. ﬁWhen they say every flavor, they mean every flavor Š you know, you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and \\nmarmalade, but then you can get spinach and li\\nver and tripe. George reckons he had a booger-flavored one once.ﬂ  \\n      Ron picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, and bit into a corner. \\n \\n      ﬁBleaaargh Š see? Sprouts.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      They had a good time eating the Every Flav\\nor Beans. Harry got toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron wouldn™t touch, which turned out to be pepper.  \\n      The countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder. The neat fields had gone. \\nNow there were woods, twisting rivers, and dark green hills.  \\n      There was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round-faced boy Harry had passed \\non platform nine and three-quart\\ners came in. He looked tearful. \\n \\n      ﬁSorry,ﬂ he said, ﬁbut have you seen a toad at all?ﬂ  \\n      When they shook their heads, he wailed, \\nﬁI™ve lost him! He keeps getting away from me!ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁHe™ll turn up,ﬂ said Harry. \\n \\n      ﬁYes,ﬂ said the boy miserably. ﬁWell, if you see him–ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      He left. \\n \\n      ﬁDon™t know why he™s so bothered,ﬂ said Ron.\\n ﬁIf I™d brought a toad I™d lose it as quick as I could. Mind you, I brought Scabbers, so I can™t talk.ﬂ  \\n      The rat was still snoozing on Ron™s lap. \\n       ﬁHe might have died and you wouldn™t know the \\ndifference,ﬂ said Ron in disgust. ﬁI tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting, but the spell didn™t work. I™ll show you, \\nlook–ﬂ  \\n      He rummaged around in his trunk and pulled \\nout a very battered-looking wand. It was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the end. \\n \\n      ﬁUnicorn hair™s nearly poking out. Anyway Šﬂ \\n \\n      He had just raised his wand when the compartment door slid open again. The toadless boy was \\nback, but this time he had a girl with him. Sh\\ne was already wearing her new Hogwarts robes.  \\n      ﬁHas anyone seen a toad? Neville™s lost one,ﬂ\\n she said. She had a bossy \\nsort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair, and rather large front teeth. \\n \\n      ﬁWe™ve already told him we haven™t seen \\nit,ﬂ said Ron, but the girl wasn™t listening, she was looking at the wand in his hand.  \\n      ﬁOh, are you doing magic? Let™s see it, then.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      She sat down. Ron looked taken aback. \\n \\n      ﬁEr Š all right.ﬂ \\n \\n      He cleared his throat.   ﬁSunshine, daisies, butter mellow, Tu\\nrn this stupid, fat rat yellow.ﬂ  \\n     He waved his wand, but nothing happene\\nd. Scabbers stayed gray and fast asleep.  \\n      ﬁAre you sure that™s a real spell?ﬂ said the girl. ﬁWell, it™s not very \\ngood, is it? I™ve tried a few simple spells just for practice and it™s all worked\\n for me. Nobody in my family™s magic at all, it \\nwas ever such a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so please\\nd, of course, I mean, it™s \\nthe very best school of witchcraft there is, I™ve heard Š I™ve learned \\nall our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough Š I™m Hermione Granger, by the way, who are \\nyou?ﬂ \\n \\n      She said all this very fast. \\n \\n      Harry looked at Ron, and was relieved to \\nsee by his stunned face that \\nhe hadn™t learned all the \\ncourse books by heart either.  \\n      ﬁI™m Ron Weasley,ﬂ Ron muttered. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁHarry Potter,ﬂ said Harry. \\n\\n       ﬁAre you really?ﬂ said Hermione. ﬁI know \\nall about you, of course Š I got a few extra books, for background reading, and you™re in Modern Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century.ﬂ        ﬁAm I?ﬂ said Harry, feeling dazed. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁGoodness, didn™t you know, I™d have found out everything I could if it was me,ﬂ said Hermione. \\nﬁDo either of you know what house you™ll be in? I™ve been asking around, and I hope I™m in \\nGryffindor, it sounds by far the best; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose \\nRavenclaw wouldn™t be too bad– Anyway, we™d better go and look for Neville™s toad. You two \\nhad better change, you know, I expect we™ll be there soon.ﬂ  \\n      And she left, taking the toadless boy with her. \\n \\n      ﬁWhatever house I™m in, I hope she™s not in \\nit,ﬂ said Ron. He threw his wand back into his trunk. ﬁStupid spell Š George gave it to me, bet he knew it was a dud.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁWhat house are your \\nbrothers in?ﬂ asked Harry. \\n \\n      ﬁGryffindor,ﬂ said Ron. Gloom seemed to \\nbe settling on him again. ﬁMom and Dad were in it, \\ntoo. I don™t know what they™ll say if I™m not. I don™t suppose Ravenclaw \\nwould be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁThat™s the house Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁYeah,ﬂ said Ron. He flopped back into his seat, looking depressed.  \\n      ﬁYou know, I think the ends of Scabbers™ whiskers are a bit lighter,ﬂ said Harry, trying to take Ron™s mind off houses. ﬁSo what do your oldest br\\nothers do now that they™ve left, anyway?ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry was wondering what a wizard did once he™d finished school.  \\n      ﬁCharlie™s in Romania studying dragons, \\nand Bill™s in Africa doing something for Gringotts,ﬂ \\nsaid Ron. ﬁDid you hear about Gringotts? It™s b\\neen all over the Daily Prophet, but I don™t suppose you get that with the Muggles Š some\\none tried to rob a high security vault.ﬂ  \\n      Harry stared. \\n \\n      ﬁReally? What happened to them?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁNothing, that™s why it™s such big news. They haven™t been caught. My dad says it must™ve been \\na powerful Dark wizard to get round Gringotts, but they don™t think they took anything, that™s what™s odd. ™Course, everyone gets scared when something like th\\nis happens in case You-Know-Who™s behind it.ﬂ  \\n      Harry turned this news over in his mind. He \\nwas starting to get a prickle of fear every time You-\\nKnow-Who was mentioned. He supposed this was a\\nll part of entering the magical world, but it \\nhad been a lot more comfortable \\nsaying ﬁVoldemortﬂ without worrying.        ﬁWhat™s your Quidditch team?ﬂ Ron asked. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁEr Š I don™t know any.ﬂ Harry confessed. \\n \\n      ﬁWhat!ﬂ Ron looked dumbfounded. ﬁOh, you wait,\\n it™s the best game in the world Šﬂ And he \\nwas off, explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven players, describing famous games he™d been to with his brothers an\\nd the broomstick he™d like to get if he had the \\nmoney. He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment \\ndoor slid open yet again, but it wasn™t Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this time. \\n \\n      Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: it \\nwas the pale boy from \\nMadam Malkin™s robe shop. He was looking at Harry with a lot more interest than he™d shown \\n\\nback in Diagon Alley.  \\n      ﬁIs it true?ﬂ he said. ﬁThe\\ny™re saying all down the train that Ha\\nrry Potter™s in this compartment. \\nSo it™s you, is it?ﬂ  \\n      ﬁYes,ﬂ said Harry. He was looking at th\\ne other boys. Both of them \\nwere thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either side \\nof the pale boy, they looked like bodyguards.  \\n      ﬁOh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,ﬂ said the pale boy carelessly, noticing where Harry was \\nlooking. ﬁAnd my name™s Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.ﬂ \\n       Ron gave a slight cough, which might have \\nbeen hiding a snigger. Draco Malfoy looked at him. \\n       ﬁThink my name™s funny, do you? No need \\nto ask who you are. My father told me all the \\nWeasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than they can afford.ﬂ \\n \\n      He turned back to Harry. ﬁYou™ll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than \\nothers, Potter. You don™t want to go making friends with the wrong \\nsort. I can help you there.ﬂ  \\n      He held out his hand to shake Harry™s, but Harry\\n didn™t take it.  \\n      ﬁI think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks,ﬂ he said coolly.  \\n      Draco Malfoy didn™t go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks.  \\n      ﬁI™d be careful if I were you, Potter,ﬂ he\\n said slowly. ﬁUnless you™re a bit politer you™ll go the same way as your parents. They didn™t know what was good for them, either. You hang around \\n\\nwith riffraff like the Weasleys and \\nthat Hagrid, and it™ll rub off on you.ﬂ  \\n      Both Harry and Ron stood up. \\n       ﬁSay that again,ﬂ Ron said, his face as red as his hair.        ﬁOh, you™re going to fight us, are you?ﬂ Malfoy sneered. \\n \\n      ﬁUnless you get out now,ﬂ said Harry, more bravely than he fe\\nlt, because Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or Ron. \\n \\n      ﬁBut we don™t feet like leaving, do we, boys? We™ve eaten all \\nour food and you still seem to have \\nsome.ﬂ \\n \\n      Goyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron Š Ron leapt forward, but before he™d so much as touched Goyle, Goyle let out a horrible yell.  \\n      Scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp little teeth sunk deep into Goyle™s knuckle Š Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung Scabbers round and round, howling, and when Scabbers finally flew off and hit the window, all three of them disappeared at once. Perhaps they \\nthought there were more rats lu\\nrking among the sweets, or perh\\naps they™d heard footsteps, because a second later, Hermione Granger had come in. \\n \\n      ﬁWhat \\nhas been going on?ﬂ she said, looking at the \\nsweets all over the floor and Ron picking up Scabbers by his tail.  \\n      ﬁI think he™s been knocked out,ﬂ Ron said to Harry. He looked closer at Scabbers. ﬁNo Š I don™t believe it Š he™s gone back to sleep.ﬂ  \\n      And so he had.        ﬁYou™ve met Malfoy before?ﬂ \\n\\n  \\n      Harry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁI™ve heard of his family,ﬂ said Ron darkl\\ny. ﬁThey were some of the first to come back to our \\nside after You-Know-Who disappeared. Said they™d\\n been bewitched. My dad doesn™t believe it. He says Malfoy™s father didn™t need an excuse to go over to th\\ne Dark Side.ﬂ He turned to Hermione. ﬁCan we help you with something?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁYou™d better hurry up and put your robes on, I™ve just been up to the front to ask the conductor, and he says we™re nearly there. You haven™t been fighting, have you? You™ll be in trouble before \\nwe even get there!ﬂ  \\n      ﬁScabbers has been fighting, not us,ﬂ said\\n Ron, scowling at her. ﬁWould you mind leaving while \\nwe change?ﬂ  \\n      ﬁAll right Š I only came in here because pe\\nople outside are behaving very childishly, racing up \\nand down the corridors,ﬂ said Hermione in a sn\\niffy voice. ﬁAnd you™ve got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you know?ﬂ \\n      Ron glared at her as she left. Harry peered out of the window. It was getting dark. He could see mountains and forests under a deep purple sky. The train did seem to be slowing down. \\n       He and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes. Ron™s were a bit short for him, you could see his sneakers underneath them. \\n \\n      A voice echoed through the train: ﬁWe will be reaching Hogwarts in five minutes™ time. Please \\nleave your luggage on the train, it will \\nbe taken to the school separately.ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry™s stomach lurched with nerves and \\nRon, he saw, looked pale under his freckles. They crammed their pockets with the \\nlast of the sweets and joined the crowd thronging the corridor.  \\n      The train slowed right down and finally stopped. People pushed their way toward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform. Harry shivered in\\n the cold night air. Then a lamp came bobbing \\nover the heads of the students, and Harry heard a familiar voice: ﬁFirs™ years! Firs™ years over \\n\\nhere! All right there, Harry?ﬂ \\n \\n      Hagrid™s big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁC™mon, follow me Š any more firs™ ye\\nars? Mind yer step, now! Fi\\nrs™ years follow me!ﬂ \\n \\n      Slipping and stumbling, they followed Hagr\\nid down what seemed to be a steep, narrow path. It \\nwas so dark on either side of them that Harry\\n thought there must be thick trees there. Nobody spoke much. Neville, the boy who kept lo\\nsing his toad, sniffed once or twice. \\n \\n      ﬁYeh™ll get yer firs™ sight o™ Hogwarts in a sec,ﬂ Hagrid called over his shoulder, ﬁjus™ round this bend here.ﬂ  \\n      There was a loud ﬁOooooh!ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      The narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black\\n lake. Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many \\nturrets and towers.  \\n      ﬁNo more™n four to a boat!ﬂ Hagrid called, po\\ninting to a fleet of little bo\\nats sitting in the water by \\nthe shore. Harry and Ron were followed into their boat by Neville and Hermione. \\n \\n      ﬁEveryone in?ﬂ shouted Hagrid, who ha\\nd a boat to himself. ﬁRight then Š FORWARD!ﬂ \\n \\n      And the fleet of little boats moved off all \\nat once, gliding across the lake, which was as smooth \\nas glass. Everyone was silent, staring up at the great castle overhead. It towered over them as \\nthey sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood.  \\n      ﬁHeads down!ﬂ yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff; they all bent their heads and the \\nlittle boats carried them through a curtain of ivy \\nthat hid a wide opening in the cliff face. They \\nwere carried along a dark tunnel, which seemed \\nto be taking them right underneath the castle, \\nuntil they reached a kind of underground harbor\\n, where they clambered out onto rocks and \\npebbles.        ﬁOy, you there! Is this your toad?ﬂ said Hagrid, who was ch\\necking the boats as people climbed \\nout of them. \\n \\n      ﬁTrevor!ﬂ cried Neville blissfully, holding out his hands. Then they clambered up a passageway \\nin the rock after Hagrid™s lamp, coming out at \\nlast onto smooth, damp gra\\nss right in the shadow \\nof the castle. \\n \\n      They walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge, oak front door.  \\n      ﬁEveryone here? You \\nthere, still got yer toad?ﬂ \\n \\n      Hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle door. \\n \\n         \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n CHAPTER SEVEN \\n  The Sorting Hat  \\n  The door swung open at once. A tall, black-haired \\nwitch in emerald-green robes stood there. She \\nhad a very stern face and Harry™s first thought \\nwas that this was not someone to cross. \\n \\n      ﬁThe firs™ years, Pr\\nofessor McGonagall,ﬂ said Hagrid.  \\n      ﬁThank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      She pulled the door wide. The entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the Dursleys™ house in it. The stone walls were lit w\\nith flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the \\nceiling was too high to make out, and a magnificent \\nmarble staircase facing them led to the upper \\nfloors.  \\n      They followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor. Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right Š the rest of the school must already be here \\nŠ but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. \\nThey crowded in, standing rather closer together than they would us\\nually have done, peering about nervously.  \\n      ﬁWelcome to Hogwarts,ﬂ said Professo\\nr McGonagall. ﬁThe start-of-term banquet will begin \\nshortly, but before you take your seats in the Gr\\neat Hall, you will be sorted into your houses. The \\n\\nSorting is a very important ceremony because\\n, while you are here, your house will be something \\nlike your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your house, sleep in \\n\\nyour house dormitory, and spend free time in your house common room. \\n \\n      ﬁThe four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and \\nSlytherin. Each house has \\nits own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at \\n\\nHogwarts, your triumphs will earn your house \\npoints, while any rulebreaking will lose house \\n\\npoints. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit\\n to whichever house becomes yours. \\n \\n      ﬁThe Sorting Ceremony will take place in a \\nfew minutes in front of the rest of the school. I \\nsuggest you all smarten yourselves up as\\n much as you can while you are waiting.ﬂ \\n \\n      Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville™s\\n cloak, which was fastened under his left ear, and on Ron™s smudged nose. Harry nervous\\nly tried to flatten his hair.  \\n      ﬁI shall return when we are ready for you,ﬂ said Professor McGonagall. ﬁPlease wait quietly.ﬂ  \\n      She left the chamber. Harry swallowed. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁHow exactly do they sort us into houses?ﬂ he asked Ron. \\n      ﬁSome sort of test, I think. Fred sa\\nid it hurts a lot, but I think he was joking.ﬂ        Harry™s heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of the w\\nhole school? But he didn™t know any magic yet Šwhat on earth would he have to do? \\nHe hadn™t expected something like this the \\nmoment they arrived. He looked around anxiously\\n and saw that everyone else looked terrified, too. No one was talking much except Hermione Gr\\nanger, who was whispering very fast about all the spells she™d learned and wondering which one she™d need. Harry tried hard not to listen to \\nher. He™d never been more nervous, never, not \\neven when he™d had to take a school report home \\nto the Dursleys saying that he™d somehow turned \\nhis teacher™s wig blue. He kept his eyes fixed \\non the door. Any second now, Professor McGonagall would come back and lead him to his \\ndoom. \\n \\n      Then something happened that made him ju\\nmp about a foot in the air Š several people behind him screamed. \\n \\n      ﬁWhat the Š?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      He gasped. So did the people around him. \\nAbout twenty ghosts had just streamed through the \\nback wall. Pearly-white and slightly transparen\\nt, they glided across the room talking to one \\nanother and hardly glancing at the first years. They seemed to be arguing. What looked like a fat \\nlittle monk was saying: ﬁForgive and forget, I \\nsay, we ought to give him a second chance Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁMy dear Friar, haven™t we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He\\n gives us all a bad name \\nand you know, he™s not really even a ghost Š I say, what are you all doing here?ﬂ \\n \\n      A ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years.  \\n      Nobody answered. \\n \\n      ﬁNew students!ﬂ said the Fat Friar, smiling around at them. ﬁAbout to be Sorted, I suppose?ﬂ \\n \\n      A few people nodded mutely. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁHope to see you in Hufflepuff!ﬂ said the Friar. ﬁMy old house, you know.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁMove along now,ﬂ said a sharp voice. ﬁThe Sorting Ceremony™s about to start.ﬂ \\n \\n      Professor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghosts floated away through the opposite \\nwall.  \\n      ﬁNow, form a line,ﬂ Professor McG\\nonagall told the first years, ﬁand follow me.ﬂ \\n \\n      Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall.        Harry had never even imagined such a st\\nrange and splendid place. It was lit by thousands and \\nthousands of candles that were floating in mida\\nir over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting. These tables were laid with\\n glittering golden plates and goblets. At the top of the hall was another long table where the teach\\ners were sitting. Professor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a halt in\\n a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them. The hundreds of faces staring at them\\n looked like pale lanterns in the flickering \\ncandlelight. Dotted here and there among the students, the ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to \\navoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. He heard Hermione whisper, ﬁIts bewitched to\\n look like the sky outside. I read about it in Hogwarts, A History.ﬂ        It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the Great Hall didn™t simply open \\non to the heavens.  \\n      Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed a four-legged stool in front of the first years. On top of the stool sh\\ne put a pointed wizard™s hat. This hat was patched \\nand frayed and extremely dirty. Aunt Pet\\nunia wouldn™t have let it in the house.  \\n      Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly, that seemed the sort of \\nthing Š noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there was complete silence. Then the \\nhat twitched. A rip near the brim opened wide \\nlike a mouth Š and the hat began to sing: \\n  ﬁOh, you may not think I™m pretty,    But don™t judge on what you see, \\n   I™ll eat myself if you can find \\n\\n \\n  A smarter hat than me. \\n\\n \\n  You can keep your bowlers black, \\n\\n \\n  Your top hats sleek and tall, \\n\\n \\n  For I™m the Hogwarts Sorting Hat \\n\\n \\n  And I can cap them all. \\n\\n \\n  There™s nothing hidden in your head \\n\\n \\n  The Sorting Hat can™t see, \\n\\n \\n  So try me on and I will tell you \\n\\n \\n  Where you ought to be. \\n  You might belong in Gryffindor, \\n \\n  Where dwell the brave at heart, \\n\\n \\n  Their daring, nerve, and chivalry \\n\\n \\n  Set Gryffindors apart; \\n\\n \\n  You might belong in Hufflepuff, \\n\\n \\n  Where they are just and loyal, \\n\\n \\n  Those patient Hufflepuffs are true \\n\\n \\n  And unafraid of toil; \\n\\n \\n  Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw, \\n\\n \\n  if you™ve a ready mind, \\n\\n \\n  Where those of wit and learning, \\n\\n \\n  Will always find their kind; \\n\\n \\n  Or perhaps in Slytherin \\n\\n   You™ll make your real friends, \\n \\n  Those cunning folk use any means \\n\\n \\n  To achieve their ends. \\n\\n \\n  So put me on! Don™t be afraid! \\n\\n \\n  And don™t get in a flap! \\n\\n \\n  You™re in safe hands (though I have none) \\n\\n \\n  For I™m a Thinking Cap!ﬂ \\n   The whole hall burst into applause as the hat fini\\nshed its song. It bowed to each of the four tables \\nand then became quite still again. \\n \\n      ﬁSo we™ve just got to try on the hat!ﬂ R\\non whispered to Harry. ﬁI™ll kill Fred, he was going on \\nabout wrestling a troll.ﬂ        Harry smiled weakly. Yes, trying on the hat wa\\ns a lot better than having to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching. The hat seemed to be asking rather a \\nlot; Harry didn™t feel brave or quick-witted or \\nany of it at the moment. If only the hat had \\n\\nmentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for him. \\n \\n      Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment. \\n \\n      ﬁWhen I call your name, you will put on the \\nhat and sit on the stool to be sorted,ﬂ she said. ﬁAbbott, Hannah!ﬂ  \\n      A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbl\\ned out of line, put on the hat, which fell right down \\nover her eyes, and sat down. A moments pause Š \\n \\n      ﬁHUFFLEPUFF!ﬂ shouted the hat. \\n \\n      The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table. \\nHarry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at her. \\n \\n      ﬁBones, Susan!ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁHUFFLEPUFF!ﬂ shouted the hat again, and Susan scuttled off to sit next to Hannah.  \\n      ﬁBoot, Terry!ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁRAVENCLAW!ﬂ \\n       The table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands \\nwith Terry as he joined them. \\n       ﬁBrocklehurst, Mandyﬂ went to Ravencla\\nw too, but ﬁBrown, Lavenderﬂ became the first new \\nGryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; Harry could see Ron™s twin brothers catcalling.  \\n      ﬁBulstrode, Millicentﬂ then became a Slyt\\nherin. Perhaps it was Harry™s imagination, after all \\nhe™d heard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot.  \\n      He was starting to feel definitely sick now. He remembered being picked for teams during gym \\nat his old school. He had always been last to \\nbe chosen, not because he was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him. \\n \\n      ﬁFinch-Fletchley, Justin!ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁHUFFLEPUFF!ﬂ \\n \\n      Sometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted ou\\nt the house at once, but at others it took a little while to decide. ﬁFinnigan, Seamus,ﬂ the sandy-h\\naired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before\\n the hat declared him a Gryffindor. \\n        ﬁGranger, Hermione!ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      Hermione almost ran to the st\\nool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head. \\n \\n      ﬁGRYFFINDOR!ﬂ shouted the hat. Ron groaned. \\n \\n      A horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do when you™re very nervous. What \\nif he wasn™t chosen at all? Wh\\nat if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until \\nProfessor McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and \\nhe™d better get back on the train? \\n \\n      When Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept\\n losing his toad, was called, he fell over on his way \\nto the stool. The hat took a long time to d\\necide with Neville. When it finally shouted, ﬁGRYFFINDOR,ﬂ Neville ran off s\\ntill wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to \\ngive it to ﬁMacDougal, Morag.ﬂ  \\n      Malfoy swaggered forward when his name \\nwas called and got his wish\\n at once: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed, ﬁSLYTHERIN!ﬂ \\n \\n      Malfoy went to join his friends Cra\\nbbe and Goyle, looking pleased with himself. \\n \\n      There weren™t many people left now. ﬁMoonﬂ– \\n, ﬁNottﬂ– , ﬁParkinsonﬂ– , then a pair of twin girls, ﬁPatilﬂ and ﬁPatilﬂ– , then ﬁPer\\nks, Sally-Anneﬂ– , and then, at last Š        ﬁPotter, Harry!ﬂ  \\n      As Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall.  \\n      ﬁPotter, did she say?ﬂ  \\n      ﬁThe Harry Potter?ﬂ   \\n      The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat. He waited.  \\n      ﬁHmm,ﬂ said a small voice in his ear. ﬁDifficu\\nlt. Very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a \\nbad mind either. There™s talent, A my goodness, ye\\ns Š and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that™s interesting– So where shall I put you?ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not Slytherin.  \\n      ﬁNot Slytherin, eh?ﬂ sa\\nid the small voice. ﬁAre you sure? Y\\nou could be great, you know, it™s all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you \\non the way to greatness, no doubt about that Š \\nno? Well, if you™re sure \\nŠ better be GRYFFINDOR!ﬂ \\n      Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall. He took off the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table. He was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled\\n, ﬁWe got Potter! We got Potter!ﬂ Harry sat \\ndown opposite the ghost in the ruff he™d seen earlier. The ghost patted his arm, giving Harry the \\nsudden, horrible feeling he™d just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold water.        He could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest him sat Hagrid, who caught his \\neye and gave him the thumbs up. Harry grinned bac\\nk. And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus\\n Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at once from the card he™d \\ngotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train. Dumbledore™s silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts. Harry spotted Professor Qu\\nirrell, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron. He was looki\\nng very peculiar in a large purple turban.       And now there were only three people left to be sorted. ﬁThomas, Dean,ﬂ a Black boy even taller \\nthan Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table. \\nﬁTurpin, Lisa,ﬂ became a Ravenclaw and then it \\nwas Ron™s turn. He was pale green by now. Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted, ﬁGRYFFINDOR!ﬂ  \\n      Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next to him. \\n \\n      ﬁWell done, Ron, excellent,ﬂ said Percy We\\nasley pompously across Harry as ﬁZabini, Blaise,ﬂ \\nwas made a Slytherin. Professor \\nMcGonagall rolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away.  \\n      Harry looked down at his empty gold plate.\\n He had only just realized how hungry he was. The pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago. \\n       Albus Dumbledore had gotte\\nn to his feet. He was beaming at the students, his arms opened wide, \\nas if nothing could have pleased him \\nmore than to see them all there. \\n       ﬁWelcome,ﬂ he said. ﬁWelcome to a new \\nyear at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak! \\n \\n      ﬁThank you!ﬂ \\n  \\n      He sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered. Harry didn™t know whether to laugh or not.  \\n      ﬁIs he Š a bit mad?ﬂ he asked Percy uncertainly. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁMad?ﬂ said Percy airil\\ny. ﬁHe™s a genius! Best wizard in the world! But he is a bit mad, yes. \\nPotatoes, Harry?ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry™s mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him were now piled with food. He had never seen \\nso many things he liked to eat on one table: \\nroast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb \\nchops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some\\n strange reason, peppermint humbugs. \\n       The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he™d never been allowed to eat as much as he \\nliked. Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted, even if It made him sick. \\nHarry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermint\\ns and began to eat. It was all delicious.        ﬁThat does look good,ﬂ said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching Harry cut up his steak.  \\n      ﬁCan™t you Š?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁI haven™t eaten for nearly five hundred years,ﬂ said the ghost. ﬁI don™t need to, of course, but one does miss it. I don™t think I™ve introduced my\\nself? Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at \\nyour service. Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁI know who you are!ﬂ said Ron suddenly. ﬁMy brothers told me about you Š you™re Nearly \\nHeadless Nick!ﬂ  \\n      ﬁI would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mims\\ny Šﬂ the ghost began stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted.  \\n      ﬁNearly Headless? How can you be \\nnearly headless?ﬂ \\n \\n      Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat\\n wasn™t going at all the way he wanted.  \\n      ﬁLike this\\n,ﬂ he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge. Someone\\n had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it properly. Looking pleased \\nat the stunned looks \\non their faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said, ﬁSo Š new Gryffindors! I \\nhope you™re going to help us win the house championship this year? Gryffindors have never \\n\\ngone so long without winning. Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row! The Bloody Baron™s becoming almost unbearable\\n Š he™s the Slytherin ghost.ﬂ  \\n      Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silv\\ner blood. He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry \\nwas pleased to see, didn™t look too pleased with the seating arrangements. \\n \\n      ﬁHow did he get covered in blood?ﬂ asked Seamus with great interest. \\n \\n      ﬁI™ve never asked,ﬂ said Nearly Headless Nick delicately. \\n \\n      When everyone had eaten as much as they \\ncould, the remains of the food faded from the plates, \\nleaving them sparkling clean as before. A mome\\nnt later the desserts ap\\npeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of, apple \\npies, treacle tarts, chocolate eclairs and jam \\ndoughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-O, rice pudding–   \\n      As Harry helped himself to a treacl\\ne tart, the talk turned to their families. \\n      ﬁI™m half-and-half,ﬂ said Seamus. ﬁMe dad™\\ns a Muggle. Mom didn™t tell \\nhim she was a witch ™til \\nafter they were married. Bit of a nasty shock for him.ﬂ \\n       The others laughed. \\n \\n      ﬁWhat about you, Neville?ﬂ said Ron. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁWell, my gran brought me up and she™s a \\nwitch,ﬂ said Neville, ﬁbut\\n the family thought I was \\nall-Muggle for ages. My Great Uncl\\ne Algie kept trying to catch me\\n off my guard and force some \\nmagic out of me Š he pushed me off the end of\\n Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned Š but nothing happened until I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came \\nround for dinner, and he was \\nhanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles\\n when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a \\nmeringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced Š all the way down the garden and into the \\n\\nroad. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here Š they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you \\n\\nsee. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad.ﬂ \\n \\n      On Harry™s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons (ﬁI \\ndo hope they start right away, there™s so much to learn, I™m \\nparticularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of \\ncourse, it™s supposed to be very difficult Šﬂ; ﬁYou™ll be starting small, just matches into\\n needles and that sort of thing Š ﬂ).  \\n      Harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at the High Table again. Hagrid was \\ndrinking deeply from his goblet. Professor McGo\\nnagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin.  \\n      It happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed t\\neacher looked past Quirrell™s turban straight into \\nHarry™s eyes Š and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Harry™s forehead.  \\n      ﬁOuch!ﬂ Harry clapped a hand to his head. \\n \\n      ﬁWhat is it?ﬂ asked Percy. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁN-nothing.ﬂ \\n \\n      The pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off was the feeling Harry had \\ngotten from the teacher™s \\nlook Š a feeling that he didn™t like Harry at all.  \\n      ﬁWho™s that teacher talking \\nto Professor Quirrell?ﬂ he asked Percy. \\n \\n      ﬁOh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No \\nwonder he™s looking so nervous, that™s Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn™t want to Š everyone knows he™s after Quirrell™s job. Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts, Snape.ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn™t look at him again. \\n      At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again. The hall \\nfell silent. \\n       ﬁAhem Š just a few more words now that we\\n are all fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term \\nnotices to give you.  \\n      ﬁFirst years should note that the forest on \\nthe grounds is forbidden to \\nall pupils. And a few of our \\nolder students would do well to remember that as well.ﬂ \\n \\n      Dumbledore™s twinkling eyes flashe\\nd in the direction of the Weasley twins. \\n \\n      ﬁI have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be \\nused between classes in the corridors. \\n \\n      ﬁQuidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone \\ninterested in playing for their house teams should \\ncontact Madam Hooch. \\n \\n      ﬁAnd finally, I must tell you \\nthat this year, the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death.ﬂ  \\n      Harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did. \\n \\n      ﬁHe™s not serious?ﬂ he muttered to Percy. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁMust be,ﬂ said Percy, frowning at Dumbledo\\nre. ﬁIt™s odd, because he usually gives us a reason \\nwhy we™re not allowed to go somewhere Š the \\nforest™s full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he might have\\n told us prefects, at least.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁAnd now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!ﬂ cried Dumbledore. Harry noticed that the other teachers™ smile\\ns had become rather fixed. \\n \\n      Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get a fly off the end, and a long \\ngolden ribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into \\nwords.  \\n      ﬁEveryone pick their favorite tune,ﬂ said Dumbledore, ﬁand off we go!ﬂ  \\n      And the school bellowed:    ﬁHogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts, \\n\\n \\n  Teach us something please, \\n\\n \\n  Whether we be old and bald \\n\\n \\n  Or young with scabby knees, \\n  Our heads could do with filling \\n \\n  With some interesting stuff, \\n\\n \\n  For now they™re bare and full of air, \\n\\n \\n  Dead flies and bits of fluff, \\n\\n \\n  So teach us things worth knowing, \\n\\n \\n  Bring back what we™ve forgot, \\n\\n \\n  just do your best, we™ll do the rest, \\n\\n \\n  And learn until our brains all rot.ﬂ \\n   Everybody finished the song at di\\nfferent times. At last, only the \\nWeasley twins were left singing \\nalong to a very slow funeral march. Dumbledore c\\nonducted their last few lines with his wand and \\nwhen they had finished, he was one of those who clapped loudest. \\n \\n      ﬁAh, music,ﬂ he said, wiping his eyes. ﬁA magic beyond all we do here! And now, bedtime. Off \\nyou trot!ﬂ  \\n      The Gryffindor first years followed Percy \\nthrough the chattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase. Harry™s legs were li\\nke lead again, but only because he was so tired \\nand full of food. He was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed, or that twice Percy led them through doorways \\nhidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries. They climbed more staircases, yawning and \\n\\ndragging their feet, and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they \\ncame to a sudden halt. \\n \\n      A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them, and as Percy took a step toward \\nthem they started throwing themselves at him. \\n \\n      ﬁPeeves,ﬂ Percy whispered to the first years. ﬁA poltergeist.ﬂ He raised his voice, ﬁPeeves Š show yourself.ﬂ  \\n      A loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered.  \\n      ﬁDo you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      There was a pop, and a little man with wicke\\nd, dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating \\ncross-legged in the air, cl\\nutching the walking sticks.  \\n      ﬁOooooooh!ﬂ he said, with an evil cackle. ﬁIckle Firsties! What fun!ﬂ \\n        He swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked. \\n \\n      ﬁGo away, Peeves, or the Baron™ll hear about this, I mean it!ﬂ barked Percy. \\n \\n      Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on Neville™s head. They heard him zooming away, rattling \\ncoats of armor as he passed. \\n \\n      ﬁYou want to watch out for Peeves,ﬂ said Percy, as they set off again. ﬁThe Bloody Baron™s the only one who can control him, he won™t even\\n listen to us prefects. Here we are.ﬂ \\n \\n      At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress. \\n      ﬁPassword?ﬂ she said. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁCaput Draconis,ﬂ said Percy, and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall. They all scrambled through it Š Neville need\\ned a leg up Š and found themselves in the \\nGryffindor common room, a cozy, round \\nroom full of squashy armchairs. \\n \\n      Percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys\\n through another. At the top of a spiral staircase Š they were obviously in one of the towers Š they found their beds at last: five four-posters hung with deep red, velvet curtains. Their trunks had already been brought up. Too tired to talk much, they pulle\\nd on their pajamas and fell into bed. \\n \\n      ﬁGreat food, isn™t it?ﬂ Ron mu\\nttered to Harry through the hangings. ﬁGet off, Scabbers! He™s chewing my sheets.ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry was going to ask Ron if he™d had any of the treacle tart, but he fe\\nll asleep almost at once.  \\n      Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, b\\necause he had a very strange dream. He was wearing \\nProfessor Quirrell™s turban, which \\nkept talking to him, telling him he\\n must transfer to Slytherin at \\nonce, because it was his destiny. Harry told the turb\\nan he didn™t want to be in Slytherin; it got \\nheavier and heavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully Š and there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with it Š then\\n Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold Š there was a burst of green light and Harry woke, \\n\\nsweating and shaking.  \\n      He rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke next day, he didn™t remember the dream \\nat all.  \\n            \\n CHAPTER EIGHT \\n  The Potions Master  \\n  ﬁThere, look.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁWhere?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁNext to the ta\\nll kid with the red hair.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWearing the glasses?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁDid you see his face?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁDid you see his scar?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      Whispers followed Harry from the moment \\nhe left his dormitory the next day. People lining up \\noutside classrooms stood on tiptoe to\\n get a look at him, or doubl\\ned back to pass him in the \\ncorridors again, staring. Harry wished they wouldn™t, because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes.  \\n      There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different \\non a Friday; some with a \\nvanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump. Then \\nthere were doors that wouldn™t open unless you \\nasked politely, or tickled them in\\n exactly the right place, and door\\ns that weren™t really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending. It was also very hard to remember where anything was, \\nbecause it all seemed to move around a lot. The \\npeople in the portraits kept going to visit each \\nother, and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk. \\n \\n      The ghosts didn™t help, either. It was always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly \\nthrough a door you were trying to open. Nearly Headless Nick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him when\\n you were late for class. He would drop wastepaper baskets \\non your head, pull rugs from under your feet, pe\\nlt you with bits of chalk, or sneak up behind you, \\ninvisible, grab your nose, and screech, ﬁGOT YOUR CONK!ﬂ  \\n      Even worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the caretaker, Argus Filch. Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their \\nvery first morning. Filch found them trying to \\nforce their way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out-of-bounds corridor on the third floor. He wouldn™t believe they were lost, was sure they were trying to \\n\\nbreak into it on purpose, and was threatening to lock them in\\n the dungeons when they were rescued by Professor Quirrell, who was passing. \\n \\n      Filch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris, a scrawny, dust-colored creature with bulging, lamp like \\neyes just like Filch™s. She patrolled the corridors \\nalone. Break a rule in front of her, put just one toe out of line, and she™d whisk off for Filch, who™d appear, wheezing, two seconds later. Filch \\nknew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone (except perhaps the Weasley \\ntwins) and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts. The students all hated him, and it was \\n\\nthe dearest ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a good kick. \\n \\n      And then, once you had managed to find them, there were the classes themselves. There was a \\nlot more to magic, as Harry quickly found \\nout, than waving your wand and saying a few funny words.  \\n      They had to study the night skies through their telescopes every Wednesday at midnight and \\nlearn the names of different star\\ns and the movements of the plan\\nets. Three times a week they \\nwent out to the greenhouses behind the castle \\nto study Herbology, with a dumpy little witch \\ncalled Professor Sprout, where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi, and found out what they were used for. Easily the most boring class was History of Magic, \\nwhich was the only one taught by a ghost. Professor Binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fi\\nre and got up next morning to teach, leaving his \\nbody behind him. Binns droned on and on while th\\ney scribbled down names and dates, and got \\nEmetic the Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up. \\n \\n      Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, wa\\ns a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of their first class he took the roll call, and when he reached Harry™s name he gave an exc\\nited squeak and toppled out of sight. \\n \\n      Professor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been quite right to think she wasn™t a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she gave th\\nem a talking-to the moment they sat down in her \\nfirst class.  \\n      ﬁTransfiguration is some of the most co\\nmplex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts,ﬂ \\nshe said. ﬁAnyone messing around in my class will \\nleave and not come back. You have been \\nwarned.ﬂ  \\n      Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again. They were all \\nvery impressed and couldn™t \\nwait to get started, but soon realized they weren™t going to be changing the furniture into animals \\nfor a long time. After taking a lot of complicated \\nnotes, they were each given a match and started \\ntrying to turn it into a needle. By the end of the lesson, only Hermione Granger had made any \\ndifference to her match; Professor McGonagall s\\nhowed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare smile. \\n \\n      The class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense Against the Dark Arts, but \\nQuirrell™s lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke. His classroom \\nsmelled strongly of garlic, which \\neveryone said was to ward off a vampire he™d \\nmet in Romania and was afraid would be coming \\nback to get him one of these days. His turban, he\\n told them, had been given to him by an African \\nprince as a thank-you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie, but they weren™t sure they \\nbelieved this story. For one thing, when Seamus \\nFinnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had fought off the zombie, Quirrell went\\n pink and started talking about the weather; for another, they had noticed that a funny smell hung \\naround the turban, and the Weasle\\ny twins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went. \\n       Harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn™t miles behind everyone\\n else. Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, ha\\ndn™t had any idea that they were witches and wizards. There was so much to learn that even pe\\nople like Ron didn™t have much of a head start. \\n \\n      Friday was an important day for Harry a\\nnd Ron. They finally managed to find their way down to \\nthe Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost once. \\n \\n      ﬁWhat have we got today?ﬂ Harry \\nasked Ron as he poured sugar on his porridge.  \\n      ﬁDouble Potions with the Slytherins,ﬂ said Ron. ﬁSnape™s Head of Slytherin House. They say he always favors them Š we™ll be able to see if it™s true.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWish McGonagall favored us,ﬂ said Ha\\nrry. Professor McGonagall was head of Gryffindor House, but it hadn™t stopped her from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before. \\n \\n      Just then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten us\\ned to this by now, but it had given him a bit of a \\nshock on the first morning, when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great \\n\\nHall during breakfast, circling the tables until they saw their owners, and dropping letters and packages onto their laps. \\n \\n      Hedwig hadn™t brought Harry anything so far. She sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a \\nbit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls. This morning, \\nhowever, she fluttered down between the marm\\nalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto \\nHarry™s plate. Harry tore it open at on\\nce. It said, in a very untidy scrawl:  \\n    Dear Harry,  \\n  I know you get Friday afternoons off, so woul\\nd you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three?  \\n  I want to hear all abou\\nt your first week. Send us an answer back with Hedwig.  \\n  Hagrid \\n     Harry borrowed Ron™s quill, scribbled \\nYes, please, see you later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again.  \\n      It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid\\n to look forward to, because the Potions lesson turned \\nout to be the worst thing that \\nhad happened to him so far.  \\n      At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten \\nthe idea that Professor Snape disliked him. By the \\nend of the first Potions lesson, he knew he™d been wrong. Snape didn™t dislike Harry Š he hated him. \\n       Potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was colder here than up in the main \\ncastle, and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass \\njars all around the walls. \\n       Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by ta\\nking the roll call, and like Flitwick, he paused at \\nHarry™s name. \\n \\n      ﬁAh, Yes,ﬂ he said softly, ﬁHarry Potter. Our new Š celebrity.ﬂ  \\n      Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their hands. Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class. His eyes were black like Hagrid™s, but they had \\n\\nnone of Hagrid™s warmth. They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels. \\n \\n      ﬁYou are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potionmaking,ﬂ he began. He spoke in \\nbarely more than a whisper, but they caught \\nevery word Š like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort. ﬁAs there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magi\\nc. I don™t expect you will really understand the \\nbeauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its \\nshimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids \\nthat creep through human veins, bewitching th\\ne mind, ensnaring the se\\nnses– I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper \\ndeath Š if you aren™t as big a bunch of \\ndunderheads as I usually have to teach.ﬂ  \\n      More silence followed this little speech. Ha\\nrry and Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows. \\nHermione Granger was on the edge of her seat \\nand looked desperate to start proving that she wasn™t a dunderhead.        ﬁPotter!ﬂ said Snape suddenly. ﬁWhat would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?ﬂ \\n       Powdered root of what to an infusion of what? Harry glanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as \\nhe was; Hermione™s hand had shot into the air. \\n \\n      ﬁI don™t know, sir,ﬂ said Harry. \\n \\n      Snape™s lips curled into a sneer. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁTut, tut Š fame clearly isn™t everything.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      He ignored Hermione™s hand. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁLet™s try again. Potter, where would \\nyou look if I told you to find me a bezoar?ﬂ \\n \\n      Hermione stretched her hand as high into th\\ne air as it would go without her leaving her seat, but Harry didn™t have the faintest idea what a bezoar\\n was. He tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were shaking with laughter.        ﬁI don™t know, sir.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁThought you wouldn™t open a book before coming, eh, Potter?ﬂ Harry forced himself to keep \\nlooking straight into those cold eyes. He had looked through his books at the Dursleys™, but did Snape expect him to remember everything in \\nOne Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi?  \\n      Snape was still ignoring Hermione™s quivering hand. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁWhat is the difference, Po\\ntter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?ﬂ \\n \\n      At this, Hermione stood up, he\\nr hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling.  \\n      ﬁI don™t know,ﬂ said Harry quietly. ﬁI think Hermione does, though, why don™t you try her?ﬂ \\n \\n      A few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus\\n™s eye, and Seamus winked. Snape, however, was \\nnot pleased.  \\n      ﬁSit down,ﬂ he snapped at Hermione. ﬁF\\nor your information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood \\nmake a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as\\n the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and \\nit will save you from most poisons. As for \\nmonkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plan\\nt, which also goes by the name of aconite. \\nWell? Why aren™t you all copying that down?ﬂ \\n \\n      There was a sudden rummaging for quills an\\nd parchment. Over the noise, Snape said, ﬁAnd a \\npoint will be taken from Gryffi\\nndor House for your cheek, Potter.ﬂ \\n       Things didn™t improve for the Gryffindors \\nas the Potions lesson continued. Snape put them all \\ninto pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cu\\nre boils. He swept around in his long black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettle\\ns and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, whom he seemed to like. \\nHe was just telling everyone to look at the \\nperfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud \\nhissing filled the dungeon. Neville had somehow managed to melt Seamus™s cauldron into a \\ntwisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor, bur\\nning holes in people™s shoes. Within seconds, the whole class was standing \\non their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapse\\nd, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up \\nall over his arms and legs. \\n       ﬁIdiot boy!ﬂ snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand. ﬁI suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?ﬂ \\n \\n      Neville whimpered as boils\\n started to pop up all over his nose. \\n \\n      ﬁTake him up to the hospital wing,ﬂ Snape spat at Seamus. Then he\\n rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville.  \\n      ﬁYou Š Potter Š why didn™t you tell him \\nnot to add the quills? Thought he™d make you look \\ngood if he got it wrong, did you? That™s anot\\nher point you™ve lost for Gryffindor.ﬂ        This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron kicked him behind their \\ncauldron.  \\n      ﬁDon™t push it,ﬂ he muttered, ﬁI™ve heard Snape can turn very nasty.ﬂ  \\n      As they climbed the steps out of the \\ndungeon an hour later, Harry™s mind was racing and his spirits were low. He™d lost two points fo\\nr Gryffindor in his very first week Šwhy did Snape hate him so much? \\n \\n      ﬁCheer up,ﬂ said Ron, ﬁSnape™s always taking points off Fred and George. Can I come and meet \\nHagrid with you?ﬂ \\n \\n      At five to three they left the castle and made their way \\nacross the grounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest. A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were \\n\\noutside the front door.  \\n      When Harry knocked they heard a frantic \\nscrabbling from inside and several booming barks. \\nThen Hagrid™s voice rang out, saying, ﬁBack, Fang Šback.ﬂ  \\n      Hagrid™s big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open.  \\n      ﬁHang on,ﬂ he said. ﬁBack, Fang.ﬂ  \\n      He let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound. \\n       There was only one room inside. Hams \\nand pheasants were hanging from the ceiling, a copper \\nkettle was boiling on the open fire, and in the co\\nrner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt \\nover it.  \\n      ﬁMake yerselves at home\\n,ﬂ said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who bounded straight at Ron and started licking his ears. Like Hagrid, Fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked.  \\n      ﬁThis is Ron,ﬂ Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate. \\n \\n      ﬁAnother Weasley, eh?ﬂ said Hagrid, glancing \\nat Ron™s freckles. ﬁI spen\\nt half me life chasin™ yer \\ntwin brothers away from the forest.ﬂ  \\n      The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with \\nraisins that almost broke their teeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told \\nHagrid all about their first lessons. Fang rested \\nhis head on Harry™s knee and drooled all over his robes.  \\n      Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Filch ﬁthat old git.ﬂ \\n       ﬁAn™ as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I™d like ter introduce her to Fang sometime. D™yeh know, every \\ntime I go up ter the school, she follows me everyw\\nhere? Can™t get rid of her Š Filch puts her up \\nto it.ﬂ \\n       Harry told Hagrid about Snape™s lesson. Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students.  \\n      ﬁBut he seemed to really \\nhate me.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁRubbish!ﬂ said Hagrid. ﬁWhy should he?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      Yet Harry couldn™t help thinking that Hagrid didn™t quite meet his eyes when he said that. \\n \\n      ﬁHow™s yer brother Charlie?ﬂ Hagrid asked Ron. ﬁI liked him a lot Š great with animals.ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose. While R\\non told Hagrid all about Charlie™s work with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under \\nthe tea cozy. It was a cutting from the \\nDaily Prophet:    GRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST \\n \\n  Investigations continue into the break-in at Gr\\ningotts on 31 July, widely believed to be the work \\nof Dark wizards or witches unknown. Gringotts goblins today insisted \\nthat nothing had been taken. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day.  \\n  ﬁBut we™re not telling you what \\nwas in there, so keep your noses out if you know what™s good for \\nyou,ﬂ said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon.  \\n  Harry remembered Ron telling him on the train \\nthat someone had tried to rob Gringotts, but Ron \\nhadn™t mentioned the date. \\n \\n      ﬁHagrid!ﬂ said Harry, ﬁthat Gringotts break-in happened on my birthday! It might™ve been \\nhappening while we were there!ﬂ  \\n      There was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn™t meet Harry™s eyes this time. He grunted \\nand offered him another rock cake. Harry read the story again. \\nThe vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. Hagrid had emptied vault \\nseven hundred and thirteen, if you could call it emptying, taking out that grubb\\ny little package. Had that been what the thieves were looking for? \\n \\n      As Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their pockets weighed down with rock \\ncakes they™d been too polite to refuse, Harry thought that none of the lessons he™d had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with Ha\\ngrid. Had Hagrid collected that package just in time? Where was it now? And did Hagrid know some\\nthing about Snape that he didn™t want to tell Harry? \\n CHAPTER NINE \\n  The Midnight Duel  \\n  Harry had never believed he would meet a boy he\\n hated more than Dudley, but that was before \\nhe met Draco Malfoy. Still, first-year Gryffindors \\nonly had Potions with the Slytherins, so they \\ndidn™t have to put up with Malfoy much. Or at least, they didn™t until they spotted a notice \\npinned up in the Gryffindor common room that \\nmade them all groan. Flying lessons would be \\n\\nstarting on Thursday Š and Gryffindor a\\nnd Slytherin would be learning together.  \\n      ﬁTypical,ﬂ said Harry darkly. ﬁJust what I always wanted. To make\\n a fool of myself on a \\nbroomstick in front of Malfoy.ﬂ \\n \\n      He had been looking forward to learning to fly more \\nthan anything else.  \\n      ﬁYou don™t know that you™ll make a fool \\nof yourself,ﬂ said Ron reasonably. ﬁAnyway, I know Malfoy™s always going on about how good he is at Quidditch, but I bet \\nthat™s all talk.ﬂ  \\n      Malfoy certainly did talk about flying a lot. He complained loudly about first years never getting \\non the house Quidditch teams and told long, boastful \\nstories that always seemed to end with him \\nnarrowly escaping Muggles in helicopters. He wasn™t the only one, though: the way Seamus \\nFinnigan told it, he™d spent most of his childhood zooming \\naround the countryside on his \\nbroomstick. Even Ron would tell anyone who™d li\\nsten about the time he™d almost hit a hang \\nglider on Charlie™s old broom. Everyone from\\n wizarding families talked about Quidditch \\nconstantly. Ron had already had a big argument w\\nith Dean Thomas, who sh\\nared their dormitory, \\nabout soccer. Ron couldn™t see what was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one \\nwas allowed to fly. Harry had caught Ron prodding Dean™s poster of West Ham soccer team, \\n\\ntrying to make the players move. \\n \\n      Neville had never been on a broomstick in \\nhis life, because his grandmother had never let him \\nnear one. Privately, Harry felt she™d had good reason, because Neville managed to have an \\nextraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground. \\n \\n      Hermione Granger was almost as nervous \\nabout flying as Neville was. This was something you \\ncouldn™t learn by heart out of a book Š not that she hadn™t tried. At breakfast on Thursday she bored them all stupid with flying tips \\nshe™d gotten out of a library book called Quidditch Through the Ages. Neville was hanging on to her every word, desperate for anything that might \\nhelp him hang on to his broomstick later, but ev\\nerybody else was very pleased when Hermione™s \\nlecture was interrupted by \\nthe arrival of the mail. \\n \\n      Harry hadn™t had a single letter since Hagrid™s note, something that Malfoy had been quick to \\nnotice, of course. Malfoy™s eagle owl was always bringing him packages of sweets from home, \\nwhich he opened gloatingly at the Slytherin table.  \\n      A barn owl brought Neville a small package from his grandmother. He opened it excitedly and \\nshowed them a glass ball the size of a large marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke. \\n       ﬁIt™s a Remembrall!ﬂ he explained. ﬁGran \\nknows I forget things Š this tells you if there™s \\nsomething you™ve forgotten to do. Look, you hold it \\ntight like this and if it turns red Š oh–ﬂ His face fell, because the Remembrall had sudden\\nly glowed scarlet, ﬁ– you™ve forgotten \\nsomething–ﬂ \\n \\n      Neville was trying to remember what he\\n™d forgotten when Draco Malfoy, who was passing the \\nGryffindor table, snatched the Remembrall out of his hand. \\n \\n      Harry and Ron jumped to their feet. They\\n were half hoping for a reason to fight Malfoy, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot trouble quic\\nker than any teacher in the school, was there \\nin a flash.  \\n      ﬁWhat™s going on?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁMalfoy™s got my Remembrall, Professor.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      Scowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table. \\n \\n      ﬁJust looking,ﬂ he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle behind him. \\n   At three-thirty that aftern\\noon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson. It was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the slopi\\nng lawns toward a smooth, flat lawn on the \\nopposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying darkly in the \\ndistance. \\n       The Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the \\nground. Harry had heard Fred and George Weasle\\ny complain about the school brooms, saying \\nthat some of them started to vibrate if you flew\\n too high, or always flew\\n slightly to the left.  \\n      Their teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, gray hair, and yellow eyes like a hawk.  \\n      ﬁWell, what are you all waiting for?ﬂ sh\\ne barked. ﬁEveryone stand by a broomstick. Come on, \\nhurry up.ﬂ  \\n      Harry glanced down at his broom. It was old and some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁStick out your right hand over your broom,ﬂ\\n called Madam Hooch at the front, ﬁand say ‚Up!™ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁUPﬂ everyone shouted. \\n \\n      Harry™s broom jumped into his hand at \\nonce, but it was one of the few that did. Hermione \\nGranger™s had simply rolled over on the ground, a\\nnd Neville™s hadn™t moved at all. Perhaps \\nbrooms, like horses, could tell when you were\\n afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Neville™s voice that said only too clearly that\\n he wanted to keep his feet on the ground. \\n       Madam Hooch then showed them how to \\nmount their brooms without sliding off the end, and \\nwalked up and down the rows correcting their grips. Harry and Ron were delighted when she \\ntold Malfoy he™d been doing it wrong for years.  \\n      ﬁNow, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard,ﬂ said Madam Hooch. ﬁKeep \\nyour brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then \\ncome straight back down by leaning forward \\nslightly. On my whistle Š three Š two Šﬂ  \\n      But Neville, nervous and jumpy and fri\\nghtened of being left on the ground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hooch™s lips. \\n \\n      ﬁCome back, boy!ﬂ she shouted, but Neville wa\\ns rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle Š twelve feet Š twenty feet. Harry saw his sc\\nared white face look down at the ground falling \\naway, saw him gasp, slip sideways off the broom and Š \\n \\n      WHAM Š a thud and a nasty crack and \\nNeville lay facedown on the grass in a heap. His \\nbroomstick was still rising higher and higher, and \\nstarted to drift lazily toward the forbidden \\nforest and out of sight.  \\n      Madam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as his. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁBroken wrist,ﬂ Harry heard her mutter. ﬁCome on, boy Š it™s all right, up you get.ﬂ \\n \\n      She turned to the rest of the class.        ﬁNone of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You leave those brooms \\nwhere they are or you™ll be out of Hogwarts before you can say ‚Quidditch.™ Come on, dear.ﬂ \\n \\n      Neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her \\narm around him. \\n \\n      No sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into laughter.  \\n      ﬁDid you see his face, the great lump?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      The other Slytherins joined in. \\n \\n      ﬁShut up, Malfoy,ﬂ snapped Parvati Patil. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁOoh, sticking up for Longbottom?ﬂ said Pansy Parkinson, a hard-faced \\nSlytherin girl. ﬁNever thought you™d\\n like fat little crybabies, Parvati.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁLook!ﬂ said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching something out of the grass. ﬁIt™s that stupid thing Longbottom™s gran sent him.ﬂ \\n      The Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up. \\n \\n      ﬁGive that here, Malfoy,ﬂ said Harry quietly. Everyone stopped talking to watch.  \\n      Malfoy smiled nastily. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁI think I™ll leave it somewhere \\nfor Longbottom to find Š how about Š up a tree?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁGive it here!ﬂ Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick and taken off. He hadn™t \\nbeen lying, he could fly well. Hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he called, \\nﬁCome and get it, Potter!ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry grabbed his broom. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁNo!ﬂ shouted Hermione Granger. ﬁMadam Hooch told\\n us not to move Š you™ll get us all into trouble.ﬂ   \\n      Harry ignored her. Blood was pounding in his ears. He mounted the broom and kicked hard \\nagainst the ground and up, up he soared; air rushed through his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him Š and in a rush of fierce joy he real\\nized he™d found something he could do without \\n\\nbeing taught Š this was easy, this was wonderful. He pulled his broomstick up a little to take it \\neven higher, and heard screams and gasps of\\n girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop \\nfrom Ron. \\n \\n      He turned his broomstick sharply \\nto face Malfoy in midair. Malfoy looked stunned. \\n       ﬁGive it here,ﬂ Harry called, ﬁor I™ll knock you off that broom!ﬂ \\n       ﬁOh, yeah?ﬂ said Malfoy, \\ntrying to sneer, but looking worried.  \\n      Harry knew, somehow, what to do. He lean\\ned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both \\nhands, and it shot toward Malfoy like a javelin. Malfoy only just got out of the way in time; \\nHarry made a sharp about-face and held the \\nbroom steady. A few peopl\\ne below were clapping.  \\n      ﬁNo Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Ma\\nlfoy,ﬂ Harry called.  \\n      The same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁCatch it if you can, then!ﬂ he shouted, and he threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the ground.  \\n      Harry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball ri\\nse up in the air and then start to fall. He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down Š next\\n second he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball Š wind whistled in his ears, mingled with \\nthe screams of people watching \\nŠ he stretched out his hand Š a foot from the gr\\nound he caught it, just in time to pull his broom \\nstraight, and he toppled gently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in his fist. \\n      ﬁHARRY POTTER!ﬂ \\n \\n      His heart sank faster than he™d just dived. Professor McGonagall was running toward them. He \\ngot to his feet, trembling. \\n \\n      ﬁNever Š in all my time at Hogwarts Šﬂ \\n  \\n      Professor McGonagall was almost speechless \\nwith shock, and her glasses flashed furiously, ﬁŠ \\nhow dare you Š might have broken your neck Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁIt wasn™t his fault, Professor Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁBe quiet, Miss Patil Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁBut Malfoy Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁThat™s enough, Mr. Weasley. Potter, follow me, now.ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle™s triumphant faces as he left, walking numbly \\nin Professor McGonagall™s wake as she strode toward the castle. He was going to be expelled, he just knew it. He wanted to say something to de\\nfend himself, but there seemed to be something \\nwrong with his voice. Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him; \\nhe had to jog to keep up. Now he™d done it. He hadn™t even lasted two weeks. He™d be packing his bags in ten minutes. What would the Durs\\nleys say when he turned up on the doorstep? \\n \\n      Up the front steps, up the marble stair\\ncase inside, and still Professor McGonagall didn™t say a word to him. She wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with Harry trotting \\nmiserably behind her. Maybe she \\nwas taking him to Dumbledore. \\nHe thought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper. Perhaps \\nhe could be Hagrid™s assistant. His stomach \\ntwisted as he imagined it, watching Ron and \\nthe others becoming wizards, while he stumped \\n\\naround the grounds carrying Hagrid™s bag.  \\n      Professor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom. She opene\\nd the door and poked her head inside.  \\n      ﬁExcuse me, Professor Flitw\\nick, could I borrow Wood for a moment?ﬂ \\n \\n      Wood? thought Harry, bewildered; wa\\ns Wood a cane she was going to use on him? \\n \\n      But Wood turned out to be a person, a burly\\n fifth-year boy who came out of Flitwick™s class \\nlooking confused. \\n \\n      ﬁFollow me, you two,ﬂ said Professor McGo\\nnagall, and they marched \\non up the corridor, Wood \\nlooking curiously at Harry.  \\n      ﬁIn here.ﬂ       Professor McGonagall pointed them into a \\nclassroom that was empty except for Peeves, who was \\nbusy writing rude words on the blackboard. \\n       ﬁOut, Peeves!ﬂ she barked. Peeves threw the chalk into a bin, which clanged loudly, and he swooped out cursing. Professor McGonagall slamme\\nd the door behind him and turned to face the \\ntwo boys.  \\n      ﬁPotter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood Š I™ve found you a Seeker.ﬂ \\n \\n      Wood™s expression cha\\nnged from puzzlement to delight. \\n \\n      ﬁAre you serious, Professor?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁAbsolutely,ﬂ said Professor McGonagall crisply. ﬁThe boy™s a natural. I™ve never seen anything like it. Was that your first time on a broomstick, Potter?ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry nodded silently. He didn™t have a clue what was going on, but he didn™t seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling started coming back to his legs. \\n \\n      ﬁHe caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot dive,ﬂ Professor McGonagall told Wood. \\nﬁDidn™t even scratch himself. Char\\nlie Weasley couldn™t have done it.ﬂ \\n \\n      Wood was now looking as though \\nall his dreams had co\\nme true at once.  \\n      ﬁEver seen a game of Qu\\nidditch, Potter?ﬂ he asked excitedly.        ﬁWood™s captain of the Gryffind\\nor team,ﬂ Professor McGonagall explained. \\n       ﬁHe™s just the build for \\na Seeker, too,ﬂ said Wood, now walking around Harry and staring at him. ﬁLight Šspeedy Š we™ll have to get him a d\\necent broom, Professor Š a Nimbus Two Thousand \\nor a Cleansweep Seven, I™d say.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁI shall speak to Professor Dumbledore a\\nnd see if we can™t bend the first-year rule. Heaven knows, we need a better team than last year. \\nFlattened\\n in that last match \\nby Slytherin, I couldn™t look Severus Snape in the face for weeks–ﬂ \\n \\n      Professor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at Harry.  \\n      ﬁI want to hear you™re training hard, Potter, or I may change my mind about punishing you.ﬂ \\n \\n      Then she suddenly smiled. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁYour father would have been proud,ﬂ she said. ﬁHe was an excellent Quidditch player himself.ﬂ \\n \\n  ﬁYou™re \\njoking\\n.ﬂ        It was dinnertime. Harry had just finished\\n telling Ron what had happened when he™d left the grounds with Professor McGonagall. Ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he™d forgotten all about it.        ﬁSeeker?ﬂ he said. ﬁBut first years never Š you must be the youngest \\nhouse player in about Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁ Š a century,ﬂ said Harry, shoveling pie into his mouth. He felt par\\nticularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon. ﬁWood told me.ﬂ \\n \\n      Ron was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped at Harry. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁI start training next week,ﬂ said Harry. ﬁOnly don™t tell anyone, Wood want\\ns to keep it a secret.ﬂ  \\n      Fred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry, and hurried over. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁWell done,ﬂ said George in a low voi\\nce. ﬁWood told us. We™re on the team too Š Beaters.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁI tell you, we™re going to win that Quidditch cup for sure this year,ﬂ said Fred. ﬁWe haven™t won since Charlie left, but this year™s team \\nis going to be brilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping when he told us.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁAnyway, we™ve got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he™s found a new secret passageway out of the school.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁBet it™s that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy \\nthat we found in our first week. See you.ﬂ  \\n      Fred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up: Malfoy, \\nflanked by Crabbe and Goyle.  \\n      ﬁHaving a last meal, Potter? When \\nare you getting the train back to the Muggles?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁYou™re a lot braver now that you™re back on the ground and you™ve got your little friends with you,ﬂ said Harry coolly. There was of course nothing \\nat all little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table was full of teachers, neither of them could do more than crack their knuckles and \\nscowl.  \\n      ﬁI™d take you on anytime on my own,ﬂ \\nsaid Malfoy. ﬁTonight, if you want. Wizard™s duel. \\nWands only Š no contact. What™s the matter? \\nNever heard of a wizard™s duel before, I suppose?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁOf course he has,ﬂ said Ron, wheeling around. ﬁI™m his second, who™s yours?ﬂ \\n \\n      Malfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up.        ﬁCrabbe,ﬂ he said. ﬁMidnight all right? We™ll meet you in\\n the trophy room; that™s always \\nunlocked.ﬂ         When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁWhat is a wizard™s duel?ﬂ said \\nHarry. ﬁAnd what do you mean, you™re my second?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWell, a second™s there to \\ntake over if you die,ﬂ said Ron casually, getting started at last on his cold pie. Catching the look on Harry™s face, he \\nadded quickly, ﬁBut people only die in proper \\nduels, you know, with real wizards. The most you and Malfoy™ll be \\nable to do is send sparks at each other. Neither of you knows enough magic to \\ndo any real damage. I bet he expected you to \\nrefuse, anyway.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁAnd what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁThrow it away and punch him on the nose,ﬂ Ron suggested. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁExcuse me.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      They both looked up. It was Hermione Granger. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁCan™t a person eat in peace in this place?ﬂ said Ron.  \\n      Hermione ignored him and spoke to Harry. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁI couldn™t help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁBet you could,ﬂ Ron muttered. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁŠ and you mustn™t go wandering around the school at night, think of the points you™ll lose \\nGryffindor if you™re caught, and you™re bound to be. It™s really very selfish of you.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁAnd it™s really none of your business,ﬂ said Harry.  \\n      ﬁGood-bye,ﬂ said Ron. \\n \\n    All the same, it wasn™t what you™d call the pe\\nrfect end to the day, Harry thought, as he lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus falling asleep (Neville wasn™t back from the hospital \\nwing). Ron had spent all evening giving him advice su\\nch as ﬁIf he tries to curse you, you™d better dodge it, because I can™t remember how to block them.ﬂ There was a very good chance they \\n\\nwere going to get caught by Filch or Mrs. Norris, and Harry felt he was pushing his luck, \\nbreaking another school rule today. On the other hand, Malfoy™s sneering face kept looming up \\nout of the darkness Š this was his big chance to beat Malfoy face-to-face. He couldn™t miss it. \\n \\n      ﬁHalf-past eleven,ﬂ Ron muttered at last, ﬁwe™d better go.ﬂ \\n       They pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their wands, and crept across the tower room, down \\nthe spiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor common room. A few embers were still glowing in \\nthe fireplace, turning all the armchairs into hunche\\nd black shadows. They had almost reached the \\nportrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them, ﬁI can™t \\nbelieve you™re going to do this, Harry.ﬂ        A lamp flickered on. It was Hermione\\n Granger, wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown.  \\n      ﬁYou!ﬂ said Ron furiously. ﬁGo back to bed!ﬂ  \\n      ﬁI almost told your brother,ﬂ Hermione \\nsnapped, ﬁPercy Š he™s a prefect, he™d put a stop to this.ﬂ  \\n      Harry couldn™t believe anyone could be so interfering. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁCome on,ﬂ he said to Ron. He pushed ope\\nn the portrait of the Fat Lady and climbed through the \\nhole.  \\n      Hermione wasn™t going to give up that\\n easily. She followed Ron through the portrait hole, hissing at them like an angry goose. \\n \\n      ﬁDon™t you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about yourselves, I don™t want Slytherin to win the house cup, and you™ll lose all the points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing \\nabout Switching Spells.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁGo away.ﬂ        ﬁAll right, but I warned you, you just reme\\nmber what I said when you™re on the train home \\ntomorrow, you™re so Šﬂ \\n \\n      But what they were, they didn™t find out. Hermione had turned to the \\nportrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty painting. The Fat Lady had gone on a \\nnighttime visit and Hermione was \\nlocked out of Gryffindor tower.  \\n      ﬁNow what am I going to do?ﬂ she asked shrilly. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁThat™s your problem,ﬂ said Ron. ﬁWe™ve got to go, we™re going to be late.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      They hadn™t even reached the end of the corridor when Hermione caught up with them. \\n \\n      ﬁI™m coming with you,ﬂ she said. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁYou are not.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁD™you think I™m going to st\\nand out here and wait for Filch to catch me? If he finds all three of \\nus I™ll tell him the truth, that I was trying to stop you, and you can back me up.ﬂ \\n      ﬁYou™ve got some nerve Šﬂ said Ron loudly. \\n \\n      ﬁShut up, both of you!ﬂ said Harry sharply. ﬁI heard something.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      It was a sort of snuffling. \\n \\n      ﬁMrs. Norris?ﬂ breathe\\nd Ron, squinting through the dark.  \\n      It wasn™t Mrs. Norris. It was Neville. He was curled up on the floor, fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer. \\n \\n      ﬁThank goodness you found me! I™ve been out \\nhere for hours, I couldn™t remember the new \\npassword to get in to bed.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁKeep your voice down, Neville. The passwor\\nd™s ‚Pig snout™ but it won™t help you now, the Fat \\nLady™s gone off somewhere.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁHow™s your arm?ﬂ said Harry. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁFine,ﬂ said Neville, showing them. ﬁMadam Pomfrey mended it in about a minute.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁGood Š well, look, Neville, we™ve got\\n to be somewhere, we™ll see you later Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁDon™t leave me!ﬂ said Neville, scrambling \\nto his feet, ﬁI don™t want to stay here alone, the Bloody Baron™s been past twice already.ﬂ        Ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and Neville. \\n \\n      ﬁIf either of you get us caught, I™ll never rest until I™ve learned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about, and used it on you.ﬂ  \\n      Hermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell \\nRon exactly how to use the Curse of the Bogies, but \\nHarry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all forward.  \\n      They flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the \\nhigh windows. At every turn Harry expected to run into Filch or Mrs. Norris, but they were lucky. They sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy room.  \\n      Malfoy and Crabbe weren™t there yet. The crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight \\ncaught them. Cups, shields, plates, and statues winked silver and gold in the darkness. They edged along the walls, keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room. Harry took out \\nhis wand in case Malfoy leapt in and st\\narted at once. The minutes crept by. \\n \\n      ﬁHe™s late, maybe he™s chickened out,ﬂ Ron whispered. \\n\\n \\n      Then a noise in the next room made them \\njump. Harry had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak Š and it wasn™t Malfoy. \\n       ﬁSniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a corner.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      It was Filch speaking to Mrs. Norris. Horror-struck, Harry waved madl\\ny at the other three to \\nfollow him as quickly as possible;\\n they scurried silently toward the door, away from Filch™s \\nvoice. Neville™s robes had barely whipped round the corner when they heard Filch enter the trophy room. \\n \\n      ﬁThey™re in here somewhere,ﬂ \\nthey heard him mutter, ﬁprobably hiding.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁThis way!ﬂ Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, they began to creep down a long gallery \\nfull of suits of armor. They could hear Filch ge\\ntting nearer. Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run he tripped, grabbed Ron around the waist, and the pair of them \\ntoppled right into a suit of armor. \\n \\n      The clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle. \\n \\n      ﬁRUN!ﬂ Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the gallery, not looking back to see whether Filch was following Š they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor \\n\\nthen another, Harry in the lead, without any idea where they were or where they were going Š they ripped through a tapestry and found themselv\\nes in a hidden passageway, hurtled along it and \\ncame out near their Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy room. \\n \\n      ﬁI think we™ve lost him,ﬂ Harry panted, \\nleaning against the cold wa\\nll and wiping his forehead. Neville was bent double, wheezing and spluttering. \\n \\n      ﬁI Štold\\n Š you,ﬂ Hermione gasped, clutching at the \\nstitch in her chest, ﬁI Š told Š you.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁWe™ve got to get back to Gryffindor tower,ﬂ said Ron, ﬁquickly as possible.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁMalfoy tricked you,ﬂ Hermione said to Ha\\nrry. ﬁYou realize that, don™t you? He was never going \\nto meet you Š Filch knew someone was going to \\nbe in the trophy room, Malfoy must have \\ntipped him off.ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry thought she was probably right, but he wasn™t going to tell her that.  \\n      ﬁLet™s go.ﬂ \\n \\n      It wasn™t going to be that simple. Th\\ney hadn™t gone more than a dozen paces when a doorknob \\nrattled and something came shooting out\\n of a classroom in front of them. \\n \\n      It was Peeves. He caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁShut up, Peeves Š please Š you™ll get us thrown out.ﬂ        Peeves cackled.  \\n      ﬁWandering around at midnight, Ickle Firs\\nties? Tut, tut, tut. \\nNaughty, naughty, you™ll get caughty.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁNot if you don™t give us away, Peeves, please.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁShould tell Filch, I should,ﬂ said Peeves in a saintly voice, but his eyes glittered wickedly. ﬁIt™s for your own good, you know.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁGet out of the way,ﬂ snapped Ron, taking a swipe at Peeves this was a big mistake. \\n \\n      ﬁSTUDENTS OUT OF BED!ﬂ Peeves bellowed, ﬁSTUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE \\nCHARMS CORRIDOR!ﬂ  \\n      Ducking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a door Š and it was locked. \\n \\n      ﬁThis is it!ﬂ Ron moaned, as they pushed \\nhelplessly at the door, ﬁWe™re\\n done for! This is the end!ﬂ  \\n       They could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as he could toward Peeves™s shouts. \\n \\n      ﬁOh, move over,ﬂ Hermione snarled. She \\ngrabbed Harry™s wand, tapped the lock, and whispered, ﬁAlohomora!ﬂ        The lock clicked and the door swung open Š \\nthey piled through it, shut it quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening.        ﬁWhich way did they go, Peeves?ﬂ Filch was saying. ﬁQuick, tell me.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁSay ‚please.™ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁDon™t mess with me, Peeves, now \\nwhere did they go?ﬂ  \\n      ﬁShan™t say nothing if you don™t say please,ﬂ said Peeves in his annoying singsong voice.  \\n      ﬁAll right Šplease.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁNOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I woul\\ndn™t say nothing if you didn™t say please! Ha ha! \\nHaaaaaa!ﬂ And they heard the sound of Peeves \\nwhooshing away and Filch cursing in rage.  \\n      ﬁHe thinks this door is locked,ﬂ Harry whispered. ﬁI think we™ll be okay Š get off\\n, Neville!ﬂ For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of \\nHarry™s bathrobe for the last minute. ﬁ\\nWhat?ﬂ  \\n      Harry turned around Š and saw, quite clearly, what. For a moment, he was sure he™d walked \\ninto a nightmare Š this was too much, on top \\nof everything that had happened so far.        They weren™t in a room, as he had suppose\\nd. They were in a corridor. The forbidden corridor on the third floor. And now they knew why it was forbidden.  \\n      They were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had three heads. Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, \\ntwitching and quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery \\n\\nropes from yellowish fangs. \\n \\n      It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, a\\nnd Harry knew that the only reason they weren™t already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was no mist\\naking what those thunderous growls meant. \\n \\n      Harry groped for the doorknob Š between Filch and death, he™d take Filch. \\n \\n      They fell backward Š Harry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they almost flew, back down \\nthe corridor. Filch must have hurried off to l\\nook for them somewhere else, because they didn™t \\nsee him anywhere, but they hardly cared Š all \\nthey wanted to do was put as much space as \\npossible between them and that monster. They di\\ndn™t stop running until they reached the portrait \\nof the Fat Lady on the seventh floor.  \\n      ﬁWhere on earth have you all been?ﬂ sh\\ne asked, looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces. \\n \\n      ﬁNever mind that Š pig snout, pig snout,ﬂ\\n panted Harry, and the portrait swung forward. They scrambled into the common room and collapsed, trembling, into armchairs. \\n \\n      It was a while before any of them said anything. Neville, indeed, looked as if he™d never speak \\nagain.  \\n      ﬁWhat do they think they™r\\ne doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school?ﬂ said Ron finally. ﬁIf any dog needs exercise, that one does.ﬂ  \\n      Hermione had got both her breath and her \\nbad temper back again. ﬁYou don™t use your eyes, any \\nof you, do you?ﬂ she snapped. ﬁDidn™t \\nyou see what it was standing on?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁThe floor?ﬂ Harry suggest\\ned. ﬁI wasn™t looking at its feet, I was too busy with its heads.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁNo, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It™s obviously guarding something.ﬂ \\n \\n      She stood up, glaring at them.  \\n\\n \\n      ﬁI hope you™re pleased with yourselves. We \\ncould all have been killed Š or worse, expelled. Now, if you don™t mind, I™m going to bed.ﬂ \\n       Ron stared after her, his mouth open. \\n \\n      ﬁNo, we don™t mind,ﬂ he said. ﬁYou™d think we dragged her along, wouldn™t you.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      But Hermione had given Harry something else\\n to think about as he climbed back into bed. The \\ndog was guarding something– What had Hagrid sa\\nid? Gringotts was the \\nsafest place in the world for something you wanted to hide Š except perhaps Hogwarts. \\n \\n      It looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby little package from vault seven \\nhundred and thirteen was.  \\n          \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n CHAPTER TEN   Halloween \\n \\n  Malfoy couldn™t believe his eyes when he saw that\\n Harry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful. Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three-headed dog had been an excellent \\nadventure, and they were quite keen to have another one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in\\n about the package that seemed to have been \\nmoved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection.  \\n      ﬁIt™s either really valuab\\nle or really dangerous,ﬂ said Ron.  \\n      ﬁOr both,ﬂ said Harry. \\n \\n      But as all they knew for sure about the my\\nsterious object was that it was about two inches long, \\nthey didn™t have much chance of guessi\\nng what it was without further clues.  \\n      Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the \\nslightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and \\nthe trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going near the dog again.  \\n      Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harr\\ny and Ron, but she was such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus. All they rea\\nlly wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later. \\n       As the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyone™s attention was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech owls. Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this\\n large parcel, and was amazed wh\\nen the owls soared down and \\ndropped it right in front of him, \\nknocking his bacon to the floor. They had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel.        Harry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it said: \\n\\n   DO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE. \\n \\n      It contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I don™t want everybody knowing you™ve got a broomstick or they™ll all want one. Oliver Wood w\\nill meet you tonight on th\\ne Quidditch field at seven o™clock for your first training session. \\n   \\n      Professor McGonagall     Harry had difficulty hiding his glee \\nas he handed the note to Ron to read.  \\n      ﬁA Nimbus Two Thousand!ﬂ Ro\\nn moaned enviously. \\nﬁI™ve never even \\ntouched one.ﬂ        They left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private before their first class, \\nbut halfway across the entrance hall they found the way upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy seized the package \\nfrom Harry and felt it. \\n       ﬁThat™s a broomstick,ﬂ he said, throwing it b\\nack to Harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on \\nhis face. ﬁYou™ll be in for it this time, Po\\ntter, first years aren™t allowed them.ﬂ \\n \\n      Ron couldn™t resist it. \\n \\n      ﬁIt™s not any old broomstick,ﬂ he said, \\nﬁit™s a Nimbus Two Thousand. What did you say you™ve \\ngot at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?ﬂ Ron \\ngrinned at Harry. ﬁComets look flashy, but \\nthey™re not in the same league as the Nimbus.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWhat would you know about it, Weasley, yo\\nu couldn™t afford half the handle,ﬂ Malfoy snapped back. ﬁI suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig.ﬂ  \\n      Before Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at Malfoy™s elbow.  \\n      ﬁNot arguing, I hope, boys?ﬂ he squeaked. \\n \\n      ﬁPotter™s been sent a broomstick, Professor,ﬂ said Malfoy quickly.  \\n      ﬁYes, yes, that™s right,ﬂ said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Harry. \\nﬁProfessor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstance\\ns, Potter. And what model is it?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁA Nimbus Two Thousand, it is,ﬂ said Ha\\nrry, fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on Malfoy™s face. ﬁAnd it™s really thanks to \\nMalfoy here that I™ve got it,ﬂ he added. \\n \\n      Harry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at Malfoy™s obvious rage and confusion.  \\n      ﬁWell, it™s true,ﬂ Harry chortled as they \\nreached the top of the marble staircase, ﬁIf he hadn™t \\nstolen Neville™s Re\\nmembrall I wouldn™t be on the team–ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁSo I suppose you think that™s a reward for breaking rules?ﬂ came an angry voice from just \\nbehind them. Hermione was stomping up the stai\\nrs, looking disapprovingly at the package in Harry™s hand.  \\n      ﬁI thought you weren™t speaking to us?ﬂ said Harry. \\n \\n      ﬁYes, don™t stop now,ﬂ said Ron, ﬁit™s doing us so much good.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      Hermione marched away with her nose in the air. \\n\\n \\n      Harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons th\\nat day. It kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying un\\nder his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he™d be learning to play that night. He bolted his di\\nnner that evening without noticing what he was eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap the Nimbus Two Thousand at last.        ﬁWow,ﬂ Ron sighed, as the \\nbroomstick rolled onto \\nHarry™s bedspread.  \\n      Even Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it looked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long ta\\nil of neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two \\nThousand written in gold near the top.  \\n      As seven o™clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the Quidditch field. Held never been inside the stadium before. Hundreds of seat\\ns were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on. At either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end. They reminded Harry \\nof the little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high.  \\n      Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Ha\\nrry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the \\nground. What a feeling Š he swooped in and out \\nof the goal posts and then sped up and down the field. The Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he wanted at\\n his lightest touch.  \\n      ﬁHey, Potter, come down!ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      Oliver Wood had arrived. He was carrying \\na large wooden crate under his arm. Harry landed \\nnext to him. \\n \\n      ﬁVery nice,ﬂ said Wood, his eyes glinting. ﬁI see what McGonagall meant– you really are a natural. I™m just going to teach you the rules th\\nis evening, then you™ll be joining team practice \\nthree times a week.ﬂ \\n \\n      He opened the crate. Inside were four different-sized balls.  \\n      ﬁRight,ﬂ said Wood. ﬁNow, Quidditch is eas\\ny enough to understand, even if it™s not too easy to play. There are seven players on each si\\nde. Three of them are called Chasers.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁThree Chasers,ﬂ Harry repeated, as Wood t\\nook out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball.  \\n      ﬁThis ball™s called the Quaffle,ﬂ said Wood. \\nﬁThe Chasers throw the Quaffle to each other and \\ntry and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal. Ten points every time the Quaffle goes \\nthrough one of the hoops. Follow me?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁThe Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score,ﬂ Harry recited. ﬁSo Š that™s sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops, isn™t it?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWhat™s basketba\\nll?ﬂ said Wood curiously. \\n       ﬁNever mind,ﬂ said Harry quickly. \\n \\n      ﬁNow, there™s another player on each \\nside who™s called the Keeper Š I™m Keeper for \\nGryffindor. I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁThree Chasers, one Keeper,ﬂ said Harry, who was determined to remember it all. ﬁAnd they \\nplay with the Quaffle. Okay, got that. So what are they for?ﬂ He pointed at the three balls left \\ninside the box.  \\n      ﬁI™ll show you now,ﬂ said Wood. ﬁTake this.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      He handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁI™m going to show you what the Bludgers do,ﬂ Wood said. ﬁThese two are the Bludgers.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      He showed Harry two identical balls, jet bl\\nack and slightly smaller than the red Quaffle. Harry \\nnoticed that they seemed to be straining to \\nescape the straps holdi\\nng them inside the box. \\n \\n      ﬁStand back,ﬂ Wood warned Harry. \\nHe bent down and freed one of the Bludgers.  \\n      At once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at Harry™s face. Harry swung \\nat it with the bat to stop it from breaking his \\nnose, and sent it zigzagging away into the air Š it \\nzoomed around their heads and then shot at W\\nood, who dived on top of it and managed to pin it \\nto the ground.  \\n      ﬁSee?ﬂ Wood panted, fo\\nrcing the struggling Bludger back into the crate and strapping it down safely. ﬁThe Bludgers rocket around, trying to knock players off their brooms. That™s why you \\nhave two Beaters on each team Š the Weasley twins are ours Š it™s their job to protect their \\n\\nside from the Bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team. So Š think you™ve got all \\n\\nthat?ﬂ  \\n      ﬁThree Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper guards the goal posts; the Beaters \\nkeep the Bludgers away from their team,ﬂ Harry reeled off. \\n \\n      ﬁVery good,ﬂ said Wood. \\n \\n      ﬁEr Š have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?ﬂ Harry asked, hoping he sounded offhand.  \\n      ﬁNever at Hogwarts. We™ve had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that. Now, the \\nlast member of the team is the Seeker. Th\\nat™s you. And you don™t have to worry about the Quaffle or the Bludgers Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁŠ unless they crack my head open.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁDon™t worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers Š I mean, they™re like a pair \\nof human Bludgers themselves.ﬂ \\n      Wood reached into the crate and took out the \\nfourth and last ball. Compared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers, it was tiny, about the size of a large walnut. It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings.        ﬁThis,ﬂ said Wood, ﬁis the Golden Snitch, and it™s the \\nmost important ball of \\nthe lot. It™s very hard to catch because it™s so fast and difficult to s\\nee. It™s the Seeker™s job \\nto catch it. You™ve got to weave in and out of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it before the other \\n\\nteam™s Seeker, because whichever Seeker catches \\nthe Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and \\nfifty points, so they nearly always win. That™s why Seekers get fouled so much. A game of \\nQuidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages Š I think the record is \\nthree months, they had to keep bringing on subs\\ntitutes so the players could get some sleep. \\n \\n      ﬁWell, that™s it any questions?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      Harry shook his head. He understood what he had to do all right, it was doing it that was going to be the problem. \\n \\n      ﬁWe won™t practice with the Snitch yet,ﬂ said\\n Wood, carefully shutting it \\nback inside the crate, ﬁit™s too dark, we might lose it. Le\\nt™s try you out with a few of these.ﬂ  \\n      He pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few mi\\nnutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing the golf balls as \\nhard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch.  \\n      Harry didn™t miss a single one, and Wood wa\\ns delighted. After half an hour, night had really fallen and they couldn™t carry on.  \\n      ﬁThat Quidditch Cup™ll have our name on it \\nthis year,ﬂ said Wood happily as they trudged back \\nup to the castle. ﬁI wouldn™t be surprised if you turn out better than Charlie Weasley, and he \\ncould have played for England if he hadn™t gone off chasing dragons.ﬂ  \\n    Perhaps it was because he was now so busy, wh\\nat with Quidditch practice three evenings a week \\non top of all his homework, but Harry could hardly be\\nlieve it when he realized that he™d already \\n\\nbeen at Hogwarts two months. The castle felt mo\\nre like home than Privet Drive ever had. His \\nlessons, too, were becoming more and more intere\\nsting now that they had mastered the basics. \\n \\n      On Halloween morning they woke to th\\ne delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the \\ncorridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick announced\\n in Charms that he thought they were ready \\nto start making objects fly, something they had all \\nbeen dying to try since they™d seen him make \\nNeville™s toad zoom around the classroom. Professor \\nFlitwick put the class into pairs to practice. \\nHarry™s partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because Neville had been trying to catch his eye). Ron, however, was to be working with Hermione Granger. It was hard to tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this. \\nShe hadn™t spoken to either of them since the \\n\\nday Harry™s broomstick had arrived. \\n \\n      ﬁNow, don™t forget that nice wrist movement we™ve been practicing!ﬂ squeaked Professor \\nFlitwick, perched on top of his pile of books as \\nusual. ﬁSwish and flick, remember, swish and \\nflick. And saying the magic words properly is \\nvery important, too Š never forget Wizard \\nBaruffio, who said ‚s™ instead of ‚f™ and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest.ﬂ \\n       It was very difficult. Harry and Seamus sw\\nished and flicked, but the feather they were supposed \\nto be sending skyward just lay on the desktop. Seamus got so impa\\ntient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it Š Harry had to put it out with his hat. \\n \\n      Ron, at the next table, wasn™t having much more luck. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁWingardium Leviosa!ﬂ he shouted, waving his long arms like a windmill. \\n \\n      ﬁYou™re saying it wrong,ﬂ Harry heard Hermione snap. ﬁIt™s Wing-\\ngar-dium Levi-\\no-sa, make the \\n‚gar™ nice and long.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁYou do it, then, if you™re so clever,ﬂ Ron snarled. \\n \\n      Hermione rolled up the sleeves\\n of her gown, flicked her wand, and said, ﬁWingardium Leviosa!ﬂ  \\n      Their feather rose off the desk an\\nd hovered about four feet above their heads.  \\n      ﬁOh, well done!ﬂ cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. ﬁEveryone see here, Miss Granger™s done it!ﬂ \\n \\n      Ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class. \\n\\n       ﬁIt™s no wonder no one can stand her,ﬂ he said to Harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor, ﬁshe™s a nightmare, honestly.ﬂ \\n       Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried\\n past him. It was Hermio\\nne. Harry caught a glimpse \\nof her face Š and was startled to see that she was in tears. \\n \\n      ﬁI think she heard you.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁSo?ﬂ said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfo\\nrtable. ﬁShe must™ve noticed she™s got no friends.ﬂ  \\n      Hermione didn™t turn up for the next class \\nand wasn™t seen all after\\nnoon. On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry a\\nnd Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend \\nLavender that Hermione was crying in the girls™ \\nbathroom and wanted to be left alone. Ron \\nlooked still more awkward at this, but a moment \\nlater they had entered the Great Hall, where the \\nHalloween decorations put He\\nrmione out of their minds. \\n \\n      A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over \\nthe tables in low black clouds, making the candles\\n in the pumpkins stutter. The feast appeared \\nsuddenly on the golden plates, as it had at the start-of-term banquet. \\n       Harry was just helping himself to a baked po\\ntato when Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the \\nhall, his turban askew and terror on his face.\\n Everyone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore™s chair, slumped against the table,\\n and gasped, ﬁTroll Š in the dungeons Š thought you ought to know.ﬂ        He then sank to the floor in a dead faint. \\n \\n      There was an uproar. It took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of Professor \\nDumbledore™s wand to bring silence. \\n \\n      ﬁPrefects,ﬂ he rumbled, ﬁlead your Houses back to the dormitories immediately!ﬂ  \\n      Percy was in his element. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁFollow me! Stick together, first years! No \\nneed to fear the troll if \\nyou follow my orders! Stay \\nclose behind me, now. Make way, first years \\ncoming through! Excuse me, I™m a prefect!ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁHow could a troll get in?ﬂ \\nHarry asked as they climbed the stairs. \\n \\n      ﬁDon™t ask me, they™re supposed to be rea\\nlly stupid,ﬂ said Ron. ﬁMaybe Peeves let it in for a Halloween joke.ﬂ  \\n      They passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions. As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs\\n, Harry suddenly grabbed Ron™s arm. \\n \\n      ﬁI™ve just thought Š Hermione.ﬂ \\n       ﬁWhat about her?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁShe doesn™t know about the troll.ﬂ \\n \\n      Ron bit his lip. \\n \\n      ﬁOh, all right,ﬂ he snapped. ﬁBut Percy™d better not see us.ﬂ  \\n      Ducking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way, slipped down a deserted side corridor, and hurried off toward th\\ne girls™ bathroom. They had just\\n turned the corner when they \\nheard quick footsteps behind them. \\n \\n      ﬁPercy!ﬂ hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin.  \\n      Peering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape. He crossed the corridor and disappeared from view. \\n \\n      ﬁWhat™s he doing?ﬂ Harry whispered. ﬁWhy is\\nn™t he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers?ﬂ \\n      ﬁSearch me.ﬂ \\n \\n      Quietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor after Snape™s fading footsteps. \\n \\n      ﬁHe™s heading for the third floor,ﬂ Harry said, but Ron held up his hand.  \\n      ﬁCan you smell something?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture of old \\nsocks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean. \\n \\n      And then they heard it Š a low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet. Ron pointed \\nŠ at the end of a passage to the left, something huge was moving toward them. They shrank into \\nthe shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight. \\n \\n      It was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, granite gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top lik\\ne a coconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat, horny feet. The smell coming \\nfrom it was incredible. It was holding a huge wooden club, which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long. \\n \\n      The troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside. It waggled its long ears, making up its \\ntiny mind, then slouched slowly into the room. \\n \\n      ﬁThe keys in the lock,ﬂ Harry muttered. ﬁWe could lock it in.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁGood idea,ﬂ said Ron nervously.        They edged toward the open door, mouths dry, \\npraying the troll wasn™t about to come out of it. \\nWith one great leap, Harry managed to grab the key, slam the door, and lock it. \\n \\n      ﬁYes!ﬂ  \\n      Flushed with their victory, they started to run back up the passage, but as they reached the corner \\nthey heard something that made their hearts\\n stop Š a high, petrified scream Š and it was \\ncoming from the chamber th\\ney™d just chained up.  \\n      ﬁOh, no,ﬂ said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron.  \\n      ﬁIt™s the girls™ bathroom!ﬂ Harry gasped. \\n \\n      ﬁHermione!ﬂ they said together.  \\n      It was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did they have? Wheeling around, they \\nsprinted back to the door and turned the key, fumbling in their panic. Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside.        Hermione Granger was shrinking against th\\ne wall opposite, looking as if she was about to faint. The troll was advancing on her, knocking the sinks off the walls as it went.        ﬁConfuse it!ﬂ Harry said desperately to R\\non, and, seizing a tap, he threw it as hard as he could against the wall. \\n \\n      The troll stopped a few feet from Hermi\\none. It lumbered around, blinking stupidly, to see what \\nhad made the noise. Its mean little eyes saw Harry. \\nIt hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting \\nits club as it went.  \\n      ﬁOy, pea-brain!ﬂ yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber, and he threw a metal pipe at it. \\nThe troll didn™t even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, turning its ugly snout toward Ron instead, giving Harry time to run around it. \\n \\n      ﬁCome on, run, \\nrun!ﬂ Harry yelled at Hermione, trying \\nto pull her toward \\nthe door, but she couldn™t move, she was still flat agains\\nt the wall, her mouth open with terror. \\n \\n      The shouting and the echoes seemed to be dr\\niving the troll berserk. It \\nroared again and started \\ntoward Ron, who was nearest and had no way to escape.  \\n      Harry then did something that was both ve\\nry brave and very stupid: He took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the tr\\noll™s neck from behind. \\nThe troll couldn™t feel Harry hanging there, but even a troll will notice \\nif you stick a long bit of wood up its nose, and \\nHarry™s wand had still been in his hand when he™d jumped Œ it had gone straight up one of the \\ntroll™s nostrils. \\n       Howling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its club, with Harry clinging on for dear life; any second, the troll was going to rip him off or catch him a terrible blow with the club. \\n       Hermione had sunk to the floor in fri\\nght; Ron pulled out his own wand Š not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head: ﬁ\\nWingardium \\nLeviosa!ﬂ  \\n      The club flew suddenly out of the troll™s hand, rose high, high up into the air, turned slowly over Š and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto its owner™s head. The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face, with a thud that made the whole room tremble. \\n \\n      Harry got to his feet. He was shaking and out of breath. Ron was standing there with his wand still raised, staring at\\n what he had done.  \\n      It was Hermione who spoke first. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁIs it Š dead?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁI don™t think so,ﬂ said Harry, ﬁI think it™s just been knocked out.ﬂ        He bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll™s nose. It was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue. \\n       ﬁUrgh Š troll boogers.ﬂ \\n \\n      He wiped it on the troll™s trousers. \\n\\n \\n      A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made \\nthe three of them look up. They hadn™t realized \\nwhat a racket they had been making, but of c\\nourse, someone downstairs must have heard the \\ncrashes and the troll™s roars. A moment later, \\nProfessor McGonagall had \\ncome bursting into the \\nroom, closely followed by Snape, with Quirrell \\nbringing up the rear. Quirrell took one look at the troll, let out a faint whimper, and sat qui\\nckly down on a toilet, clutching his heart. \\n \\n      Snape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron and Harry. Harry had never seen her look so angry. Her lips were white. Hopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry™s mind.  \\n      ﬁWhat on earth were you thinking of?ﬂ said \\nProfessor McGonagall, with cold fury in her voice. Harry looked at Ron, who was still standing with his wand in the air. ﬁYou™re lucky you weren™t killed. Why aren™t you in your dormitory?ﬂ \\n \\n      Snape gave Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry looked at the floor. He wished Ron would put his wand down.  \\n      Then a small voice came out of the shadows. \\n\\n       ﬁPlease, Professor McGonagall Š they were looking for me.ﬂ \\n       ﬁMiss Granger!ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      Hermione had managed to get to her feet at last. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁI went looking for the troll because I Š I thought I could deal with it on my own Š you know, \\nbecause I™ve read all about them.ﬂ \\n \\n      Ron dropped his wand. Hermione Gra\\nnger, telling a downright lie to a teacher? \\n \\n      ﬁIf they hadn™t found me, I™d be dead \\nnow. Harry stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club. They didn™t have time to co\\nme and fetch anyone. It was about to finish me \\noff when they arrived.ﬂ  \\n      Harry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasn™t new to them. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁWell Š in that case–ﬂ said Professor McG\\nonagall, staring at the three of them, ﬁMiss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own?ﬂ \\n       Hermione hung her head. Harry was speechless. Hermione was the last person to do anything \\nagainst the rules, and here she was, pretending she had, to get them out of trouble. It was as if \\nSnape had started handing out sweets.        ﬁMiss Granger, five point\\ns will be taken from Gryffindor for this,ﬂ said Professor McGonagall. ﬁI™m very disappointed in you. If you™re not hurt at\\n all, you™d better get off to Gryffindor tower. \\nStudents are finishing the feast in their houses.ﬂ  \\n      Hermione left. \\n\\n \\n      Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron.  \\n      ﬁWell, I still say you were lucky, but not\\n many first years could ha\\nve taken on a full-grown mountain troll. You each win Gryffindor five point\\ns. Professor Dumbledore will be informed of \\nthis. You may go.ﬂ  \\n      They hurried out of the chamber and didn™\\nt speak at all until they had climbed two floors up. It \\nwas a relief to be away from the smell of\\n the troll, quite apart from anything else. \\n \\n      ﬁWe should have gotten more than ten points,ﬂ Ron grumbled. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁFive, you mean, once she™s taken off Hermione™s.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁGood of her to get us out of trouble like that,ﬂ Ron admitted. ﬁMind you, we \\ndid save her.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁShe might not have needed saving if we \\nhadn™t locked the thing in \\nwith her,ﬂ Harry reminded \\nhim. \\n \\n      They had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁPig snout,ﬂ they said and entered. \\n \\n      The common room was packed and noisy. \\nEveryone was eating the food that had been sent up. Hermione, however, stood alone by the door, waiting for them. There was a very embarrassed \\n\\npause. Then, none of them looking at each other, \\nthey all said ﬁThanks,ﬂ and hurried off to get \\nplates.  \\n      But from that moment on, Hermione Gr\\nanger became their friend. There are some things you \\ncan™t share without ending up liking each other, a\\nnd knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is \\none of them. \\n \\n         CHAPTER ELEVEN \\n  Quidditch     As they entered November, the weather tu\\nrned very cold. The mountains around the school \\nbecame icy gray and the lake like chilled steel. Every morning the ground was covered in frost. \\n\\nHagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field, \\n\\nbundled up in a long moleskin overcoat, rabbit fu\\nr gloves, and enormous beaverskin boots. \\n \\n      The Quidditch season had begun. On Saturday, Harry would be playing in his first match after \\nweeks of training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin. If Gryffindor won, they would move up into \\nsecond place in the house championship. \\n \\n      Hardly anyone had seen Harry play becau\\nse Wood had decided that, as their secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret. But the news that he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry didn™t know which was wors\\ne Š people telling him he™d be brilliant or \\npeople telling him they™d be running \\naround underneath him holding a mattress. \\n \\n      It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermione as a friend. He didn™t know how he™d have \\ngotten through all his homework without her, wh\\nat with all the last-minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them do. She had also lent him \\nQuidditch Through the Ages, which turned out to be a very interesting read.  \\n      Harry learned that there were seven hundred \\nways of committing a Quidditc\\nh foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup match in \\n1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest \\nand fastest players, and that most serious Qui\\ndditch accidents seemed to happen to them; that \\nalthough people rarely died playing Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert.        Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry and Ron had saved \\nher from the mountain troll, and she was much\\n nicer for it. The day before Harry™s first Quidditch match the three of them were out in\\n the freezing courtyard during break, and she had \\nconjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar. They were standing \\nwith their backs to it, getting warm, when Snap\\ne crossed the yard. Harry noticed at once that \\nSnape was limping. Harry, Ron, and Hermione move\\nd closer together to block the fire from \\nview; they were sure it wouldn™t be allowed. Unfortunately, something about their guilty faces \\ncaught Snape™s eye. He limped over. He hadn™t seen\\n the fire, but he seemed to be looking for a \\nreason to tell them off anyway. \\n \\n      ﬁWhat™s that \\nyou™ve got there, Potter?ﬂ \\n \\n      It was Quidditch Through the Ages. Harry showed him. \\n \\n      ﬁLibrary books are not to be taken outside the school,ﬂ said Snape. ﬁGive it to me. Five points \\nfrom Gryffindor.ﬂ \\n      ﬁHe™s just made that rule up,ﬂ Harry mu\\nttered angrily as Snape limped away. ﬁWonder what™s \\nwrong with his leg?ﬂ        ﬁDunno, but I hope it™s really hurting him,ﬂ said Ron bitterly. \\n   The Gryffindor common room was very noisy that eveni\\nng. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat \\ntogether next to a window. Hermione was ch\\necking Harry and Ron™s Charms homework for \\nthem. She would never let them copy (ﬁHow w\\nill you learn?ﬂ), but by asking her to read it \\nthrough, they got the right answers anyway.  \\n      Harry felt restless. He wanted \\nQuidditch Through the Ages back, to take his mind off his nerves \\nabout tomorrow. Why should he be afraid of Sn\\nape? Getting up, he told Ron and Hermione he \\nwas going to ask Snape if he could have it.  \\n      ﬁBetter you than me,ﬂ they said together, \\nbut Harry had an idea that Snape wouldn™t refuse if \\nthere were other teachers listening. \\n \\n      He made his way down to the staffroo\\nm and knocked. There was no answer. He knocked again. \\nNothing.  \\n      Perhaps Snape had left the book in there? It was worth a try. He pushed the door ajar and peered \\ninside Œ and a horrible scene met his eyes. \\n \\n      Snape and Filch were inside, alone. Snape was holding his robes above his knees. One of his legs was bloody and mangled. Filch was handing Snape bandages. \\n       ﬁBlasted thing,ﬂ Snape was saying. ﬁHow are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once?ﬂ        Harry tried to shut the door quietly, but Š \\n \\n      ﬁPOTTER!ﬂ \\n \\n      Snape™s face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes quickly to\\n hide his leg. Harry gulped.  \\n      ﬁI just wondered if I could have my book back.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁGET OUT! OUT! ﬂ  \\n      Harry left, before Snape could take any mo\\nre points from Gryffindor. He sprinted back upstairs.  \\n      ﬁDid you get it?ﬂ Ron asked as Harry joined them. ﬁWhat™s the matter?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      In a low whisper, Harry told them what he™d seen. \\n \\n      ﬁYou know what this means?ﬂ he finished br\\neathlessly. ﬁHe tried to get past that three-headed dog at Halloween! That™s where he was going when we saw him Š he™s after whatever it™s \\nguarding! And I™d bet my broomstick \\nhe let that troll in, to make a diversion!ﬂ        Hermione™s eyes were wide. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁNo Š he wouldn™t,ﬂ she said. ﬁI know he™s not very nice, but he wouldn™t try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁHonestly, Hermione, you think all teachers \\nare saints or something,ﬂ snapped Ron. ﬁI™m with \\nHarry. I wouldn™t put anything past Snape. But what™s he after? What™s that dog guarding?ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry went to bed with his head buzzing \\nwith the same question. Neville was snoring loudly, but \\nHarry couldn™t sleep. He tried to empty his mind Š \\nhe needed to sleep, he had to, he had his first Quidditch match in a few hours Œ but the expres\\nsion on Snape™s face when Harry had seen his leg wasn™t easy to forget.  \\n  The next morning dawned very bright and cold. \\nThe Great Hall was full of the delicious smell of \\nfried sausages and the cheerful chatter of everyone looking forward to a good Quidditch match. \\n \\n      ﬁYou™ve got to eat some breakfast.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁI don™t want anything.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁJust a bit of toast,ﬂ wheedled Hermione. \\n \\n      ﬁI™m not hungry.ﬂ \\n       Harry felt terrible. In an hour™s time he™d be walking onto the field. \\n \\n      ﬁHarry, you need your strength,ﬂ said Seamus Finnigan. ﬁSeekers are \\nalways the ones who get clobbered by the other team.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁThanks, Seamus,ﬂ said Harry, watching Seamus pile ketchup on his sausages. \\n\\n \\n    By eleven o™clock the whol\\ne school seemed to be out in th\\ne stands around the Quidditch pitch. Many students had binoculars. The seats might be ra\\nised high in the air, but it was still difficult \\nto see what was going on sometimes. \\n \\n      Ron and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, \\nand Dean the West Ham fan up in the top row. As a \\nsurprise for Harry, they had painted a large banner on one of the sheets Scabbers had ruined. It \\nsaid Potter for President\\n, and Dean, who was good at drawing, had done a large Gryffindor lion underneath. Then Hermione had performed a tricky lit\\ntle charm so that the paint flashed different colors.  \\n      Meanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and th\\ne rest of the team were \\nchanging into their scarlet \\nQuidditch robes (Slytherin w\\nould be playing in green).       Wood cleared his throat for silence. \\n \\n      ﬁOkay, men,ﬂ he said. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁAnd women,ﬂ said Chaser Angelina Johnson. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁAnd women,ﬂ Wood agreed. ﬁThis is it.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁThe big one,ﬂ said Fred Weasley. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁThe one we™ve all been waiting for,ﬂ said George.  \\n      ﬁWe know Oliver™s speech by heart,ﬂ Fred told Harry, ﬁwe were on the team last year.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁShut up, you two,ﬂ said Wood. ﬁThis is the be\\nst team Gryffindor™s had in\\n years. We™re going to win. I know it.ﬂ  \\n      He glared at them all as if to say, ﬁOr else.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁRight. It™s time. Good luck, all of you.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      Harry followed Fred and George out of the locker room and, hoping his knees weren™t going to \\ngive way, walked onto the field to loud cheers.  \\n      Madam Hooch was refereeing. She stood in th\\ne middle of the field waiting for the two teams, her \\nbroom in her hand. \\n \\n      ﬁNow, I want a nice fair game, all of you,ﬂ\\n she said, once they were all gathered around her. Harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking part\\nicularly to the Slytheri\\nn Captain, Marcus Flint, a sixth year. Harry thought Flint looked as if he had some tro\\nll blood in him. Out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above, flashing Potter for President over the crowd. His heart skipped. He felt braver.  \\n      ﬁMount your brooms, please.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      Harry clambered onto his Nimbus Two Thousand. \\n\\n \\n      Madam Hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle. \\n\\n \\n      Fifteen brooms rose up, high, high into the air. They were off. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁAnd the Quaffle is taken immediately by \\nAngelina Johnson of Gryffindor Š what an excellent Chaser that girl is, and rather attractive, too Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁJORDAN!ﬂ \\n       ﬁSorry, Professor.ﬂ  \\n      The Weasley twins™ friend, Lee Jorda\\nn, was doing the commentary for the match, closely \\nwatched by Professor McGonagall.  \\n      ﬁAnd she™s really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood™s, last year only a reserve Š back to Johnson and Š no, the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain Marcus Flint gains the Quaffle and off he goes Š Flint flying like an eagle up there Š he™s going to scŠ no, stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper \\nWood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle Š that™s Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive around Flint, off up the field and Š OUCH Š that must have hurt, hit in the back of the \\nhead by a Bludger Š Quaffle taken by the Slytherins Š that™s Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but he™s blocked by a second Bludger Š sent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can™t tell which Š nice play by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Johnson back in possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead \\nand off she goes Š she™s really flying Š dodges a speeding Bludger Š the goal posts are ahead Š come on, now, Angelina Š Keeper Bletchley \\ndives Š misses Š GRYFFINDORS SCORE!ﬂ \\n \\n      Gryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from the Slytherins. \\n \\n      ﬁBudge up there, move along.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁHagrid!ﬂ \\n \\n      Ron and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid enough space to join them. \\n\\n       ﬁBin watchin™ from me hut,ﬂ said Hagrid, \\npatting a large pair of binoculars around his neck, ﬁBut it isn™t the same as bein™ in the cr\\nowd. No sign of the Snitch yet, eh?ﬂ \\n       ﬁNope,ﬂ said Ron. ﬁHarry hasn™t had much to do yet.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁKept outta trouble, though, that™s somethin\\n™,ﬂ said Hagrid, raising his binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was Harry. \\n \\n      Way up above them, Harry was gliding over\\n the game, squinting about for some sign of the \\nSnitch. This was part of his and Wood™s game plan. \\n \\n      ﬁKeep out of the way until you catch sight \\nof the Snitch,ﬂ Wood had said. ﬁWe don™t want you \\nattacked before you have to be.ﬂ  \\n      When Angelina had scored, Harry had done \\na couple of loop-the-loops to let off his feelings. Now he was back to staring around for the Snitch. \\nOnce he caught sight of a flash of gold, but it was just a reflection from one of the Weasle\\nys™ wristwatches, and once a Bludger decided to come pelting his way, more like a cannonball th\\nan anything, but Harry dodged it and Fred Weasley came chasing after it. \\n       ﬁAll right there, Harry?ﬂ he had time to ye\\nll, as he beat the Bludger furiously toward Marcus Flint.        ﬁSlytherin in possession,ﬂ Lee Jordan was saying, ﬁChaser Pucey ducks two Bludgers, two Weasleys, and Chaser Bell, and speeds toward the Š wait a moment Š was that the Snitch?ﬂ \\n \\n      A murmur ran through the crowd as Adri\\nan Pucey dropped the Quaffle, too busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his left ear.  \\n      Harry saw it. In a great rush of excitement\\n he dived downward after the streak of gold. Slytherin Seeker Terence Higgs had seen it, too. Neck and neck they hurtled toward the Snitch Š all the \\nChasers seemed to have forgotten what they were\\n supposed to be doing as they hung in midair to \\nwatch.  \\n      Harry was faster than Higgs Š he could see the little round ball, wings fluttering, darting up ahead Š he put on an extra spurt of speed Š  \\n      WHAM! A roar of rage echoed from the \\nGryffindors below Š Marcus Flint had blocked Harry on purpose, and Harry™s broom spun off c\\nourse, Harry holding on for dear life.  \\n      ﬁFoul!ﬂ screamed the Gryffindors. \\n\\n \\n      Madam Hooch spoke angrily to Flint a\\nnd then ordered a free shot at the goal posts for Gryffindor. But in all the confusion, of course, the Golden Snitch had disappeared from sight again.        Down in the stands, Dean Thomas was yelling, ﬁSend him off, ref! Red card!ﬂ        ﬁWhat are you talking about, Dean?ﬂ said Ron. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁRed card!ﬂ said Dean furiously. ﬁIn soccer you get shown the red card and you™re out of the game!ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁBut this isn™t soccer, Dean,ﬂ Ron reminded him. \\n \\n      Hagrid, however, was on Dean™s side. \\n \\n      ﬁThey oughta change the rules. Flint coulda knocked Harry outta the air.ﬂ  \\n      Lee Jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides.  \\n      ﬁSo Š after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁJordan!ﬂ growled Professor McGonagall. \\n \\n      ﬁI mean, after that\\n open and revolting foul–ﬂ       ﬁJordan, I™m warning youŠﬂ        ﬁAll right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which could happen to anyone, I™m \\nsure, so a penalty to Gryffindor, taken by Spinner, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor still in possession.ﬂ  \\n      It was as Harry dodged another Bludger, which went spinning dangerously past his head, that it happened. His broom gave a sudden, frighteni\\nng lurch. For a split second, he thought he was \\ngoing to fall. He gripped the broom tightly wi\\nth both his hands and knees. He™d never felt \\nanything like that.  \\n      It happened again. It was as though the broom was trying to buck him off. But Nimbus Two \\nThousands did not suddenly decide to buck their riders off. Harry tried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goal-posts Š he had half a mind to as\\nk Wood to call time-out Š and then he realized \\n\\nthat his broom was completely out of\\n his control. He couldn™t turn it. He couldn™t direct it at all. It was zigzagging through the air, and every now and then making violent swishing movements \\nthat almost unseated him. \\n \\n      Lee was still commentating. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁSlytherin in possession Š Flint with the Quaffle Š passes Spinnet Š passes Bell Š hit hard in \\nthe face by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose Š on\\nly joking, Professor Š \\nSlytherins score Š A no–ﬂ  \\n      The Slytherins were cheering. No one seemed\\n to have noticed that Harry™s broom was behaving \\nstrangely. It was carrying him sl\\nowly higher, away from the game, jerking and twitching as it \\nwent.  \\n      ﬁDunno what Harry thinks he™s doing,ﬂ Hagrid mumbled. He stared th\\nrough his binoculars. ﬁIf I \\ndidn™ know better, I™d say he™d lost control of his broom– but he can™t have–ﬂ \\n \\n      Suddenly, people were pointing up at Harry all over the stands. His broom had started to roll \\nover and over, with him only just managing to \\nhold on. Then the whole crowd gasped. Harry™s broom had given a wild jerk and Harry swung o\\nff it. He was now dangling from it, holding on \\nwith only one hand.  \\n      ﬁDid something happen to it when Flint blocked him?ﬂ Seamus whispered. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁCan™t have,ﬂ Hagrid said, his voice shaking. ﬁCan™t nothing interfere with a broomstick except \\npowerful Dark magic Š no kid could do \\nthat to a Nimbus Two Thousand.ﬂ \\n \\n      At these words, Hermione seized Hagrid\\n™s binoculars, but instead of looking up at Harry, she started looking frantically at the crowd.  \\n      ﬁWhat are you doing?ﬂ moaned Ron, gray-faced. \\n\\n       ﬁI knew it,ﬂ Hermione gasped, ﬁSnape Š look.ﬂ \\n \\n      Ron grabbed the binoculars. Snape was in the middle of the stands opposite them. He had his \\neyes fixed on Harry and was muttering nonstop under his breath. \\n \\n      ﬁHe™s doing something Š jinxing the broom,ﬂ said Hermione. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁWhat should we do?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁLeave it to me.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      Before Ron could say another word, Hermi\\none had disappeared. Ron turned the binoculars back on Harry. His broom was vibrating so hard, it \\nwas almost impossible for him to hang on much \\nlonger. The whole crowd was on its feet, watching, terrified, as the Weasleys flew up to try and \\npull Harry safely onto one of their brooms, but\\n it was no good Œ every time they got near him, \\nthe broom would jump higher still. They dr\\nopped lower and circled beneath him, obviously \\nhoping to catch him if he fell. Marcus Flint sei\\nzed the Quaffle and scored five times without \\nanyone noticing.  \\n      ﬁCome on, Hermione,ﬂ Ron muttered desperately. \\n\\n \\n      Hermione had fought her way across to \\nthe stand where Snape stood, and was now racing along the row behind him; she didn™t even\\n stop to say sorry as she knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in front. Reaching Snape, she crouched down, pulled out her wand, and whispered a \\nfew, well-chosen words. Bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the hem of Snape™s robes. \\n       It took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize that he was on fire. A sudden yelp told her she had done her job. Scooping the fire off him into \\na little jar in her pocket, she scrambled back \\nalong the row Š Snape would never know what had happened.        It was enough. Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able to clamber back on to his broom. \\n \\n      ﬁNeville, you can look!ﬂ Ron said. Neville had b\\neen sobbing into Hagrid™s jacket for the last five \\nminutes. \\n \\n      Harry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as \\nthough he was about to be sick Š he hit the field on all fours Š coughed Š and something gold \\nfell into his hand.  \\n      ﬁI™ve got the Snitch!ﬂ he shouted, waving it above his head, and the game ended in complete \\nconfusion.  \\n      ﬁHe didn™t catch\\n it, he nearly swallowed it,ﬂ Flint was still howling \\ntwenty minutes later, but it \\nmade no difference Š Harry hadn™t broken any ru\\nles and Lee Jordan was still happily shouting the results Š Gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty. Harry heard none of this, though. He was being made a cup of st\\nrong tea back in Hagrid™s hut, with Ron and Hermione. \\n       ﬁIt was Snape,ﬂ Ron was explaining, ﬁHermione and I saw him. He was cursing your \\nbroomstick, muttering, he wouldn™\\nt take his eyes off you.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁRubbish,ﬂ said Hagrid, who hadn™t heard a word of what had \\ngone on next to him in the stands. ﬁWhy would Snape do somethin™ like that?ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one anot\\nher, wondering what to tell him. Harry decided on \\nthe truth.  \\n      ﬁI found out something about him,ﬂ he told \\nHagrid. ﬁHe tried to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween. It bit him. We think he was \\ntrying to steal whatever it™s guarding.ﬂ  \\n      Hagrid dropped the teapot. \\n \\n      ﬁHow do you know about Fluffy?ﬂ he said. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁFluffy?ﬂ  \\n      ﬁYeah Š he™s mine Š bought him off a Greek \\nchappie I met in the pub las™ year Š I lent him to \\nDumbledore to guard the Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁYes?ﬂ said Harry eagerly. \\n \\n      ﬁNow, don™t ask me anymore,ﬂ said \\nHagrid gruffly. ﬁThat™s top secret, that is.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁBut Snape™s trying to steal\\n it.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁRubbish,ﬂ said Hagrid again. ﬁSnape™s \\na Hogwarts teacher, he™d do nothin™ of the sort.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁSo why did he just try and kill Harry?ﬂ cried Hermione. \\n \\n      The afternoon™s events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about Snape. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁI know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I™ve read all about them\\n! You™ve got to keep eye contact, \\nand Snape wasn™t blinking at all, I saw him!ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁI™m tellin™ yeh, yer wrong!ﬂ said Hagrid \\nhotly. ﬁI don™ know why Harry\\n™s broom acted like that, \\nbut Snape wouldn™ try an™ kill a student! Now, listen to me, all three of\\n yeh Š yer meddlin™ in \\nthings that don™ concern yeh. It™s dangerous. You forget that dog, an™ you forget what it™s guardin™, that™s between Professor Dumbledore an™ Nicolas Flamel Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁAha!ﬂ said Harry, ﬁso there™s some\\none called Nicolas Flamel involved, is there?ﬂ \\n \\n      Hagrid looked furious with himself. \\nCHAPTER TWELVE   The Mirror of Erised  \\n     Christmas was coming. One morning in mid-D\\necember, Hogwarts woke to find itself covered in \\nseveral feet of snow. The lake froze solid and the Weasley tw\\nins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed Quirrell around, bouncing off the back of his turban. The few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be \\n\\nnursed back to health by Hagrid before they could fly off again. \\n \\n      No one could wait for the holidays to start. While the Gryffindor common room and the Great \\nHall had roaring fires, the drafty corridors had become icy and \\na bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms. Worst of all were Professo\\nr Snape™s classes down in the dungeons, where their breath rose in a mist before them and they ke\\npt as close as possible \\nto their hot cauldrons.  \\n      ﬁI do feel so sorry,ﬂ said Draco Malfoy, one Potions class, ﬁfor all those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they™re not wanted at home.ﬂ \\n \\n      He was looking over at Harry as he spoke. Crabbe and Goyle chuckled. Harry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lionfish, ignored\\n them. Malfoy had been even more unpleasant \\nthan usual since the Quidditch match. Disgusted that\\n the Slytherins had lost, he had tried to get \\neveryone laughing at how a wide-mouthed tree frog would be replacing Harry as Seeker next. Then he™d realized that nobody found this funny, b\\necause they were all so impressed at the way \\nHarry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick. So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone \\nback to taunting Harry about having no proper family. \\n \\n      It was true that Harry wasn™t going back to Privet Drive for Christmas. Professor McGonagall \\nhad come around the week before, making a list\\n of students who would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had signed up at once. He didn™t feel sorry for himself at all; this would \\nprobably be the best Christmas he™d ever had. R\\non and his brothers were staying, too, because \\nMr. and Mrs. Weasley were going \\nto Romania to visit Charlie. \\n \\n      When they left the dungeons at the end \\nof Potions, they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead. Two enormous feet sticking out at\\n the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them \\nthat Hagrid was behind it.  \\n      ﬁHi, Hagrid, want any help?ﬂ Ro\\nn asked, sticking his head through the branches.  \\n      ﬁNah, I™m all right, thanks, Ron.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWould you mind moving out of the way?ﬂ came\\n Malfoy™s cold drawl from behind them. ﬁAre \\nyou trying to earn some extra money, Weasley? Hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you \\n\\nleave Hogwarts, I suppose Š that hut of Hagrid\\n™s must seem like a palace compared to what \\nyour family™s used to.ﬂ \\n       Ron dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs. \\n \\n      ﬁWEASLEY!ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      Ron let go of the front of Malfoy™s robes. \\n \\n      ﬁHe was provoked, Professor Snape,ﬂ said Hagrid, sticking his huge hairy face out from behind \\nthe tree. ﬁMalfoy was insultin™ his family.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁBe that as it may, fighting is against Hogw\\narts rules, Hagrid,ﬂ said Snape silkily. ﬁFive points from Gryffindor, Weasley, and be grateful\\n it isn™t more. Move along, all of you.ﬂ \\n \\n      Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past the tree, scattering needles everywhere and smirking. \\n \\n      ﬁI™ll get him,ﬂ said Ron, \\ngrinding his teeth at Malfoy™s back, ﬁone of these days, I™ll get him Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁI hate them both,ﬂ said Harry, ﬁMalfoy and Snape.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁCome on, cheer up, it™s nearly Christmas,ﬂ sa\\nid Hagrid. ﬁTell yeh what, come with me an™ see \\nthe Great Hall, looks a treat.ﬂ  \\n      So the three of them followed Hagrid \\nand his tree off to the Great Hall, where Professor \\nMcGonagall and Professor Flitwick were\\n busy with the Christmas decorations. \\n \\n      ﬁAh, Hagrid, the last tree Š put it in the far corner, would you?ﬂ \\n \\n      The hall looked spectacular. Festoons of holly and mis\\ntletoe hung all around the walls, and no less than twelve towering Christmas trees \\nstood around the room, some\\n sparkling with tiny icicles, some glittering \\nwith hundreds of candles.  \\n      ﬁHow many days you got left until yer holidays?ﬂ Hagrid asked. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁJust one,ﬂ said Hermione. ﬁAnd that re\\nminds me Š Harry, Ron, we™ve got half an hour before \\nlunch, we should be in the library.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁOh yeah, you™re right,ﬂ said Ron, tearing his eyes away from Professor Flitwick, who had \\ngolden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was \\ntrailing them over the branches of the new \\ntree.  \\n      ﬁThe library?ﬂ said Hagrid, following them out of the hall. ﬁJ\\nust before the holidays? Bit keen, \\naren™t yeh?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁOh, we™re not working,ﬂ Harry told him \\nbrightly. ﬁEver since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel \\nwe™ve been trying to find out who he is.ﬂ        ﬁYou what\\n?ﬂ Hagrid looked shocked. ﬁListen here Š I™ve\\n told yeh Š drop it. It™s nothin™ to you what that dog™s guardin™.ﬂ        ﬁWe just want to know who Nicola\\ns Flamel is, that™s all,ﬂ said Hermione. \\n \\n      ﬁUnless you™d like to tell us and save us the trouble?ﬂ Harry added. ﬁWe must™ve been through \\nhundreds of books already and we can™t find him a\\nnywhere Š just give us a hint Š I know I™ve read his name somewhere.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁI™m sayin™ not\\nhin™, said Hagrid flatly.   \\n      ﬁJust have to find out for ourselves, then,ﬂ said Ron, and they left Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library.  \\n      They had indeed been searching books for Flamel™s name ever since Hagrid had let it slip, \\nbecause how else were they going to find out what\\n Snape was trying to steal? The trouble was, it \\nwas very hard to know where to begin, not knowing what Flamel might have done to get himself \\ninto a book. He wasn™t in Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century\\n, or Notable Magical Names of Our Time; he was missing, too, from\\n Important Modern Magical Discoveries, and A Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry\\n. And then, of course, there was the sheer size of the library; \\ntens of thousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds of narrow rows. \\n \\n      Hermione took out a list of subjects and ti\\ntles she had decided to search while Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off \\nthe shelves at random. Harry wandered over to \\nthe Restricted Section. He had been wondering for \\na while if Flamel wasn™t somewhere in there. \\nUnfortunately, you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers \\nto look in any of the restricted books, and he knew he™d never get one. These were the books containing powerful Dark Magic never taught at Hogwarts, and only read by older students studying advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts. \\n \\n      ﬁWhat are you looking for, boy?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁNothing,ﬂ said Harry. \\n \\n      Madam Pince the librarian \\nbrandished a feather duster at him. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁYou™d better get out, then. Go on Š out!ﬂ \\n \\n      Wishing he™d been a bit quicker at thinki\\nng up some story, Harry left\\n the library. He, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed they™d better not \\nask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel. \\nThey were sure she™d be able to tell them, but \\nthey couldn™t risk Snape hearing what they were \\nup to.  \\n      Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything, but he wasn™t \\nvery hopeful. They had been looking for two weeks, after A, but as they only had odd moments \\nbetween lessons it wasn™t surprising they™d found nothing. What they really needed was a nice \\nlong search without Madam Pince breathing down their necks. \\n       Five minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, shaking their heads. They went off to lunch. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁYou will keep looking while I™m away, won™t you?ﬂ said Hermione. ﬁAnd send me an owl if \\nyou find anything.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁAnd you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is,ﬂ said Ron. ﬁIt™d be safe to ask \\nthem.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁVery safe, as they™re both dentists,ﬂ said Hermione. \\n\\n \\n    Once the holidays had started, Ron and Harry\\n were having too good a time to think much about \\nFlamel. They had the dormitory to themselves a\\nnd the common room was far emptier than usual, \\nso they were able to get the good armchairs by the fire. They sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a toasting fork Š bread, English muffins, marshmallows Š and plotting ways of \\ngetting Malfoy expelled, which were fun to \\ntalk about even if they wouldn™t work.  \\n      Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This was exactly like Muggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made \\nit a lot like directing troops in battle. Ron™s set was very old and battered. Like everything else he owned, it had once belonged to someone else in his family Š \\nin this case, his grandfather. However, old chessmen weren™t a drawback at all. Ron knew them \\nso well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wanted. \\n \\n      Harry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan \\nhad lent him, and they didn™t trust him at all. He \\nwasn™t a very good player yet and they kept shouting different bits of advice at him, which was \\nconfusing. ﬁDon™t send me there,\\n can™t you see his knight? Send him, we can afford to lose him\\n.ﬂ  \\n      On Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for the food and the fun, \\nbut not expecting any presents at all. When he woke early in\\n the morning, however, the first \\nthing he saw was a small pile of \\npackages at the foot of his bed.  \\n      ﬁMerry Christmas,ﬂ said Ron sleepily as \\nHarry scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe. \\n \\n      ﬁYou, too,ﬂ said Harry. ﬁWill you look at this? I™ve got some presents!ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁWhat did you expect, turnips?ﬂ said Ron, tu\\nrning to his own pile, which was a lot bigger than Harry™s.  \\n      Harry picked up the top parcel. It was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across it was To Harry, from Hagrid. Inside was a roughly cut wooden flut\\ne. Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself. Harry blew it Š it \\nsounded a bit like an owl.  \\n      A second, very small parcel contained a note. \\n\\n \\n      We received your message and enclose your Christmas present. From Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia. Taped to the note was a fifty-pence piece.        ﬁThat™s friendly,ﬂ said Harry. \\n\\n \\n      Ron was fascinated by the fifty pence. \\n \\n      ﬁWeird!\\nﬂ he said, ‚What a shape! This is money?ﬂ  \\n      ﬁYou can keep it,ﬂ said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was. ﬁHagrid and my aunt and uncle \\nŠ so who sent these?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁI think I know who that one™s from,ﬂ said\\n Ron, turning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy \\nparcel. ﬁMy mom. I told her you didn™t expect \\nany presents and Š oh, no,ﬂ he groaned, ﬁshe™s made you a Weasley sweater.ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand-knitted sweater in emerald green and a large \\nbox of homemade fudge. \\n \\n      ﬁEvery year she makes us a swea\\nter,ﬂ said Ron, unwrapping his own, ﬁand mine™s \\nalways maroon.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁThat™s really nice of her,ﬂ said\\n Harry, trying the fudge, which was very tasty.  \\n      His next present also contained candy Š a large box of Chocolate Frogs from Hermione. \\n \\n      This only left one parcel. Harry picked it up and felt it. It was very light. He unwrapped it.  \\n      Something fluid and silver\\ny gray went slithering to the floor where it lay in gleaming folds. Ron \\ngasped.  \\n      ﬁI™ve heard of those,ﬂ he said in a hushed voice, dropping the box of Every Flavor Beans he™d gotten from Hermione. ﬁIf that™s what I \\nthink it is Š they™re really rare, and really valuable.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁWhat is it?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      Harry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor. It was strange to \\nthe touch, like water woven into material. \\n \\n      ﬁIt™s an invisibility cloak,ﬂ said Ron, a \\nlook of awe on his face. ﬁI™m sure it is Š try it on.ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave a yell.  \\n      ﬁIt is! Look down!ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry looked down at his feet, but they were gone. He dashed to the mirror. Sure enough, his \\nreflection looked back at him, just his head suspended in midair, his body completely invisible. \\nHe pulled the cloak over his head and his reflection vanished completely. \\n       ﬁThere™s a note!ﬂ said Ron suddenly. ﬁA note fell out of it!ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter. Written in narrow, loopy writing he had never \\nseen before were the following words:    Your father left this in my possession before he died. \\n   It is time it was returned to you. \\n\\n \\n  Use it well. \\n\\n \\n  A Very Merry Christmas to you. \\n     There was no signature. Harry stared\\n at the note. Ron was admiring the cloak. \\n \\n      ﬁI™d give anything for one of these,ﬂ he said. ﬁAnything. What™s the matter?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁNothing,ﬂ said Harry. He felt very strange. Who had sent the cloak? Had it really once belonged to his father? \\n \\n      Before he could say or think anything else, the dormito\\nry door was flung open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in. Harry stuffed the cloa\\nk quickly out of sight. He didn™t feel like sharing it with anyone else yet.        ﬁMerry Christmas!ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁHey, look Š Harry™s got a Weasley sweater, too!ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large yellow F on it, the other a G.  \\n      ﬁHarry™s is better than ours, though,ﬂ said Fred, holding up Harry™s sweater. ﬁShe obviously makes more of an effort if you™re not family.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWhy aren™t you wearing yours, Ron?ﬂ Ge\\norge demanded. ﬁCome on, get it on, they™re lovely \\nand warm.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁI hate maroon,ﬂ Ron moaned ha\\nlfheartedly as he pulled it over his head.  \\n      ﬁYou haven™t got a letter on yours,ﬂ George observed. ﬁI suppose she thinks you don™t forget your name. But we™re not stupid Š we \\nknow we™re called Gred and Forge.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWhat™s all this noise?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      Percy Weasley stuck his head through the door, looking disapproving. He had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he, too, carried a lumpy sweater over his arm, which \\nFred seized. \\n       ﬁP for prefect! Get it on, Percy, come \\non, we™re all wearing ours, even Harry got one.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁI Š don™t Š want Šﬂ said Percy thickly, as the twins forced the sweater over his head, \\nknocking his glasses askew.  \\n      ﬁAnd you™re not sitting with the prefects today, either,ﬂ said \\nGeorge. ﬁChristmas is a time for \\nfamily.ﬂ \\n \\n      They frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms pinned to his side by his sweater. \\n\\n \\n    Harry had never in all his life had such \\na Christmas dinner. A hundred fat, roast turkeys; mountains of roast and boiled potatoes; platters of chipolatas; tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich gravy and cranberry sauce Œ and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table. These fantastic\\n party favors were nothing like the feeble Muggle ones the \\nDursleys usually bought, with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside. Harry \\npulled a wizard cracker with Fred and it didn™t just bang, it went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, wh\\nile from the inside exploded a rear admiral™s \\nhat and several live, white mice. Up at the \\nHigh Table, Dumbledore had swapped his pointed \\nwizard™s hat for a flowered bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick had \\njust read him.  \\n      Flaming Christmas puddings followed the turk\\ney. Percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice. Harry watched Hagrid ge\\ntting redder and redder in the face as he called \\nfor more wine, finally kissing Professor McG\\nonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry™s amazement, \\ngiggled and blushed, her top hat lopsided.  \\n      When Harry finally left the table, he was \\nladen down with a stack of things out of the crackers, \\nincluding a pack of nonexplodable, luminous ba\\nlloons, a Grow-Your-Own-Warts kit, and his \\nown new wizard chess set. The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling they \\n\\nwere going to end up as Mrs. Norris™s Christmas dinner. \\n \\n      Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy af\\nternoon having a furious snowball fight on the grounds. Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke in his new chess set by \\nlosing spectacularly to Ron. He suspected he \\nwouldn™t have lost so badly if Percy hadn™t tried to help him so much. \\n \\n      After a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpe\\nts, trifle, and Christmas cake, everyone felt too full \\nand sleepy to do much before bed except sit a\\nnd watch Percy chase Fred\\n and George all over Gryffindor tower because they™d stolen his prefect badge.  \\n      It had been Harry™s best Christmas day ev\\ner. Yet something had been \\nnagging at the back of his mind all day. Not until he climbed into bed was he free to think about it: the invisibility cloak \\n\\nand whoever had sent it.       Ron, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him, fell asleep almost as \\nsoon as he™d drawn the curtains of his four-poster. Harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it.        His father™s– this had been his father™s. He let the material flow over his hands, smoother than \\nsilk, light as air. Use it well, the note had said.  \\n      He had to try it, now. He slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak around himself. Looking \\ndown at his legs, he saw only moonlight a\\nnd shadows. It was a very funny feeling.  \\n      Use it well. \\n \\n      Suddenly, Harry felt wide-awake. The whole of Hogwarts was open to him in this cloak. \\nExcitement flooded through him as he stood there in\\n the dark and silence. He could go anywhere in this, anywhere, and Filch would never know.  \\n      Ron grunted in his sleep. Should Harry wake him? Something held him back Š his father™s \\ncloak Š he felt that this time Š the fi\\nrst time Š he wanted to use it alone. \\n \\n      He crept out of the dormitory, down th\\ne stairs, across the common room, and climbed through the portrait hole. \\n \\n      ﬁWho™s there?ﬂ squawked the Fat Lady. Harry said nothing. He walked quickly down the \\ncorridor. \\n \\n      Where should he go? He stopped, his hear\\nt racing, and thought. And then it came to him. The \\nRestricted Section in the library. He™d be able to\\n read as long as he liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel was. He set off, drawing \\nthe invisibility cloak tight around him as he \\nwalked.  \\n      The library was pitch-black and very eerie. Harry lit a lamp to see his way along the rows of books. The lamp looked as if it was floating along \\nin midair, and even though Harry could feel \\nhis arm supporting it, the si\\nght gave him the creeps. \\n \\n      The Restricted Section was right at the back\\n of the library. Stepping carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the librar\\ny, he held up his lamp to read the titles. \\n \\n      They didn™t tell him much. Their peeling, \\nfaded gold letters spelled words in languages Harry \\ncouldn™t understand. Some had no title at all. One book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly \\n\\nlike blood. The hairs on the back of Harry™s neck prickled. Maybe he was imagining it, maybe \\nnot, but he thought a faint whispering was coming\\n from the books, as though they knew someone \\nwas there who shouldn™t be. \\n \\n      He had to start somewhere. Setting the lamp down carefully on the \\nfloor, he looked along the bottom shelf for an interesting looking book. A larg\\ne black and silver volume caught his eye. He \\npulled it out with difficulty, because it was very heavy, and, balancing it on his knee, let it fall \\nopen.        A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence Š the book was screaming! Harry snapped it \\nshut, but the shriek went on and on, one high, unbroken, earsplitting note. He stumbled backward \\nand knocked over his lamp, which went out at once. Panicking, he heard footsteps coming down \\nthe corridor outside Š stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf, he ran for it. He passed Filch in the doorway; Filch™s pale, wild eyes \\nlooked straight through him, and Harry slipped \\nunder Filch™s outstretched arm and streaked off up \\nthe corridor, the book™s shrieks still ringing in his ears.  \\n      He came to a sudden halt in front of a tall su\\nit of armor. He had been so busy getting away from \\nthe library, he hadn™t paid attention to where he was going. Perhaps because it was dark, he didn™t recognize where he was at all. There was \\na suit of armor near the \\nkitchens, he knew, but he must be five floors above there. \\n \\n      ﬁYou asked me to come directly to you, Prof\\nessor, if anyone was wandering around at night, and somebody™s been in the library Restricted Section.ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry felt the blood drain out of his face. Wh\\nerever he was, Filch must know a shortcut, because \\nhis soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and to\\n his horror, it was Snape who replied, ﬁThe Restricted Section? Well, they can\\n™t be far, we™ll catch them.ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corn\\ner ahead. They couldn™t see him, of course, but it was a \\nnarrow corridor and if they came \\nmuch nearer they™d knock right into him Š the cloak didn™t stop him from being solid. \\n       He backed away as quietly as he could. A door stood ajar to his left. It was his only hope. He squeezed through it, holding his breath, trying not to \\nmove it, and to his relief he managed to get \\ninside the room without their \\nnoticing anything. They walked st\\nraight past, and Harry leaned against the wall, breathing deeply, listening to their footsteps dying away. That had been close, very close. It was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in. \\n       It looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper ba\\nsket Œ but propped against the wall facing him \\n\\nwas something that didn™t look as if it belonged th\\nere, something that looked as if someone had \\njust put it there to k\\neep it out of the way.  \\n      It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the \\nceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two \\nclawed feet. There was an inscription carved around the top: \\nErised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. His panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry moved nearer \\nto the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see \\nno reflection again. He stepped in front of it.  \\n      He had to clap his hands to his mouth \\nto stop himself from screaming. He whirled around. His \\nheart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed Š for he had seen not \\n\\nonly himself in the mirror, but a whole cr\\nowd of people standing right behind him. \\n       But the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to the mirror. \\n \\n      There he was, reflected in it, white and scared-looking, and there, reflected behind him, were at \\nleast ten others. Harry looked over his shoulder Š but still, no one was there. Or were they all invisible, too? Was he in fact in\\n a room full of invisible people \\nand this mirror™s trick was that it \\nreflected them, invisible or not? \\n \\n      He looked in the mirror again. A woman \\nstanding right behind his reflection was smiling at him \\nand waving. He reached out a hand and felt the air behind him. If she was really there, he™d touch \\nher, their reflections were so close together, but he felt only air Œ she and the others existed only in the mirror. \\n \\n      She was a very pretty woman. \\nShe had dark red hair and her eyes Šher eyes are just like mine\\n, Harry thought, edging a little closer to the glass. Bright green Š exactly the same shape, but then \\nhe noticed that she was crying; smiling, but crying \\nat the same time. The tall, thin, black-haired \\nman standing next to her put his \\narm around her. He wore glasses,\\n and his hair was very untidy. It stuck up at the back, just as Harry™s did.  \\n      Harry was so close to the mirror now that \\nhis nose was nearly touching that of his reflection.  \\n      ﬁMom?ﬂ he whispered. ﬁDad?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      They just looked at him, smiling. And slowl\\ny, Harry looked into the faces of the other people in \\nthe mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like \\nhis, other noses like his, even a little old man \\nwho looked as though he had Harry™s knobbly knees Š Harry was looking at his family, for the \\n\\nfirst time in his life. \\n \\n      The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and \\nhe stared hungrily back at them, his hands pressed \\nflat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them. He had a \\npowerful kind of ache inside him, ha\\nlf joy, half terrible sadness.  \\n      How long he stood there, he didn™t know. The reflections did not fade and he looked and looked \\nuntil a distant noise brought him back to his senses\\n. He couldn™t stay here, he had to find his way back to bed. He tore his eyes away from his mother™s face, whispered, ﬁI™ll come back,ﬂ and \\nhurried from the room. \\n \\n  ﬁYou could have woken me up,ﬂ said Ron, crossly. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁYou can come tonight, I™m going back, I want to show you the mirror.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁI™d like to see your mom and dad,ﬂ Ron said eagerly. \\n \\n      ﬁAnd I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, you™ll be able to show me your other \\nbrothers and everyone.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁYou can see them any old time,ﬂ said R\\non. ﬁJust come round my house this summer. Anyway, \\nmaybe it only shows dead people. Shame about \\nnot finding Flamel, though. Have some bacon or \\nsomething, why aren™t \\nyou eating anything?ﬂ \\n       Harry couldn™t eat. He had seen his pare\\nnts and would be seeing them again tonight. He had \\nalmost forgotten about Flamel. It didn™t seem ve\\nry important anymore. Wh\\no cared what the three \\nheaded dog was guarding? What did it \\nmatter if Snape stole it, really? \\n \\n      ﬁAre you all right?ﬂ said Ron. ﬁYou look odd.ﬂ \\n \\n  What Harry feared most was th\\nat he might not be able to fi\\nnd the mirror room again. With Ron \\ncovered in the cloak, too, they had to walk much \\nmore slowly the next night. They tried retracing \\nHarry™s route from the library, wandering around\\n the dark passageways for nearly an hour.  \\n      ﬁI™m freezing,ﬂ said R\\non. ﬁLet™s forget it and go back.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁNo!ﬂ Harry hissed. ﬁI know it™s here somewhere.ﬂ \\n \\n      They passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction, but saw no one else. just as Ron started moaning that his feet were dead\\n with cold, Harry spotted the suit of armor. \\n \\n      ﬁIt™s here Š just here Š yes!ﬂ \\n \\n      They pushed the door open. Harry dropped the cloak from around his shoulders and ran to the mirror. \\n \\n      There they were. His mother a\\nnd father beamed at the sight of him. \\n \\n      ﬁSee?ﬂ Harry whispered. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁI can™t see anything.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁLook! Look at them all– there are loads of them–ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁI can only see you.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁLook in it properly, go on, stand where I am.ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, he couldn™t see his family anymore, just \\nRon in his paisley pajamas. \\n \\n      Ron, though, was staring transfixed at his image. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁLook at me!ﬂ he said. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁCan you see all your family standing around you?ﬂ \\n       ﬁNo Š I™m alone Š but I™m different Š I look older Š and I™m head boy!ﬂ \\n       \\n ﬁWhat?ﬂ      \\n   ﬁI am Š I™m wearing the badge like Bill used to Š and I™m holding the house cup and the \\nQuidditch cup Š I™m Quidditch captain, too.ﬂ \\n \\n      Ron tore his eyes away from th\\nis splendid sight to look excitedly at Harry.  \\n      ﬁDo you think this mirror shows the future?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁHow can it? All my family \\nare dead Š let me have another look Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁYou had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit more time.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁYou™re only holding the Quidditch cup, what™s interesting about that? I want to see my \\nparents.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁDon™t push me Šﬂ \\n\\n \\n      A sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion. They hadn™t realized how loudly they had been talking.  \\n      ﬁQuick!ﬂ \\n \\n      Ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes \\nof Mrs. Norris came round the door. \\nRon and Harry stood quite still, both thinking the same thing Š did the cloak work on cats? \\nAfter what seemed an age, she turned and left. \\n \\n      ﬁThis isn™t safe Š she might have\\n gone for Filch, I bet she heard us. Come on.ﬂ \\n \\n      And Ron pulled Harry out of the room. \\n\\n \\n    The snow still hadn™t melted the next morning. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁWant to play chess, Harry?ﬂ said Ron. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁNo.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWhy don™t we go down and visit Hagrid?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁNo– you go–ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁI know what you™re thinking about, Harry, that mirror. Don™t go back tonight.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWhy not?ﬂ \\n      ﬁI dunno, I™ve just got a bad feeling about it Š and anyway, you™ve had too many close shaves \\nalready. Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris are wandering around. So what if they can™t see you? \\nWhat if they walk into you? \\nWhat if you knock something over?ﬂ \\n        ﬁYou sound like Hermione.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁI™m serious, Harry, don™t go.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      But Harry only had one thought in his head, which was to get back in front of the mirror, and \\nRon wasn™t going to stop him. \\n\\n   That third night he found his way more quickly \\nthan before. He was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wi\\nse, but he didn™t meet anyone. \\n \\n      And there were his mother and father sm\\niling at him again, and one of his grandfathers nodding \\nhappily. Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror. There was nothing to stop him \\nfrom staying here all night with his family. Nothing at all. \\n \\n      Except Š \\n \\n      ﬁSo Š back again, Harry?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      Harry felt as though his insides had turned to\\n ice. He looked behind him. Sitting on one of the \\ndesks by the wall was none other than Albus Dumbledore. Harry must have walked straight past \\nhim, so desperate to get to th\\ne mirror he hadn™t noticed him. \\n       ﬁI Š I didn™t see you, sir.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁStrange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,ﬂ said Dumbledore, and Harry was \\nrelieved to see that he was smiling. \\n \\n      ﬁSo,ﬂ said Dumbledore, slipping off the de\\nsk to sit on the floor with Harry, ﬁyou, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁI didn™t know it was called that, Sir.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁBut I expect you™ve realized by now what it does?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁIt Š well Š it shows me my family Šﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁAnd it showed your friend Ron himself as head boy.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁHow did you know Š?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁI don™t need a cloak to become invisibl\\ne,ﬂ said Dumbledore gently. ﬁNow, can you think what \\nthe Mirror of Erised shows us all?ﬂ \\n      Harry shook his head.  \\n      ﬁLet me explain. The happiest man on earth \\nwould be able to use the \\nMirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and \\nsee himself exactly as he is. Does that help?ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry thought. Then he said slowly, ﬁIt shows us what we want– whatever we want–ﬂ  \\n      ﬁYes and no,ﬂ said Dumble\\ndore quietly. ﬁIt shows us nothing more\\n or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have never known your family, see them standing \\naround you. Ronald Weasley, who has always been \\novershadowed by his brothers, sees himself \\nstanding alone, the best of all of them. However,\\n this mirror will give us neither knowledge or \\ntruth. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been driven mad, \\nnot knowing if what it shows is real or even possible.  \\n      ﬁThe Mirror will be moved to a new home\\n tomorrow, Harry, and I ask you not to go looking for \\nit again. If you ever do run across it, you will now \\nbe prepared. It does not do to dwell on dreams \\n\\nand forget to live, remember that. Now, why don™\\nt you put that admirable cloak back on and get \\noff to bed?ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry stood up. \\n \\n      ﬁSir Š Professor Dumb\\nledore? Can I ask you something?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁObviously, you™ve just done so,ﬂ Dumbledore smiled. ﬁYou may ask me one more thing, \\nhowever.ﬂ        ﬁWhat do you see when you look in the mirror?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁI? I see myself holding \\na pair of thick, woolen socks.ﬂ  \\n      Harry stared. \\n \\n      ﬁOne can never have enough socks,ﬂ said Dumbledore. ﬁAnother Christmas has come and gone \\nand I didn™t get a single pair. People\\n will insist on giving me books.ﬂ \\n \\n      It was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that Dumb\\nledore might not have been \\nquite truthful. But then, he thought, as he shove\\nd Scabbers off his pillow, it had been quite a \\npersonal question.  \\n   \\n \\n         CHAPTER THIRTEEN   Nicholas Flamel     Dumbledore had convinced Harry not to go looking\\n for the Mirror of Erised again, and for the rest of the Christmas holidays th\\ne invisibility cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk. \\nHarry wished he could forget what he™d seen in the mirror as easily, but \\nhe couldn™t. He started having nightmares. Over and over again he dreame\\nd about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high voice cackled with laughter. \\n \\n      ﬁYou see, Dumbledore was right, that mi\\nrror could drive you mad,ﬂ said Ron, when Harry told \\nhim about these dreams. \\n \\n      Hermione, who came back the day before te\\nrm started, took a different view of things. She was torn between horror at the idea of Harry being out of bed, roaming the school three nights in a \\nrow (ﬁIf Filch had caught you!ﬂ), and disappointment that he hadn™t at least found out who Nicolas Flamel was. \\n \\n      They had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel in a library book, even though Harry was \\nstill sure he™d read the name somewhere. Once \\nterm had started, they were back to skimming \\nthrough books for ten minutes during their breaks. \\nHarry had even less time than the other two, \\nbecause Quidditch practice had started again. \\n \\n      Wood was working the team harder than ever\\n. Even the endless rain that had replaced the snow couldn™t dampen his spirits. The Weasleys comp\\nlained that Wood was becoming a fanatic, but \\nHarry was on Wood™s side. If they won their \\nnext match, against Hufflepuff, they would \\novertake Slytherin in the house championship for the first time in \\nseven years. Quite apart from \\nwanting to win, Harry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after training. \\n \\n      Then, during one particularly wet and muddy practice session, Wood gave\\n the team a bit of bad news. He™d just gotten very angry with the Weasleys, who kept dive-bombing each other and pretending to fall off their brooms. \\n \\n      ﬁWill you stop messing around!ﬂ he yelled. ﬁThat™\\ns exactly the sort of thing that™ll lose us the \\nmatch! Snape™s refereeing this time, and he™l\\nl be looking for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!ﬂ  \\n      George Weasley really did fall off his broom at these words.  \\n      ﬁSnape™s refereeing?ﬂ he spluttered through a mouthful of mud. ﬁWhe\\nn™s he ever refereed a Quidditch match? He™s not going to be \\nfair if we might overtake Slytherin.ﬂ \\n \\n      The rest of the team lande\\nd next to George to complain, too. \\n \\n      ﬁIt™s not my fault,ﬂ said Wood. ﬁWe™ve just got to make sure we play a clean game, so Snape \\nhasn™t got an excuse to pick on us.ﬂ        Which was all very well, thought Harry, but\\n he had another reason for not wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch–  \\n \\n      The rest of the team hung back to talk to \\none another as usual at the end of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room, where he found Ron and Hermione \\nplaying chess. Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at\\n, something Harry and Ron thought \\nwas very good for her.  \\n      ﬁDon™t talk to me for a moment,ﬂ said \\nRon when Harry sat down next to him, ﬁI need to \\nconcenŠﬂ He caught sight of Harry™s face.  \\n      ﬁWhat™s the matter \\nwith you? You look terrible.ﬂ \\n \\n      Speaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the other two about Snape™s sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee.  \\n      ﬁDon™t play,ﬂ said Hermione at once. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁSay you™re ill,ﬂ said Ron. \\n \\n      ﬁPretend to break your leg,ﬂ Hermione suggested. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁReally break your leg,ﬂ said Ron.        ﬁI can™t,ﬂ said Harry. ﬁThere isn™t a reserve Seeker. If I back out, Gry\\nffindor can™t play at all.ﬂ        At that moment Neville toppled into \\nthe common room. How he had managed to climb through \\nthe portrait hole was anyone™s guess, because his le\\ngs had been stuck together with what they \\nrecognized at once as the Leg-Locker Curse. He must have had to bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor tower.  \\n      Everyone fell over laughing except Hermi\\none, who leapt up and performed the countercurse. \\nNeville™s legs sprang apart and he got to his feet, trembling. ﬁWhat happened?ﬂ Hermione asked \\n\\nhim, leading him over to sit with Harry and Ron. \\n \\n      ﬁMalfoy,ﬂ said Neville shakily. ﬁI met hi\\nm outside the library. He sa\\nid he™d been looking for someone to practice that on.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁGo to Professor McGonagall!ﬂ Hermione urged Neville. ﬁReport him!ﬂ \\n \\n      Neville shook his head. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁI don™t want more trouble,ﬂ he mumbled. \\n       ﬁYou™ve got to stand up to him, Neville!ﬂ \\nsaid Ron. ﬁHe™s used to walking all over people, but \\nthat™s no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier.ﬂ \\n       ﬁThere™s no need to tell me I™m not br\\nave enough to be in Gryffindor, Malfoy™s already done that,ﬂ Neville choked out.  \\n      Harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a Chocolate Frog, the very last one from the \\nbox Hermione had given him for Ch\\nristmas. He gave it to Nev\\nille, who looked as though he might cry. \\n \\n      ﬁYou™re worth twelve of Malfoy,ﬂ Harry said. ﬁThe Sorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor, didn™t it? And where™s Malfoy? In\\n stinking Slytherin.ﬂ  \\n      Neville™s lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frog. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁThanks, Harry– I think I™ll go to bed– D™you want the card, you collect them, don™t you?ﬂ \\n \\n      As Neville walked away, Harry looked at the Famous Wizard card. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁDumbledore again,ﬂ he sa\\nid, ﬁHe was the first one I ever Šﬂ \\n \\n      He gasped. He stared at the back of the card. Then he looked up at Ron and Hermione. \\n \\n      ﬁI™ve found him!ﬂ he whispered. ﬁI™ve found Flamel! I \\ntold you I™d read the name somewhere \\nbefore, I read it on the train coming here Š listen \\nto this: ‚Dumbledore is particularly famous for \\nhis defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in \\n1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon™s blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel™!ﬂ  \\n      Hermione jumped to her feet. She hadn™t l\\nooked so excited since they\\n™d gotten back the marks \\nfor their very first piece of homework. \\n \\n      ﬁStay there!ﬂ she said, and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls™ \\ndormitories. Harry and Ron \\nbarely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back, an enormous old book \\n\\nin her arms. \\n \\n      ﬁI never thought to look in here!ﬂ she whispered excitedly. ﬁI got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁLight?ﬂ said Ron, but Hermione told him to be\\n quiet until she™d looked something up, and \\nstarted flicking frantically through the pages, muttering to herself. \\n \\n      At last she found what she was looking for. \\n \\n      ﬁI knew it! I knew it!ﬂ  \\n      ﬁAre we allowed to speak yet?ﬂ said Ron grumpily. Hermione ignored him. \\n      ﬁNicolas Flamel,ﬂ she whispered dramatically, ﬁ\\nis the only known maker of the Sorcerer™s Stone!ﬂ        This didn™t have quite the effect she™d expected. \\n \\n      ﬁThe what?ﬂ said Harry and Ron. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁOh, honestly, don™t you two read? Look Œ read that, there.ﬂ \\n \\n      She pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Ron read: \\n \\n     The ancient study of alchemy \\nis concerned with making the Sorcerer™s Stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers. The stone wi\\nll transform any metal into pure gold. It also produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal. \\n \\n  There have been many reports of the Sorcerer™s\\n Stone over the centuri\\nes, but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel, who celebrated his six hundred and sixty-fifth \\nbirthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in \\nDevon with his wife, Perenelle (six hundred and fifty-eight). \\n \\n  ﬁSee?ﬂ said Hermione, when Harry and Ron ha\\nd finished. ﬁThe dog must be guarding Flamel™s \\nSorcerer™s Stone! I bet he asked Dumbledore to k\\neep it safe for him, because they™re friends and \\nhe knew someone was after it, that™s why he \\nwanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁA stone that makes gold and stops you from\\n ever dying!ﬂ said Harry. ﬁNo wonder Snape™s after it! Anyone would want it.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁAnd no wonder we couldn™t find Flamel in that \\nStudy of Recent Devel\\nopments in Wizardry\\n,ﬂ said Ron. ﬁHe™s not exactly recent if he™s\\n six hundred and sixty-five, is he?ﬂ \\n \\n  The next morning in Defense Against the Da\\nrk Arts, while copying down different ways of \\ntreating werewolf bites, Harry and Ron were still discussing what they™d do with a Sorcerer™s Stone if they had one. It wasn™t until Ron said he™d buy his own Quidditch team that Harry \\nremembered about Snape and the coming match. \\n \\n      ﬁI™m going to play,ﬂ he told Ron and Hermio\\nne. ﬁIf I don™t, all the Slytherins will think I™m just \\ntoo scared to face Snape. I™ll show them– it™ll re\\nally wipe the smiles off \\ntheir faces if we win.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁJust as long as we™re not wiping you off the field,ﬂ said Hermione. \\n \\n  As the match drew nearer, however, Harry beca\\nme more and more nerv\\nous, whatever he told Ron and Hermione. The rest of the team wasn\\n™t too calm, either. The idea of overtaking \\nSlytherin in the house championship was wonderf\\nul, no one had done it for seven years, but would they be allowed to, with such a biased referee?  \\n      Harry didn™t know whether he was imagining it \\nor not, but he seemed to keep running into Snape \\nwherever he went. At times, he even wondered \\nwhether Snape was following him, trying to catch \\nhim on his own. Potions lessons were turning into a \\nsort of weekly torture, Snape was so horrible \\nto Harry. Could Snape possibly know they™d found out about the Sorcerer™s Stone? Harry didn™t \\nsee how he could Š yet he sometimes had the \\nhorrible feeling that Snape could read minds. \\n \\n  Harry knew, when they wished him good luck ou\\ntside the locker rooms \\nthe next afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether they™d \\never see him alive again. This wasn™t what \\nyou™d call comforting. Harry hardly heard a word \\nof Wood™s pep talk as he pulled on his \\nQuidditch robes and picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand.  \\n      Ron and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a \\nplace in the stands next to Neville, who couldn™t \\nunderstand why they looked so grim and worried, or why they had both brought their wands to the match. Little did Harry know that Ron and He\\nrmione had been secretly practicing the Leg-\\n\\nLocker Curse. They™d gotten the idea from Malfoy\\n using it on Neville, and were ready to use it \\non Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry.  \\n      ﬁNow, don™t forget, it™s Locomotor Mortis,ﬂ Hermione muttered as Ron slipped his wand up his \\nsleeve.  \\n      ﬁI know,ﬂ Ron snapped. ﬁDon™t nag.ﬂ \\n \\n      Back in the locker room, Wood had taken Harry aside. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁDon™t want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever need an early capture of the Snitch it™s now. Finish the game before Snape \\ncan favor Hufflepuff too much.ﬂ \\n       ﬁThe whole school™s out there!ﬂ said Fred Weasley, peering \\nout of the door. ﬁEven Š blimey Š \\nDumbledore™s come to watch!ﬂ \\n       Harry™s heart did a somersault. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁDumbledore?ﬂ he said, dashing to the door to make\\n sure. Fred was right. There was no mistaking that silver beard. \\n \\n      Harry could have laughed out loud with relief, he was safe. There was simply no way that Snape \\nwould dare to try to hurt him if Dumbledore was watching. \\n \\n      Perhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as the teams marched onto the field, \\nsomething that Ron noticed, too. \\n \\n      ﬁI™ve never seen Snape look so mean,ﬂ he told Hermione. ﬁLook Š they™re off. Ouch!ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      Someone had poked Ron in th\\ne back of the head. It was Malfoy.  \\n      ﬁOh, sorry, Weasley, didn™t see you there.ﬂ \\n\\n      Malfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle.        ﬁWonder how long Potter™s going to stay on\\n his broom this time? Anyone want a bet? What \\nabout you, Weasley?ﬂ \\n \\n      Ron didn™t answer; Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff a penalty because George Weasley had \\nhit a Bludger at him. Hermione, who had all her fi\\nngers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry, who was circling the game\\n like a hawk, looking for the Snitch.  \\n      ﬁYou know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team?ﬂ said Malfoy loudly a few \\nminutes later, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff anothe\\nr penalty for no reason at all. ﬁIt™s people they \\nfeel sorry for. See, there™s Potter, who™s got no parents, then there™s the \\nWeasleys, who™ve got no money Š you should be on the team, Longbottom, you™ve got no brains.ﬂ  \\n      Neville went bright red but\\n turned in his seat to face Malfoy. \\n \\n      ﬁI™m worth twelve of you, Malfoy,ﬂ he stammered. \\n\\n \\n      Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still not daring to take his eyes from the game, said, ﬁYou tell him, Neville.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁLongbottom, if brains were gold you™d be \\npoorer than Weasley, and that™s saying something.ﬂ \\n \\n      Ron™s nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about Harry.  \\n      ﬁI™m warning you, Malfoy Š one more wordŠﬂ \\n\\n       ﬁRon!ﬂ said Hermione suddenly, ﬁHarry Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWhat? Where?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      Harry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd. Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her m\\nouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet. \\n \\n      ﬁYou™re in luck, Weasley, Potter™s obvi\\nously spotted some money on the ground!ﬂ said Malfoy. \\n \\n      Ron snapped. Before Malfoy knew what was happening, Ron was on top of him, wrestling him \\nto the ground. Neville hesitated, then clambered over the back of his seat to help. \\n \\n      ﬁCome on, Harry!ﬂ Hermione screamed, leaping \\nonto her seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape Š she didn™t even notice Malfoy and Ron rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle. \\n \\n      Up in the air, Snape turned on his brooms\\ntick just in time to see so\\nmething scarlet shoot past \\nhim, missing him by inches Š the next second, Harry\\n had pulled out of the dive, his arm raised \\nin triumph, the Snitch clasped in his hand. \\n       The stands erupted; it had to be a record, no one could ever remember the Snitch being caught so \\nquickly.  \\n      ﬁRon! Ron! Where are you? The game™s ove\\nr! Harry™s won! We™ve won! Gryffindor is in the \\nlead!ﬂ shrieked Hermione, dancing up and down on \\nher seat and hugging Parvati Patil in the row in front.  \\n      Harry jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground. He coul\\ndn™t believe it. He™d done it Š the game was over; it had barely last\\ned five minutes. As Gryffindor\\ns came spilling onto the field, he \\nsaw Snape land nearby, white-faced and tight-lip\\nped Š then Harry felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up into Dumbledore™s smiling face. \\n \\n      ﬁWell done,ﬂ said Dumbledore quietly, so \\nthat only Harry could hear. ﬁNice to see you haven™t been brooding about that mirror– been keeping busy– excellent–ﬂ \\n \\n      Snape spat bitterly on the ground. \\n \\n  Harry left the locker room alone some time late\\nr, to take his Nimbus Two Thousand back to the \\nbroomshed. He couldn™t ever reme\\nmber feeling happier. He™d really done something to be proud \\nof now Œ no one could say he was just a famous name any more. The evening air had never \\nsmelled so sweet. He walked over the damp grass,\\n reliving the last hour in his head, which was a happy blur: Gryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders; Ron and Hermione in the \\ndistance, jumping up and down, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed. \\n \\n      Harry had reached the shed. He leaned ag\\nainst the wooden door and l\\nooked up at Hogwarts, with its windows glowing red in the setting sun. Gryffindor in the lead. He™d done it, he™d shown Snape–   \\n      And speaking of Snape–  \\n \\n      A hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle. Clearly not wanting to be seen, it walked as fast as possible toward the forbidden forest. Harry™s victory faded from his mind as \\nhe watched. He recognized the figure™s prowling walk. Snape, sneaking into the forest while everyone else was at dinner Š what was going on? \\n \\n      Harry jumped back on his Nimbus Two Thou\\nsand and took off. Gliding silently over the castle \\nhe saw Snape enter the forest at a run. He followed. \\n \\n      The trees were so thick he couldn™t see where Snape had gone. He flew in circles, lower and lower, brushing the top branches of trees until he heard voices. He glided toward them and \\nlanded noiselessly in a towering beech tree.  \\n      He climbed carefully along one of the branches, holding tight to his broomstick, trying to see \\nthrough the leaves.       Below, in a shadowy clearing, stood Snape, but he wasn™t alone. Quirrell was there, too. Harry couldn™t make out the look on his face, but he was \\nstuttering worse than ever. Harry strained to \\ncatch what they were saying.        ﬁ– d-don™t know why you wanted t-t-to meet here of all p-places, Severus–ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁOh, I thought we™d keep this private,ﬂ said Snape, his voice icy. ﬁStu\\ndents aren™t supposed to know about the Sorcerer™s Stone, after all.ﬂ  \\n      Harry leaned forward. Quirrell was mumbling something. Snape interrupted him. \\n \\n      ﬁHave you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid™s yet?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁB-b-but Severus, I Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁYou don™t want me as your enemy, Quirre\\nll,ﬂ said Snape, taking a step toward him.  \\n      ﬁI-I don™t know what youŠﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁYou know perfectly well what I mean.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      An owl hooted loudly, and Harry nearly fell out of the tree. He steadied himself in time to hear \\nSnape say, ﬁŠ your little bit of hocus-pocus. I™m waiting.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁB-but I d-d-don™t Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁVery well,ﬂ Snape cut in. ﬁWe™ll have a\\nnother little chat soon, when you™ve had time to think \\nthings over and decided where your loyalties lie.ﬂ  \\n      He threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing. It was almost dark now, but \\nHarry could see Quirrell, standing quite still as though he was petrified.  \\n  ﬁHarry, where have you \\nbeen?ﬂ Hermione squeaked. \\n \\n      ﬁWe won! You won! We won!ﬂ shouted \\nRon, thumping Harry on the b\\nack. ﬁAnd I gave Malfoy a black eye, and Neville tried to \\ntake on Crabbe and Goyle single-handed! He™s still out cold but \\nMadam Pomfrey says he™ll be all right Š talk \\nabout showing Slytherin!\\n Everyone™s waiting for you in the common room, we™re having a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and stuff \\n\\nfrom the kitchens.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁNever mind that now,ﬂ said Harry brea\\nthlessly. ﬁLet™s find an \\nempty room, you wait ™til you \\nhear this–ﬂ  \\n      He made sure Peeves wasn™t inside before\\n shutting the door behind them, then he told them what \\nhe™d seen and heard.  \\n      ﬁSo we were right, it is the Sorcerer™s Stone, and Snape™s tryi\\nng to force Quirrell to help him get \\nit. He asked if he knew how to get past Fluffy Š and he said something about Quirrell™s ‚hocus \\npocus™ Š I reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from Fluffy, loads of \\nenchantments, probably, and Quirrell would have \\ndone some anti-Dark Arts spell that Snape \\nneeds to break through Šﬂ        ﬁSo you mean the Stone™s only safe as long \\nas Quirrell stands up to Snape?ﬂ said Hermione in \\nalarm. \\n \\n      ﬁIt™ll be gone by next Tuesday,ﬂ said Ron. \\n \\n   \\n \\n         \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n CHAPTER FOURTEEN \\n  Norbert the Norwegian Ridgeback \\n \\n  Quirrell, however, must have been braver than \\nthey™d thought. In the weeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner, but\\n it didn™t look as though he™d cracked yet.  \\n      Every time they passed the third-floor co\\nrridor, Harry, Ron, and Hermione would press their ears \\nto the door to check that Fluffy was still growli\\nng inside. Snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper, which surely meant that the Stone wa\\ns still safe. Whenever Harry passed Quirrell these days he gave him an encouraging sort of \\nsmile, and Ron had started telling people off for \\n\\nlaughing at Quirrell™s stutter.  \\n      Hermione, however, had more on her mind th\\nan the Sorcerer™s Stone. She had started drawing up study schedules and color coding all her notes. Harry and Ron wouldn™t have minded, but she \\n\\nkept nagging them to do the same. \\n \\n      ﬁHermione, the exams are ages away.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁTen weeks,ﬂ Hermione snapped. ﬁThat™s \\nnot ages, that™s like a second to Nicolas Flamel.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁBut we™re not six hundred years old,ﬂ Ron reminded her. ﬁAnyway, what are you studying for, \\nyou already know it™s an A.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁWhat am I studying for? \\nAre you crazy? You realize \\nwe need to pass these exams to get into the \\nsecond year? They™re very important, I should have started studying a month ago, I don™t know \\n\\nwhat™s gotten into me–ﬂ \\n \\n      Unfortunately, the teachers seemed to be th\\ninking along the same lines as Hermione. They piled \\nso much homework on them that the Easter \\nholidays weren™t nearly as much fun as the \\nChristmas ones. It was hard to relax with Herm\\nione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragon™s blood or practicing wand movements.\\n Moaning and yawning, Harry and Ron spent most of their free time in the library with he\\nr, trying to get through all their extra work.  \\n      ﬁI™ll never remember this,ﬂ Ron burs\\nt out one afternoon, throwing down his quill and looking longingly out of the library window. It was the first really fine day they™d had in months. The sky \\nwas a clear, forget-me-not blue, and there \\nwas a feeling in the air of summer coming. \\n \\n      Harry, who was looking up ﬁDittanyﬂ in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi, didn™t look up until he heard Ron say, ﬁHagrid! What are you doing in the library?ﬂ \\n \\n      Hagrid shuffled into view, hiding somethi\\nng behind his back. He looked very out of place in his \\nmoleskin overcoat.  \\n      ﬁJus™ lookin™,ﬂ he said, in a shifty voice that got their interest at once. ﬁAn™ what™re you lot up ter?ﬂ He looked suddenly suspicious. ﬁYer not\\n still lookin™ fer Nicolas Flamel, are yeh?ﬂ \\n       ﬁOh, we found out who he is ages ago,ﬂ said Ron impressively. ﬁA\\nnd we know what that dog™s guarding, it™s a Sorcerer™s StŠﬂ  \\n      ﬁShhhh!ﬂ Hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening. ﬁDon™ go shoutin™ about it, what™s the matter with yeh?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁThere are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of fact,ﬂ\\n said Harry, ﬁabout what™s guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁSHHHH!ﬂ said Hagrid again. ﬁListen Š come\\n an™ see me later, I™m not promisin™ I™ll tell yeh \\nanythin™, mind, but don™ go rabbitin™ \\nabout it in here, students aren™ s™pposed ter know. They™ll \\nthink I™ve told yeh Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁSee you later, then,ﬂ said Harry. \\n \\n      Hagrid shuffled off. \\n \\n      ﬁWhat was he hiding behind \\nhis back?ﬂ said Hermione thoughtfully. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁDo you think it had anything to do with the Stone?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁI™m going to see what section he was \\nin,ﬂ said Ron, who™d had enough of working. He came \\nback a minute later with a pile\\n of books in his arms and slammed them down on the table. \\n      ﬁDragons!ﬂ he whispered. ﬁHagrid was looking up stuff about dragons! Look at these: Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland; From Egg to Inferno, A Dragon Keeper™s Guide. ﬂ  \\n      ﬁHagrid™s always wanted a dragon, he told me so the first time I ever met him, ﬁ said Harry. \\n \\n      ﬁBut it™s against our laws,ﬂ said Ron. ﬁDragon breeding was outlawed by the Warlocks™ \\nConvention of 1709, everyone knows that. It™s hard to stop Muggles from noticing us if we™re keeping dragons in the back garden Š anyway, you can™t tame dragons, it™s dangerous. You \\nshould see the burns Charlie™s got off wild ones in Romania.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁBut there aren™t wild dragons in Britain?ﬂ said Harry.  \\n      ﬁOf course there are,ﬂ said Ron. ﬁCommon Welsh Green and He\\nbridean Blacks. The Ministry of Magic has a job hushing them up, I can tell \\nyou. Our kind have to keep putting spells on \\n\\nMuggles who™ve spotted them, to make them forget.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁSo what on earth™s Hagrid up to?ﬂ said Hermione. \\n\\n \\n  When they knocked on the door of the gamekeeper™s\\n hut an hour later, they were surprised to see that all the curtains were close\\nd. Hagrid called ﬁWho is it?ﬂ before\\n he let them in, and then shut \\nthe door quickly behind them. \\n      It was stifling hot inside. Even though it was such a warm day, there was a blazing fire in the \\ngrate. Hagrid made them tea and offered th\\nem stoat sandwiches, which they refused. \\n       ﬁSo Š yeh wanted to ask me somethin™?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁYes,ﬂ said Harry. There was no point\\n beating around the bush. ﬁWe were wondering if you \\ncould tell us what™s guarding the Sorcerer™s Stone apart from Fluffy.ﬂ  \\n      Hagrid frowned at him. \\n \\n      ﬁO™ course I can™t,ﬁ he said. ﬁNumber one, I don™ know meself. Number two, yeh know too \\nmuch already, so I wouldn™ tell yeh if I could. That Stone™s here fer a good reason. It was almost \\nstolen outta Gringotts Š I s™ppose yeh™ve worked that out an™ all? Beats me how yeh even know \\nabou™ Fluffy.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁOh, come on, Hagrid, you mi\\nght not want to tell us, but you do know, you know everything that goes on round here,ﬂ said Hermione in a warm, \\nflattering voice. Hagrid\\n™s beard twitched and they could tell he was smiling. ﬁWe only wondered who had \\ndone the guarding, really.ﬂ Hermione went on. ﬁWe wondered who Dumbledore \\nhad trusted enough to help him, apart from \\nyou.ﬂ  \\n      Hagrid™s chest swelled at these last words. Harry and Ron beamed at Hermione. \\n \\n      ﬁWell, I don™ s™pose it co\\nuld hurt ter tell yeh that– let™s see– he borrowed Fluffy from me– \\nthen some o™ the teachers did enchantments\\n– Professor Sprout Š Professor Flitwick Š \\nProfessor McGonagall Šﬂ he ticked them off on his fingers, ﬁProfessor Quirrell Š an™ \\nDumbledore himself did somethin™, o™ cour\\nse. Hang on, I™ve forgotten someone. Oh yeah, \\nProfessor Snape.ﬂ        ﬁSnape?ﬂ  \\n      ﬁYeah Š yer not still on abou™ that, are yeh? Look, Snape helped \\nprotect the Stone, he™s not about ter steal it.ﬂ  \\n      Harry knew Ron and Hermione were thinki\\nng the same as he was. If Snape had been in on \\nprotecting the Stone, it must have been easy to fi\\nnd out how the other teachers had guarded it. He \\nprobably knew everything Š except, it seemed, Qu\\nirrell™s spell and how to get past Fluffy. \\n \\n      ﬁYou™re the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy. aren™t you, Hagrid?ﬂ said Harry \\nanxiously. ﬁAnd you wouldn™t tell anyone, would you? Not even one of the teachers?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁNot a soul knows except me \\nan™ Dumbledore,ﬂ said Hagrid proudly. \\n \\n      ﬁWell, that™s something,ﬂ Harry muttered \\nto the others. ﬁHagrid, can we have a window open? \\nI™m boiling.ﬂ \\n       ﬁCan™t, Harry, sorry,ﬂ said Hagrid. Harry noticed him glance at the fire. Harry looked at it, too. \\n       ﬁHagrid Š what™s that\\n?ﬂ  \\n      But he already knew what it was. In the very heart of the fire, underneath the kettle, was a huge, black egg.  \\n      ﬁAh,ﬂ said Hagrid, fiddling nervously with his beard, ﬁThat™s Š er–ﬂ  \\n      ﬁWhere did you get it, Hagrid?ﬂ said Ron, crou\\nching over the fire to get a closer look at the egg. ﬁIt must™ve cost you a fortune.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWon it,ﬂ said Hagrid. ﬁLas™ night. I was down\\n in the village havin™ a \\nfew drinks an™ got into a game o™ cards with a stranger. Think he was \\nquite glad ter get rid of it, ter be honest.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁBut what are you going to do with it when it™s hatched?ﬂ said Hermione. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁWell, I™ve bin doin™ some readin™,ﬂ sa\\nid Hagrid, pulling a large book from under his pillow. \\nﬁGot this outta the library ŠDragon Breeding for Pleasure and Profit Š it™s a bit outta date, o™ course, but it™s all in here. Keep the egg in the fire, ‚cause thei\\nr mothers breathe on I em, see, an™ \\nwhen it hatches, feed it on a bucket o™ brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour. An™ see \\n\\nhere Š how ter recognize diff™rent eggs Š what I got there™s a Norwegian Ridgeback. They™re rare, them.ﬂ \\n \\n      He looked very pleased with himself, but Hermione didn™t. \\n\\n       ﬁHagrid, you live in a wooden house,ﬂ she said.        But Hagrid wasn™t listening. He was humming merrily as\\n he stoked the fire.  \\n  So now they had something else to worry a\\nbout: what might happen to Hagrid if anyone found \\nout he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut.  \\n      ﬁWonder what it™s like to have a peaceful\\n life,ﬂ Ron sighed, as evening after evening they \\nstruggled through all the extra homework they \\nwere getting. Hermione had now started making \\nstudy schedules for Harry and Ron, too. It was driving them nuts. \\n \\n      Then, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought \\nHarry another note from Hagrid. He had written only \\ntwo words: It™s hatching.  \\n      Ron wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to the hut. Hermione wouldn™t hear of it. \\n \\n      ﬁHermione, how many times in our liv\\nes are we going to see a dragon hatching?ﬂ  \\n      ﬁWe™ve got lessons, we™ll get into trouble, \\nand that™s nothing to what Hagrid™s going to be in when someone finds out\\n what he™s doingŠﬂ       ﬁShut up!ﬂ Harry whispered.  \\n      Malfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen. How much had he heard? \\nHarry didn™t like the look \\non Malfoy™s face at all. \\n  \\n      Ron and Hermione argued all the way to \\nHerbology and in the end, Hermione agreed to run \\ndown to Hagrid™s with the other two during morning break. When the bell sounded from the \\ncastle at the end of their lesson, the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest. Hagrid greeted them, looking flushed and excited. \\n \\n      ﬁIt™s nearly out.ﬂ He ushered them inside. \\n \\n      The egg was lying on the table. There we\\nre deep cracks in it. Some\\nthing was moving inside; a \\nfunny clicking noise was coming from it. \\n \\n      They all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated breath.  \\n      All at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open. The baby dragon flopped onto the table. It wasn™t exactly pretty; Harry thought it looked like a crumpled, black umbrella. Its spiny \\nwings were huge compared to its \\nskinny jet body, it had a long snout with wide nostrils, the stubs of horns and bulging, orange eyes.  \\n      It sneezed. A couple of sparks flew out of its snout. \\n \\n      ﬁIsn™t he beautiful?ﬂ Hagrid murmured. He reached out a \\nhand to stroke the dragon™s head. It \\nsnapped at his fingers, showing pointed fangs.  \\n      ﬁBless him, look, he knows his mommy!ﬂ said Hagrid. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁHagrid,ﬂ said Hermione, ﬁhow fast do Norwegian Ridge\\nbacks grow, exactly?ﬂ \\n \\n      Hagrid was about to answer when the color \\nsuddenly drained from his face Š he leapt to his feet \\nand ran to the window.  \\n      ﬁWhat™s the matter?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁSomeone was lookin™ through the gap in th\\ne curtains Š it™s a kid Š he™s runnin™ back up ter the school.ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry bolted to the door and looked out. Even at a distance there was no mistaking him. \\n \\n      Malfoy had seen the dragon. \\n \\n  Something about the smile lurking on Malfoy™\\ns face during the next week made Harry, Ron, and \\nHermione very nervous. They spent most of thei\\nr free time in Hagrid™s darkened hut, trying to \\nreason with him. \\n      ﬁJust let him go,ﬂ \\nHarry urged. ﬁSet him free.ﬂ \\n       ﬁI can™t,ﬂ said Hagrid. ﬁHe™s too little. He™d die.ﬂ  \\n      They looked at the dragon. It had grown three times in length in just \\na week. Smoke kept furling \\nout of its nostrils. Hagrid hadn™t been doing his gamekeeping duties because the dragon was \\nkeeping him so busy. There were empty brandy bo\\nttles and chicken feathers all over the floor.  \\n      ﬁI™ve decided to call him Norbert,ﬂ said\\n Hagrid, looking at the dragon with misty eyes. ﬁHe \\nreally knows me now, watch. Norb\\nert! Norbert! Where™s Mommy?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁHe™s lost his marble\\ns,ﬂ Ron muttered in Harry™s ear. \\n \\n      ﬁHagrid,ﬂ said Harry loudly, ﬁgive it two weeks and Norbert™s going to be as long as your house. Malfoy could go to Dumbledore at any moment.ﬂ \\n \\n      Hagrid bit his lip. \\n \\n      ﬁI Š I know I can™t keep him fore\\nver, but I can™t jus™ dump him, I can™t.ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry suddenly turned to Ron. ﬁCharlie.ﬂ he said. \\n \\n      ﬁYou™re losing it, too,ﬂ said Ron. ﬁI™m Ron, remember?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁNo Š Charlie Š your brother, Charlie. In Romania. Studying dragons\\n. We could send Norbert \\nto him. Charlie can take care of him \\nand then put him back in the wild!ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁBrilliant!ﬂ said Ron. ﬁHow about it, Hagrid?ﬂ \\n \\n      And in the end, Hagrid agreed that they could send an owl to Charlie to ask him. \\n \\n    The following week dragged by. Wednesday ni\\nght found Hermione and Harry sitting alone in \\nthe common room, long after everyone else had \\ngone to bed. The clock on the wall had just chimed midnight when the portrait hole burst op\\nen. Ron appeared out of nowhere as he pulled off Harry™s invisibility cloak. He had been down at Hagrid™s hut, helping him feed Norbert, who \\n\\nwas now eating dead rats by the crate.  \\n      ﬁIt bit me!ﬂ he said, showing them his hand, which was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief. ﬁI™m \\nnot going to be able to hold a quill for a week. I tell you, that dragon™s the most horrible animal \\nI™ve ever met, but the way Hagrid goes on about it, you™d think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit. \\n\\nWhen it bit me he told me off for frightening \\nit. And when I left, he was singing it a lullaby.ﬂ  \\n      There was a tap on the dark window. \\n \\n      ﬁIt™s Hedwig!ﬂ said Harry, hurrying to let her in. ﬁShe™ll have Charlie™s answer!ﬂ        The three of them put thei\\nr heads together to read the note. \\n        Dear Ron,  \\n  How are you? Thanks for the letter Š I™d be gl\\nad to take the Norwegian Ridgeback, but it won™t be easy getting him here. I think the best thing will be to send him over with some friends of mine who are coming to visit me next week. Trouble is, they mustn™t be seen carrying an illegal dragon.  \\n  Could you get the Ridgeback \\nup the tallest tower at midnight on Saturday? They can meet you there and take him away while it™s still dark. \\n \\n  Send me an answer as soon as possible. \\n\\n \\n  Love, \\n\\n \\n  Charlie \\n    They looked at one another. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁWe™ve got the invisibility\\n cloak,ﬂ said Harry. ﬁIt shouldn™t be too difficult Œ I think the cloaks big enough to cover two of us and Norbert.ﬂ  \\n      It was a mark of how bad the last week had \\nbeen that the other two agr\\need with him. Anything to get rid of Norbert Š and Malfoy.      There was a hitch. By the next morning, Ron™s \\nbitten hand had swollen to twice its usual size. He didn™t know whether it was safe to go to Madam Pomfrey Š would she recognize a dragon bite? \\nBy the afternoon, though, he had no choice. The cut had turned a nasty shade of green. It looked as if Norbert™s fangs were poisonous.        Harry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital \\nwing at the end of the day to find Ron in a terrible state in bed.  \\n      ﬁIt™s not just my hand,ﬂ he whispered, ﬁaltho\\nugh that feels like it™s about to fall off. Malfoy told \\nMadam Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh \\n\\nat me. He kept threatening to \\ntell her what really bit me Š I™ve told her it was a dog, but I don™t \\nthink she believes me Š I shouldn™t have hit hi\\nm at the Quidditch match, that™s why he™s doing \\nthis.ﬂ  \\n      Harry and Hermi\\none tried to calm Ron down.  \\n      ﬁIt™ll all be over at midnight on Saturday,ﬂ sa\\nid Hermione, but this didn™t soothe Ron at all. On \\nthe contrary, he sat bolt upright and broke into a sweat.  \\n      ﬁMidnight on Saturday!ﬂ he said in a hoarse voice. ﬁOh no oh no Š I™ve just remembered Š \\nCharlie™s letter was in that book Malfoy took, he™s going to know we™re getting rid of Norbert.ﬂ        Harry and Hermione didn™t get a chance to\\n answer. Madam Pomfrey came over at that moment \\nand made them leave, saying Ron needed sleep. \\n \\n    ﬁIt™s too late to change the plan now,ﬂ \\nHarry told Hermione. ﬁWe haven™t got time to send \\nCharlie another owl, and this could be our only chance to get rid of Norbert. We™ll have to risk it. \\nAnd we have got the invisibility cloak, Malfoy doesn™t know about that.ﬂ \\n \\n      They found Fang, the boarhound, sitting outside with a bandaged tail when they went to tell Hagrid, who opened a window to talk to them. \\n \\n      ﬁI won™t let you in,ﬂ he puffed. ﬁNorbert™s at a tricky stage Š nothin™ I can™t handle.ﬂ  \\n      When they told him about Charlie™s letter, \\nhis eyes filled with tears, although that might have \\nbeen because Norbert had just bitten him on the leg. \\n \\n      ﬁAargh! It™s all right, he only got my boot Š jus™ playin™ Š he™s only a baby, after all.ﬂ  \\n      The baby banged its tail on the wall, ma\\nking the windows rattle. Harry and Hermione walked \\nback to the castle feeling Saturday couldn™t come quickly enough. \\n \\n    They would have felt sorry for Hagrid when \\nthe time came for him to say good-bye to Norbert if \\nthey hadn™t been so worried about what they had to do. It was a very dark, cloudy night, and they \\nwere a bit late arriving at Hagrid™s hut because th\\ney™d had to wait for Peeves to get out of their \\nway in the entrance hall, where he™d been play\\ning tennis against the wall. Hagrid had Norbert \\npacked and ready in a large crate.  \\n      ﬁHe™s got lots o™ rats an™ some brandy fer \\nthe journey,ﬂ said Hagrid in a muffled voice. ﬁAn™ I™ve \\npacked his teddy bear in case he gets lonely.ﬂ  \\n      From inside the crate came ripping noises th\\nat sounded to Harry as though the teddy was having his head torn off.  \\n      ﬁBye-bye, Norbert!ﬂ Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and Hermione cove\\nred the crate with the invisibility cloak and stepped underneath it \\nthemselves. ﬁMommy will never forget you!ﬂ \\n \\n      How they managed to get the crate back\\n up to the castle, they never knew. Midnight ticked nearer as they heaved Norbert up the marble st\\naircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors. Up another staircase, then another Œ \\neven one of Harry™s shortcuts didn™t make the work much easier. \\n \\n      ﬁNearly there!ﬂ Harry panted as they reached the corridor ben\\neath the tallest tower. \\n \\n      Then a sudden movement ahead of them made\\n them almost drop the crate. Forgetting that they \\nwere already invisible, they shrank into the shad\\nows, staring at the dark outlines of two people \\ngrappling with each other ten \\nfeet away. A lamp flared. \\n       Professor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe\\n and a hair net, had Malfoy by the ear.  \\n      ﬁDetention!ﬂ she shouted. ﬁAnd twenty points from Slytherin! Wandering around in the middle \\nof the night, how dare you Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁYou don™t understand, Professor. Harry Potter™s coming Š he™s got a dragon!ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁWhat utter rubbish! How dare you tell such\\n lies! Come on Š I shall see Professor Snape about \\nyou, Malfoy!ﬂ  \\n      The steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed \\nthe easiest thing in the world after \\nthat. Not until they™d stepped out into the cold night air did they throw off the cloak, glad to be able to breathe properly again. Hermione did a sort of jig. \\n \\n      ﬁMalfoy™s got detention! I could sing!ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁDon™t,ﬂ Harry advised her. \\n \\n      Chuckling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbert thrashing about in his crate. About ten minutes \\nlater, four broomsticks came swooping down out of the darkness. \\n \\n      Charlie™s friends were a cheery lot. They showed Harry and Hermione the harness they™d rigged \\nup, so they could suspend Norbert between them. \\nThey all helped buckle Norbert safely into it and then Harry and Hermione shook hands with\\n the others and thanked them very much. \\n \\n      At last, Norbert was going– going– gone.  \\n      They slipped back down the spiral staircase, their hearts as light as their hands, now that Norbert \\nwas off them. No more dragon Š Malfoy in de\\ntention Š what could spoil their happiness? \\n \\n      The answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs. As they stepped into the corridor, Filch™s face loomed suddenly out of the darkness. \\n \\n      ﬁWell, well, well,ﬂ he whispered, ﬁwe \\nare in trouble.ﬂ  \\n      They™d left the invisibility cloak on top of the tower. \\n \\n          \\n CHAPTER FIFTEEN   The Forbidden Forest  \\n  Things couldn™t have been worse. \\n\\n \\n      Filch took them down to Professor McGonagall™s study on the first floor, where they sat and \\nwaited without saying a word to each other. Hermione was trembling. Excuses, alibis, and wild \\ncover- up stories chased each other around Harry™s \\nbrain, each more feeble than the last. He \\ncouldn™t see how they were going to get out of trouble this time. They were cornered. How could they have been so stupid as to forget the cloak? There was no reason on earth that Professor \\nMcGonagall would accept for their being out of\\n bed and creeping around the school in the dead \\nof night, let alone being up the tallest astronomy tower, which was out-of-bounds except for \\nclasses. Add Norbert and the invisibility cloak, and they might as well \\nbe packing their bags already.  \\n      Had Harry thought that things couldn™t have been worse? He was wrong. When Professor \\nMcGonagall appeared, she was leading Neville. \\n \\n      ﬁHarry!ﬂ Neville burst out, the moment he \\nsaw the other two. ﬁI was trying to find you to warn \\nyou, I heard Malfoy saying he was going to catch you, he said you had a dragŠﬂ  \\n      Harry shook his head violently to shut Neville up, but Professor McGonagall had seen. She looked more likely to breathe fire than Norb\\nert as she towered over the three of them. \\n       ﬁI would never have believed it of any of you. Mr. Filch says you were up in the astronomy \\ntower. It™s one o™clock in the morning. \\nExplain yourselves.ﬂ        It was the first time Hermione had ever fail\\ned to answer a teacher™s \\nquestion. She was staring at \\nher slippers, as still as a statue.  \\n      ﬁI think I™ve got a good idea of what™s been going on,ﬂ said Professor McGonagall. ﬁIt doesn™t take a genius to work it out. You fed Draco Malfoy some cock-and-bull story about a dragon, \\ntrying to get him out of bed and into trouble. I™ve already caught him. I suppose you think it™s \\n\\nfunny that Longbottom here heard th\\ne story and believed it, too?ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry caught Neville™s eye and tried to tell him without words that this wasn™t true, because \\nNeville was looking stunned and hurt. Poor, blundering Neville Š Harry knew what it must have \\n\\ncost him to try and find them in the dark, to warn them. \\n \\n      ﬁI™m disgusted,ﬂ said Professor McGonagall\\n. ﬁFour students out of bed in one night! I™ve never heard of such a thing before! You, Miss Granger, I thought you had more sense. As for you, Mr. \\n\\nPotter, I thought Gryffindor meant more to you than\\n this. All three of you will receive detentions \\nŠ yes, you too, Mr. Longbottom, \\nnothing gives you the right to walk around school at night, especially these days, it™s very dangerous Š \\nand fifty points will be taken from Gryffindor.ﬂ \\n      ﬁFifty?ﬂ Harry gasped Š they would lose the lea\\nd, the lead he™d won in the last Quidditch match. \\n       ﬁFifty points each\\n,ﬂ said Professor McGonagall, breathing heavily through her long, pointed nose.   \\n      ﬁProfessor Š please Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁYou can™t Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁDon™t tell me what I can and can™t do, Pott\\ner. Now get back to bed, all of you. I™ve never been more ashamed of Gryffindor students.ﬂ  \\n      A hundred and fifty points lost. That put Gryffindor in last place. In one night, they™d ruined any \\nchance Gryffindor had had for the house cup. Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of \\nhis stomach. How could they ever make up for this? \\n \\n      Harry didn™t sleep all night. He could hear Neville sobbing into his pillow for what seemed like \\nhours. Harry couldn™t think of anything to say to comfort him. He knew Neville, like himself, \\nwas dreading the dawn. What would happen when the rest of Gryffindor found out what they™d \\n\\ndone? \\n \\n    At first, Gryffindors passing the giant hourgl\\nasses that recorded the house points the next day thought there™d been a mistake. How could they\\n suddenly have a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday? And then the story started to sp\\nread: Harry Potter, the famous Harry Potter, their \\nhero of two Quidditch matches, had lost them a\\nll those points, him and a couple of other stupid \\nfirst years.  \\n      From being one of the most popular and \\nadmired people at the school, Harry was suddenly the \\nmost hated. Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs turned on him, because everyone had been \\nlonging to see Slytherin lose the house cup. Everywhere Harry went, people pointed and didn™t trouble to lower their voices as they insulted him. Slytherins, on the ot\\nher hand, clapped as he walked past them, whistling and chee\\nring, ﬁThanks Potter, we owe you one!ﬂ   \\n      Only Ron stood by him. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁThey™ll all forget this in a few weeks. Fred and George have lost loads of points in all the time they™ve been here, and people still like them.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁThey™ve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go, though, have they?ﬂ said Harry \\nmiserably. \\n \\n      ﬁWell Š no,ﬂ Ron admitted. \\n\\n \\n      It was a bit late to repair the damage, but Harry swore to himself not to meddle in things that \\nweren™t his business from now on. He™d had it with sneaking around and spying. He felt so ashamed of himself that he went to Wood a\\nnd offered to resign from the Quidditch team. \\n       ﬁResign?ﬂ Wood thundered. ﬁWhat good™ll that do? How ar\\ne we going to get any points back if we can™t win at Quidditch?ﬂ         \\n      But even Quidditch had lost its fun. The rest of the team wouldn™t speak to Harry during \\npractice, and if they had to speak about him, they called him ﬁthe Seeker.ﬂ \\n \\n      Hermione and Neville were suffering, too. They\\n didn™t have as bad a time as Harry, because they \\nweren™t as well-known, but nobody would speak to them, either. Hermione had stopped drawing \\nattention to herself in class, keeping \\nher head down and working in silence.  \\n      Harry was almost glad that the exams were\\nn™t far away. All the studying he had to do kept his mind off his misery. He, Ron, and \\nHermione kept to themselves, \\nworking late into the night, trying to remember the ingredients in complicated\\n potions, learn charms and spells by heart, \\nmemorize the dates of magical disc\\noveries and goblin rebellions–   \\n      Then, about a week before the exams were due\\n to start, Harry™s new resolution not to interfere in anything that didn™t concern him was put to an un\\nexpected test. Walking back from the library \\non his own one afternoon, he heard somebody wh\\nimpering from a classroom up ahead. As he \\ndrew closer, he heard Quirrell™s voice. \\n \\n      ﬁNo Š no Š not again, please Šﬂ \\n \\n      It sounded as though someone \\nwas threatening him. \\nHarry moved closer. \\n       ﬁAll right Š all right Šﬂ he heard Quirrell sob.        Next second, Quirrell came hurrying out of \\nthe classroom stra\\nightening his turban. He was pale and looked as though he was about to cry. He strode out of sight; Harry didn™t think Quirrell had even noticed him. He waited until Quirrell™s f\\nootsteps had disappeared, then peered into the \\nclassroom. It was empty, but a door stood ajar at \\nthe other end. Harry was halfway toward it before he remembered what he™d promised himself about not meddling. \\n \\n      All the same, he™d have gambled twelve Sorc\\nerer™s Stones that Snape ha\\nd just left the room, and \\nfrom what Harry had just heard, Snape would \\nbe walking with a new spring in his step Š Quirrell seemed to have given in at last. \\n \\n      Harry went back to the library, where He\\nrmione was testing Ron on Astronomy. Harry told them \\nwhat he™d heard.  \\n      ﬁSnape™s done it, then!ﬂ said Ron. ﬁIf Quirrell™s told him how to break\\n his Anti-Dark Force spell Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁThere™s still Fluffy, though,ﬂ said Hermione. \\n\\n        ﬁMaybe Snape™s found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid,ﬂ said Ron, looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them. ﬁI bet there™s a book somewhere in here telling you \\nhow to get past a giant three-headed dog. So what do we do, Harry?ﬂ \\n \\n      The light of adventure was kindling again in Ron™s eyes, but Hermione\\n answered before Harry could.  \\n      ﬁGo to Dumbledore. That™s what we shoul\\nd have done ages ago. If we try anything ourselves we™ll be thrown out for sure.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁBut we™ve got no proof!ﬂ said Harry. ﬁQuirrell™s too scared to back us up. Snape™s only got to say he doesn™t know how the troll got in at Halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor Š who do you think they™ll believe, him or us\\n? It™s not exactly a se\\ncret we hate him, \\nDumbledore™ll think we made it up to get him sacke\\nd. Filch wouldn™t help us if his life depended on it, he™s too friendly with Snape, and the more\\n students get thrown out, the better, he™ll think. And don™t forget, we™re not supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy. That™ll take a lot of explaining.ﬂ   \\n      Hermione looked convinced, but Ron didn™t. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁIf we just do a bit of poking around Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁNo,ﬂ said Harry flatly, ﬁwe™ve done enough poking around.ﬂ \\n \\n      He pulled a map of Jupiter toward hi\\nm and started to learn the names of its moons. \\n     The following morning, notes were delivered \\nto Harry, Hermione, and Neville at the breakfast table. They were all the same: \\n   Your detention will take pla\\nce at eleven o™clock tonight. \\n   Meet Mr. Filch in the entrance hall. \\n\\n \\n    Professor McGonagall \\n     Harry had forgotten they still had detentions to\\n do in the furor over the points they™d lost. He half \\nexpected Hermione to complain that this was \\na whole night of studying lost, but she didn™t say a word. Like Harry, she felt they deserved what they™d got.  \\n      At eleven o™clock that night, they said good-bye to Ron in the common room and went down to \\nthe entrance hall with Neville. Filch was already there Š and so was Malfoy. Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy had gotten a detention, too.  \\n      ﬁFollow me,ﬂ said Filch, li\\nghting a lamp and leading them outside. \\n \\n      ﬁI bet you™ll think twice about breaking a school rule again, won™t you, eh?ﬂ he said, leering at them. ﬁOh yes– hard work and pain are the best t\\neachers if you ask me– It™s\\n just a pity they let the old punishments die out– hang you by your wris\\nts from the ceiling for a few days, I™ve got \\nthe chains still in my office, keep ‚em well oile\\nd in case they™re ever needed– Right, off we go, \\nand don™t think of running off, now, it™ll be worse for you if you do.ﬂ         They marched off across the dark grounds\\n. Neville kept sniffing. Harry wondered what their punishment was going to be. It must be somethi\\nng really horrible, or Filch wouldn™t be sounding so delighted. \\n \\n      The moon was bright, but clouds scudding \\nacross it kept throwing them into darkness. Ahead, \\nHarry could see the lighted windows of Hagrid™s hut. Then they heard a distant shout.  \\n      ﬁIs that you, Filch? Hu\\nrry up, I want ter get started.ﬂ  \\n      Harry™s heart rose; if they were going to be working with Hagrid it w\\nouldn™t be so bad. His relief must have showed in his face, because Filc\\nh said, ﬁI suppose you think you™ll be enjoying \\nyourself with that oaf? Well, \\nthink again, boy Š it™s into the forest you™re going and I™m much \\nmistaken if you™ll all come out in one piece.ﬂ \\n \\n      At this, Neville let out a little\\n moan, and Malfoy stopped dead in his tracks. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁThe forest?ﬂ he repeated, and he didn™t sou\\nnd quite as cool as usual. ﬁWe can™t go in there at \\nnight Š there™s all sorts of things in there Š werewolves, I heard.ﬂ  \\n      Neville clutched the sleeve of\\n Harry™s robe and made a choking noise. \\n       ﬁThat™s your problem, isn™t it?ﬂ said Filch, his voice cracki\\nng with glee. ﬁShould™ve thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble, shouldn™t you?ﬂ \\n       Hagrid came striding toward them out of\\n the dark, Fang at his heel. He was carrying his large \\ncrossbow, and a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulder.  \\n      ﬁAbou™ time,ﬂ he said. ﬁI bin waitin™ fe\\nr half an hour already. All right, Harry, Hermione?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁI shouldn™t be too friendly to them, Hagri\\nd,ﬂ said Filch coldly, ﬁthey™re here to be punished, after all.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁThat™s why yer late, is it?ﬂ said Hagrid, frowning at Filch. ﬁBin lecturin™ them, eh? ‚Snot your \\nplace ter do that. Yeh™ve done yer b\\nit, I™ll take over from here.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁI™ll be back at dawn,ﬂ said Filch, ﬁfor what™s left of them,ﬂ he added nastily, and he turned and \\nstarted back toward the castle, his lamp bobbing away in the darkness.  \\n      Malfoy now turned to Hagrid. \\n \\n      ﬁI™m not going in that forest,ﬂ he said, a\\nnd Harry was pleased to hear the note of panic in his voice.          ﬁYeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts,ﬂ said Hagrid fiercely. ﬁYeh™ve done wrong an™ now yeh™ve got ter pay fer it.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁBut this is servant stuff, it™s not for students to do. I thought we™d be copying lines or something, if my father kne\\nw I was doing this, he™dŠﬂ  \\n      ﬁŠtell yer that™s how it is at Hogwarts,ﬂ Hagrid growled. ﬁCopyin™ lines! What good™s that ter \\nanyone? Yeh™ll do summat useful or \\nyeh™ll get out. If yeh think yer father™d rather you were expelled, then get back off ter the castle an™ pack. Go on.ﬂ  \\n      Malfoy didn™t move. He looked at \\nHagrid furiously, but then dropped his gaze. \\n \\n      ﬁRight then,ﬂ said Hagrid, ﬁnow, liste\\nn carefully, ‚cause it™s dangerous what we™re gonna do tonight, an™ I don™ want no one takin™ risks. Follow me over here a moment.ﬂ \\n \\n      He led them to the very edge of the fore\\nst. Holding his lamp up high, he pointed down a narrow, winding earth track that disappeared into the thick \\nblack trees. A light breeze lifted their hair as \\nthey looked into the forest.  \\n      ﬁLook there,ﬂ said Hagrid, ﬁsee that stuff \\nshinin™ on the ground? Silver\\ny stuff? That™s unicorn \\nblood. There™s a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat. This is the second time in a week. I \\nfound one dead last Wednesday. We™re gonna try an\\n™ find the poor thing. We\\n might have ter put \\nit out of its misery.ﬂ \\n       ﬁAnd what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first?ﬂ said Malfoy, unable to keep the fear out of his voice.        ﬁThere™s nothin™ that lives in the forest that™ll hurt yeh if yer with me or Fang,ﬂ said Hagrid. \\nﬁAn™ keep ter the path. Right, now, we™re gonna \\nsplit inter two parties an™ follow the trail in \\ndiff™rent directions. There™s blood \\nall over the place, it must™ve bi\\nn staggerin™ around since last \\nnight at least.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁI want Fang,ﬂ said Malfoy quickly, looking at Fang™s long teeth.  \\n      ﬁAll right, but I warn yeh, he™s a coward,ﬂ said Hagrid. ﬁSo me, Harry, an™ Hermione™ll go one \\nway an™ Draco, Neville, an™ Fang™ll go the other. Now, if any of us finds the unicorn, we™ll send up green sparks, right? Get yer wands out an™ prac\\ntice now Š that™s it Š an™ if anyone gets in trouble, send up red sparks, an™ we™ll all come\\n an™ find yeh Š so, be careful Š let™s go.ﬂ  \\n      The forest was black and silent. A little way \\ninto it they reached a fork in the earth path, and \\nHarry, Hermione, and Hagrid took the left path while Malfoy, Neville, and Fang took the right. \\n \\n      They walked in silence, their eyes on the ground. Every now and then a ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silver-blue blood on the fallen leaves.       Harry saw that Hagrid looked very worried.  \\n      ﬁCould a werewolf be killing the unicorns?ﬂ Harry asked. \\n \\n      ﬁNot fast enough,ﬂ said Hagrid. ﬁIt™s not easy ter catch a unicorn, they™re powerful magic \\ncreatures. I never knew one ter be hurt before.ﬂ  \\n      They walked past a mossy tree stump. Harry could hear running water; there must be a stream \\nsomewhere close by. There were still spots of\\n unicorn blood here and there along the winding path.   \\n      ﬁYou all right, Hermione?ﬂ Hagrid whispere\\nd. ﬁDon™ worry, it can™t™ve gone far if it™s this badly hurt, an™ then we™ll be able \\nter Š GET BEHIND THAT TREE!ﬂ  \\n      Hagrid seized Harry and Hermione and \\nhoisted them off the path behind a towering oak. He \\npulled out an arrow and fitted it into his crossbow\\n, raising it, ready to fire. The three of them \\nlistened. Something was slithering over dead leav\\nes nearby: it sounded like a cloak trailing along \\nthe ground. Hagrid was squinting up the dark path, but after a few seconds, the sound faded away.  \\n      ﬁI knew it,ﬂ he murmured. ﬁThere™s summat in here that shouldn™ be.ﬂ \\n\\n      \\n  ﬁA werewolf?ﬂ Harry suggested. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁThat wasn™ no werewolf an™ it wasn™ no unicorn, neither,ﬂ said Hagrid grimly. ﬁRight, follow \\nme, but careful, now.ﬂ \\n \\n      They walked more slowly, ears straini\\nng for the faintest sound. Suddenly, in a clearing ahead, something definitely moved. \\n \\n      ﬁWho™s there?ﬂ Hagrid called. ﬁShow yerself Š I™m armed!ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      And into the clearing came Š was it a man, or\\n a horse? To the waist, a man, with red hair and \\nbeard, but below that was a horse™s gleaming ch\\nestnut body with a long, reddish tail. Harry and Hermione™s jaws dropped. \\n \\n      ﬁOh, it™s you, Ronan,ﬂ said Hagrid in relief. ﬁHow are yeh?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      He walked forward and shook the centaur™s hand. \\n \\n      ﬁGood evening to you, Hagrid,ﬂ said Ronan. He had a deep, sorrowful voice. ﬁWere you going to \\nshoot me?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁCan™t be too careful, Ronan,ﬂ said Hagrid, patting his crossbow. ﬁThere™s summat bad loose in \\nthis forest. This is Harry Potter an™ Hermione\\n Granger, by the way. Students up at the school. An™ this is Ronan, you two. He™s a centaur.       ﬁWe™d noticed,ﬂ said Hermione faintly. \\n \\n      ﬁGood evening,ﬂ said Ronan. ﬁStudents, are you? And do you learn much, up at the school?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁErm Šﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁA bit,ﬂ said Hermione timidly. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁA bit. Well, that™s something.ﬂ Ronan \\nsighed. He flung back his head and stared at the sky. ﬁMars is bright tonight.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁYeah,ﬂ said Hagrid, glancing up, too. ﬁListen, I™m glad we™ve run inter yeh, Ronan, ‚cause \\nthere™s a unicorn bin hurt Š you seen anythin™?ﬂ \\n \\n      Ronan didn™t answer immediately. He\\n stared unblinkingly upward, then sighed again. \\n \\n      ﬁAlways the innocent are the first victims,ﬂ he said. ﬁSo it \\nhas been for ages past, so it is now.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁYeah,ﬂ said Hagrid, ﬁbut have yeh seen anythin™ Ronan? Anythin™ unusual?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁMars is bright tonight,ﬂ Ronan repeated, while Hagrid watched him impatiently. ﬁUnusually \\nbright.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁYeah, but I was meanin™ anythin™ unusual \\na bit nearer home,ﬂ said Hagrid. ﬁSo yeh haven™t \\nnoticed anythin™ strange?ﬂ \\n       Yet again, Ronan took a while to answer. At last, he said, ﬁThe forest hides many secrets.ﬂ \\n       A movement in the trees behind Ronan \\nmade Hagrid raise his bow\\n again, but it was only a \\nsecond centaur, black-haired and - bodied and wilder-looking than Ronan.  \\n      ﬁHullo, Bane,ﬂ said Hagrid. ﬁAll right?ﬂ  \\n      ﬁGood evening, Hagrid, I hope you are well?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWell enough. Look, I™ve jus™ bin askin™ Rona\\nn, you seen anythin™ odd in here lately? There™s a \\nunicorn bin injured Š would ye\\nh know anythin™ about it?ﬂ \\n \\n      Bane walked over to stand next to Ronan. He looked skyward. ﬁMars is bright tonight,ﬂ he said simply. \\n \\n      ﬁWe™ve heard,ﬂ said Hagrid grumpily. ﬁW\\nell, if either of you do s\\nee anythin™, let me know, \\nwon™t yeh? We™ll be off, then.ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry and Hermione followed him out of th\\ne clearing, staring over their shoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked their view. \\n      ﬁNever,ﬂ said Hagrid irritably, ﬁtry an™ get a straight answer out of a centaur. Rudd\\ny stargazers. \\nNot interested in anythin™ closer™n the moon.ﬂ \\n       ﬁAre there many of \\nthem\\n in here?ﬂ asked Hermione. \\n \\n      ﬁOh, a fair few– Keep themselves to \\nthemselves mostly, but th\\ney™re good enough about turnin™ up if ever I want a word. They™re deep, mind, \\ncentaurs– they know things– jus™ don™ let on much.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁD™you think that was a centaur we heard earlier?ﬂ said Harry. \\n \\n      ﬁDid that sound like hooves to you? Nah, if \\nyeh ask me, that was what™s bin killin™ the unicorns \\nŒ never heard anythin™ like it before.ﬂ  \\n      They walked on through the dense, dark trees. Harry kept looking nervously over his shoulder. He had the nasty feeling they were being watched. He was very glad they had Hagrid and his crossbow with them. They had just passed a bend \\nin the path when Hermione grabbed Hagrid™s \\narm. \\n \\n      ﬁHagrid! Look! Red sparks, the others are in trouble!ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁYou two wait here!ﬂ Hagrid shouted. ﬁStay on the path, I™ll come back for yeh!ﬂ \\n \\n      They heard him crashing away through the \\nundergrowth and stood looking at each other, very scared, until they couldn™t hear anything but the rustling of leaves around them. \\n       ﬁYou don™t think they™ve been hurt, do you?ﬂ whispered Hermione. \\n \\n      ﬁI don™t care if Malfoy has, but if something™s got Neville– it™\\ns our fault he™s here in the first place.ﬂ  \\n      The minutes dragged by. Their ears seemed sh\\narper than usual. Harry™s seemed to be picking up \\nevery sigh of the wind, every cracking twig. What was going on? Where were the others? \\n \\n      At last, a great crunching noise announced Hagrid™s return. Malfoy, Neville, and Fang were with \\nhim. Hagrid was fuming. Malf\\noy, it seemed, had sneaked up behind Neville and grabbed him as \\na joke. Neville had panicked and sent up the sparks.  \\n      ﬁWe™ll be lucky ter catch anythin™ now, \\nwith the racket you two were makin™. Right, we™re \\nchangin™ groups Š Neville, you stay with me \\nan™ Hermione, Harry, you go with Fang an™ this \\nidiot. I™m sorry,ﬂ Hagrid added in a whisper to Harry, ﬁbut he™ll have a \\nharder time frightenin™ \\nyou, an™ we™ve gotta get this done.ﬂ  \\n      So Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy and Fang. They walked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into the forest, un\\ntil the path became almost impossible to follow \\nbecause the trees were so thick. Harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker. There \\nwere splashes on the roots of a tree, as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by. Harry could see a clearing ahead, through the tangled branches of an ancient oak.        ﬁLook Šﬂ he murmured, holding out his arm to stop Malfoy. \\n\\n \\n      Something bright white was \\ngleaming on the ground. They inched closer. \\n \\n      It was the unicorn all right, and it was dead. Harry had never seen anything so beautiful and sad. Its long, slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread \\npearly-white on the dark leaves. \\n \\n      Harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made \\nhim freeze where he stood. A \\nbush on the edge of the clearing quivered– Then, out of the shadows, a hooded figure came \\ncrawling across the ground like some stalking be\\nast. Harry, Malfoy, and Fang stood transfixed. The cloaked figure reached the unicorn, lowered its head over the wound in the animal™s side, \\nand began to drink its blood.  \\n      ﬁAAAAAAAAAARGH!ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      Malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolte\\nd Š so did Fang. The hooded figure raised its head and looked right at Harry Š unicorn blood was dribbling down its front. It got to its feet and came \\nswiftly toward Harry Š he\\n couldn™t move for fear. \\n \\n      Then a pain like he™d never felt before pierced his head; it was as th\\nough his scar were on fire. Half blinded, he staggered backward. He heard hooves behind him, galloping, and something \\njumped clean over Harry, charging at the figure. \\n \\n      The pain in Harry™s head was so bad he fell to his knees. It took a mi\\nnute or two to pass. When \\nhe looked up, the figure had gone. A centaur was standing over him,\\n not Ronan or Bane; this one looked younger; he had white-blond hair and a palomino body. \\n \\n      ﬁAre you all right?ﬂ said the centaur, pulling Harry to his feet.  \\n      ﬁYes Š thank you Š what was that?ﬂ  \\n      The centaur didn™t answer. He had astonishingly blue eyes, like pale sapphires. He looked carefully at Harry, his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out, livid, on Harry™s forehead.  \\n      ﬁYou are the Potter boy,ﬂ he said. ﬁYou had better get back to Hagrid. The forest is not safe at this time Š especially for you. Can you ride? It will be quicker this way. \\n \\n      ﬁMy name is Firenze,ﬂ he added, as he lowe\\nred himself on to his front \\nlegs so that Harry could clamber onto his back. \\n \\n      There was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing. Ronan and \\nBane came bursting through the trees,\\n their flanks heaving and sweaty.       ﬁFirenze!ﬂ Bane thundered. ﬁWhat are you doing? You have a human on your back! Have you \\nno shame? Are you a common mule?ﬂ \\n       ﬁDo you realize who this is?ﬂ said Firenze.\\n ﬁThis is the Potter boy. The quicker he leaves this \\nforest, the better.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWhat have you been telling him?ﬂ growled \\nBane. ﬁRemember, Firenze, we are sworn not to set \\nourselves against the heavens. Have we not read what is to come in the movements of the \\n\\nplanets?ﬂ \\n \\n      Ronan pawed the ground nervously. ﬁI™m sure Firenze thought he was acting for the best,ﬂ he \\nsaid in his gloomy voice. \\n \\n      Bane kicked his back legs in anger. \\n \\n      ﬁFor the best! What is th\\nat to do with us? Centaurs\\n are concerned with what has been foretold! It \\nis not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest!ﬂ \\n \\n      Firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, so that Harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on.  \\n      ﬁDo you not see that unicorn?ﬂ Firenze bellowed at Bane. ﬁDo you not understand why it was \\nkilled? Or have the planets not le\\nt you in on that secret? I set myse\\nlf against what is lurking in \\nthis forest, Bane, yes, with humans alongside me if I must.ﬂ \\n \\n      And Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on as best he could, they plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane behind them. \\n \\n      Harry didn™t have a clue what was going on. \\n \\n      ﬁWhy™s Bane so angry?ﬂ he asked. ﬁW\\nhat was that thing you saved me from, anyway?ﬂ \\n \\n      Firenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep his head bowed in case of low-hanging branches, but did not answer Harry™s question. They made their wa\\ny through the trees in silence for so long that Harry thought Firenze didn™t want to talk to him anymore. They were passing \\nthrough a particularly dense patch of trees, however, when Firenze suddenly stopped.  \\n      ﬁHarry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used for?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁNo,ﬂ said Harry, startled by the odd question. ﬁWe™ve only used the \\nhorn and tail hair in Potions.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁThat is because it is a monstrous thing, to\\n slay a unicorn,ﬂ said Fi\\nrenze. ﬁOnly one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a crime. The blood of a unicorn will \\n\\nkeep you alive, even if you are an inch from \\ndeath, but at a terrible price. You have slain something pure and defenseless to \\nsave yourself, and you will have but a half-life, a cursed life, from the moment the blood touches your lips.ﬂ \\n       Harry stared at the back of Firenze™s head, which was dappled silver in the moonlight. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁBut who™d be that desperate?ﬂ he w\\nondered aloud. ﬁIf you™re going to be cursed forever, death™s better, isn™t it?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁIt is,ﬂ Firenze agreed, ﬁunless all you need \\nis to stay alive long enough to drink something else \\nŠ something that will bring you back to full st\\nrength and power Š something that will mean \\nyou can never die. Mr. Potter, do you know what is\\n hidden in the school at this very moment?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁThe Sorcerer™s Stone! Of course Š the Elixir of Life! But \\nI don™t understand who Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁCan you think of nobody who has waited many y\\nears to return to power, who has clung to life, awaiting their chance?ﬂ \\n \\n      It was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around Harry™s heart. Over the rustling of the trees, he seemed to hear once more what Hagrid\\n had told him on the night they had met: ﬁSome \\nsay he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if \\nhe had enough human left in him to die.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁDo you mean,ﬂ Harry croaked, ﬁthat was \\nVol- ﬂ        ﬁHarry! Harry, are you all right?ﬂ  \\n      Hermione was running toward them\\n down the path, Hagrid puffing along behind her. \\n       ﬁI™m fine,ﬂ said Harry, hardly knowing what he was saying. ﬁThe unicorn\\n™s dead, Hagrid, it™s in that clearing back there.ﬂ \\n       ﬁThis is where I leave you,ﬂ Firenze murmur\\ned as Hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn. \\nﬁYou are safe now.ﬂ  \\n      Harry slid off his back. \\n \\n      ﬁGood luck, Harry Potter,ﬂ said Firenze. ﬁT\\nhe planets have been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope this is one of those times.ﬂ \\n \\n      He turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest, leaving Harry shivering behind him. \\n\\n \\n  Ron had fallen asleep in th\\ne dark common room, waiting for them to return. He shouted \\nsomething about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook him awake. In a matter of seconds, \\n\\nthough, he was wide-eyed as Harry began to tell him and Hermione what had happened in the \\nforest. \\n \\n      Harry couldn™t sit down. He paced up and \\ndown in front of the fire. He was still shaking.        ﬁSnape wants the stone for Voldemort– \\nand Voldemort™s waiting in the forest– and all this \\ntime we thought Snape just wanted to get rich–ﬂ \\n       ﬁStop saying the name!ﬂ said Ron in a terrified whisper, as \\nif he thought Voldemort could hear them. \\n \\n      Harry wasn™t listening. \\n \\n      ﬁFirenze saved me, but he shouldn™t have\\n done so– Bane was furious– he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happen– They must show that Voldemort™s \\ncoming back– Bane thinks Firenze should have \\nlet Voldemort kill me– I suppose that™s written \\nin the stars as well.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWill you stop saying the name!ﬂ \\nRon hissed.  \\n      ﬁSo all I™ve got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone,ﬂ Harry went on feverishly, ﬁthen \\nVoldemort will be able to come and finish me off– Well, I suppose Bane™ll be happy.ﬂ \\n \\n      Hermione looked very fright\\nened, but she had a word of comfort.  \\n      ﬁHarry, everyone says Dumbledore™s the only one You-Know\\n-Who was ever afraid of, with \\nDumbledore around, You-Know-Who won™t touc\\nh you. Anyway, who says the centaurs are right? It sounds like fortune-telling to me, a\\nnd Professor McGonagall says that™s a very imprecise branch of magic.ﬂ \\n \\n      The sky had turned light before they stopped talking. They went to bed exhausted, their throats sore. But the night™s surprises weren™t over. \\n \\n      When Harry pulled back his sheets, he f\\nound his invisibility cloak folded neatly underneath them. There was a note pinned to it: \\n  Just in case. \\n           \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n CHAPTER SIXTEEN \\n  Through the Trapdoor  \\n  In years to come, Harry would never quite \\nremember how he had managed to get through his \\nexams when he half expected Voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment. Yet \\n\\nthe days crept by, and there could be no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and well behind the \\nlocked door.  \\n      It was sweltering hot, especially in the large classroom where they did their written papers. They \\nhad been given special, new quills for the exams, which had been bewitched with an \\n\\nAnticheating spell. \\n \\n      They had practical exams as well. Professo\\nr Flitwick called them one by \\none into his class to see \\nif they could make a pineappl\\ne tapdance across a desk. Professor McGonagall watched them turn \\na mouse into a snuffbox Š points were given for how\\n pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers. Snape made them all nervous, br\\neathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion. \\n \\n      Harry did the best he could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his forehead, which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest. Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam \\nnerves because Harry couldn™t sleep, but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by his old \\nnightmare, except that it was now worse than \\never because there was a hooded figure dripping \\nblood in it.        Maybe it was because they hadn™t seen what Harry had seen in the forest, or because they didn™t \\nhave scars burning on their foreheads, but Ron and Hermione didn™t seem as worried about the \\nStone as Harry. The idea of Voldemort certainly scar\\ned them, but he didn™t keep visiting them in \\ndreams, and they were so busy with their studying \\nthey didn™t have much time to fret about what \\nSnape or anyone else might be up to. \\n       Their very last exam was History of Ma\\ngic. One hour of answering questions about batty old wizards who™d invented selfstirring cauldrons and they™d be free, free for a whole wonderful \\nweek until their exam results came out. When th\\ne ghost of Professor Binns told them to put down \\n\\ntheir quills and roll up their parchment, Harry couldn™t help cheering with the rest. \\n \\n      ﬁThat was far easier than I thought it would be,ﬂ said Hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds. ﬁI needn™t have learned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of \\nConduct or the uprising of Elfric the Eager.ﬂ  \\n      Hermione always liked to go through their \\nexam papers afterward, but \\nRon said this made him \\nfeel ill, so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under a tree. The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were tickling the tentacle\\ns of a giant squid, which was basking in the warm shallows. ﬁNo \\nmore studying,ﬂ Ron sighed happily, stretching out on the grass. ﬁYou could look more cheerful, \\nHarry, we™ve got a week before we find out how badly we™ve done, there™s no need to worry yet.ﬂ        Harry was rubbing his forehead. \\n \\n      ﬁI wish I knew what this means!ﬂ he burst out angrily. ﬁMy scar keeps hurting Š it™s happened before, but never as often as this.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁGo to Madam Pomfrey,ﬂ Hermione suggested. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁI™m not ill,ﬂ said Harry. ﬁI th\\nink it™s a warning– it means danger™s coming–ﬂ \\n \\n      Ron couldn™t get worked up, it was too hot. \\n \\n      ﬁHarry, relax, Hermione™s right, the St\\none™s safe as long as Dumbledore™s around. Anyway, \\nwe™ve never had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy. He nearly had his leg ripped off once, he™s not going to try it again in a hu\\nrry. And Neville will play Quidditch for England \\n\\nbefore Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry nodded, but he couldn™t shake off a lurking feeling that there was something he™d \\nforgotten to do, something important. When he trie\\nd to explain this, Hermi\\none said, ﬁThat™s just the exams. I woke up last night and was half\\nway through my Transfiguration notes before I \\nremembered we™d done that one.ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn™t have anything to do with work, though. He watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky, a note clamped in its mouth. \\nHagrid was the only one who ever sent him le\\ntters. Hagrid would never betray Dumbledore. \\nHagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy– never– but–  \\n       \\n Harry suddenly jumped to his feet. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁWhere™re you goi\\nng?ﬂ said Ron sleepily. \\n \\n      ﬁI™ve just thought of something,ﬂ said \\nHarry. He had turned white. ﬁWe™ve got to go and see Hagrid, now.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁWhy?ﬂ panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁDon™t you think it™s a bit odd,ﬂ said Harry, scrambling up the grassy \\nslope, ﬁthat what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon, and \\na stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket? How many people wander around w\\nith dragon eggs if it™s against wizard law? \\nLucky they found Hagrid, don™t you think? Why didn™t I see it before?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWhat are you talking about?ﬂ said Ron, \\nbut Harry, sprinting across the grounds toward the forest, didn™t answer.  \\n      Hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside\\n his house; his trousers and sleeves were rolled up, and he was shelling peas into a large bowl.        ﬁHullo,ﬂ he said, smiling. ﬁFin\\nished yer exams? Got time fer a drink?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁYes, please,ﬂ said Ron, but Harry cut him off. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁNo, we™re in a hurry. Hagrid, I™ve got to ask you something. You know that night you won \\nNorbert? What did the stranger you we\\nre playing cards with look like?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁDunno,ﬂ said Hagrid casually, ﬁhe wouldn™ take his cloak off.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      He saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁIt™s not that unusual, yeh get a lot o™ funny folk in the Hog™s Head Š that™s one of the pub down in the village. Mighta bin a dragon dealer, mightn™ he? I never saw his face, he kept his \\nhood up.ﬂ  \\n      Harry sank down next to the bowl of peas. ﬁWhat did you talk to him about, Hagrid? Did you \\nmention Hogwarts at all?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁMighta come up,ﬂ said Hagrid, frowning as\\n he tried to remember. ﬁY\\neah– he asked what I did, an™ I told him I was gamekeeper here– He asked \\na bit about the sorta creatures I took after– so I told him– an™ I said what I™d always r\\neally wanted was a dragon– an™ then– I can™ remember too well, ‚cause he kept buyin™ me dr\\ninks– Let™s see– yeah, then he said he had the dragon egg an™ we could play cards fer it if I wanted– but he had ter be sure I could handle it, he didn™ want it ter go ter any old home– So I told him, after Fluffy, a dragon would be easy–ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁAnd did he Š did he seem interested in \\nFluffy?ﬂ Harry asked, trying to keep his voice calm. \\n \\n      ﬁWell Š yeah Š how many three-headed \\ndogs d™yeh meet, even ar\\nound Hogwarts? So I told \\nhim, Fluffy™s a piece o™ cake \\nif yeh know how to calm him down, jus™ play him a bit o™ music \\nan™ he™ll go straight off ter sleep Šﬂ  \\n      Hagrid suddenly looked horrified. \\n \\n      ﬁI shouldn™ta told yeh that!ﬂ he blurted out. ﬁForget I said it! Hey Š where™re yeh goin™?ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry, Ron, and Hermione didn™t speak to \\neach other at all until they came to a halt in the \\nentrance hall, which seemed very \\ncold and gloomy after the grounds.  \\n      ﬁWe™ve got to go to Dumbledore,ﬂ said Harr\\ny. ﬁHagrid told that stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that\\n cloak Š it must™ve been easy, once he™d got Hagrid drunk. I just hope Dumbledore believes us. \\nFirenze might back us up if Bane doesn™t stop \\nhim. Where™s Dumbledore™s office?ﬂ \\n \\n      They looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right direction. They had never been told where Dumbledore lived, nor di\\nd they know anyone who had been sent to see him. \\n       ﬁWe™ll just have to Šﬂ Harry be\\ngan, but a voice suddenly rang across the hall.  \\n      ﬁWhat are you three doing inside?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      It was Professor McGonagall, carrying a larg\\ne pile of books.  \\n      ﬁWe want to see Professor Dumbledore,ﬂ \\nsaid Hermione, rather bravely, Harry and Ron thought. \\n \\n      ﬁSee Professor Dumbledore?ﬂ Professor McGonagall repeated, as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do. ﬁWhy?ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry swallowed Š now what? \\n\\n \\n      ﬁIt™s sort of secret,ﬂ he said, but he wished at once he hadn™t, because Professor McGonagall™s nostrils flared.  \\n      ﬁProfessor Dumbledore left\\n ten minutes ago,ﬂ she said coldl\\ny. ﬁHe received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for London at once.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁHe™s gone?ﬂ said Harry frantically. ﬁNow?ﬂ  \\n      ﬁProfessor Dumbledore is a very great \\nwizard, Potter, he has many demands on his time Œ ﬂ \\n       ﬁBut this is important.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁSomething you have to say is more im\\nportant than the Ministry of Magic, Potter?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁLook,ﬂ said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, ﬁProfessor Š it™s a\\nbout the Sorcerer™s Stone Šﬂ  \\n      Whatever Professor McGonagall had e\\nxpected, it wasn™t that. The books she was carrying tumbled out of her arms, but she didn™t pick them up. \\n \\n      ﬁHow do you know Š?ﬂ she spluttered. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁProfessor, I think Š I know Š that SnŠ that someone™s going \\nto try and steal the Stone. I™ve got to talk to Professor Dumbledore.ﬂ \\n \\n      She eyed him with a \\nmixture of shock and suspicion. \\n \\n      ﬁProfessor Dumbledore will be back tomo\\nrrow,ﬂ she said finally. ﬁI don™t know how you found out about the Stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly steal it, it™s too well protected.ﬂ        ﬁBut Professor Šﬂ       ﬁPotter, I know what I™m talking about,ﬂ \\nshe said shortly. She bent down and gathered up the fallen books. ﬁI suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the sunshine.ﬂ        \\n But they didn™t. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁIt™s tonight,ﬂ said Harry, once he was sure Professor McGonagall was \\nout of earshot. ﬁSnape™s going through the trapdoor tonight. He™s found out everything he needs, and now he™s got Dumbledore out of the way. He sent that note, I \\nbet the Ministry of Magic will get a real shock \\n\\nwhen Dumbledore turns up.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁBut what can we Šﬂ \\n \\n      Hermione gasped. Harry and Ron wheeled round. \\n\\n \\n      Snape was standing there. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁGood afternoon,ﬂ he said smoothly. \\n\\n \\n      They stared at him. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁYou shouldn™t be inside on a day like this,ﬂ he said, with an odd, twisted smile. \\n \\n      ﬁWe were Šﬂ Harry began, w\\nithout any idea what he was going to say.  \\n      ﬁYou want to be more careful,ﬂ said Sn\\nape. ﬁHanging around like this, people will think you™re up to something. And Gryffindor really can™t a\\nfford to lose any more points, can it?ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry flushed. They turned to go outside, but Snape called them back. \\n       ﬁBe warned, Potter Š any more nighttime\\n wanderings and I will personally make sure you are \\nexpelled. Good day to you.ﬂ  \\n      He strode off in the direction of the staffroom. \\n \\n      Out on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others. \\n \\n      ﬁRight, here™s what we™ve got to do,ﬂ he whispered urgently. ﬁOne of us has got to keep an eye on Snape Š wait outside the staff room and follow him if he leaves it. Hermione, you™d better do \\nthat.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁWhy me?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁIt™s obvious,ﬂ said Ron. ﬁYou can prete\\nnd to be waiting for Professor Flitwick, you know.ﬂ He \\nput on a high voice, ﬁ‚Oh Professor Flitwick, I™\\nm so worried, I think I got question fourteen \\nb wrong– ™ﬂ        ﬁOh, shut up,ﬂ said Hermione, but she agreed to go and watch out for Snape. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁAnd we™d better stay outside the third-floor corridor,ﬂ Harry told Ron. ﬁCome on.ﬂ \\n \\n      But that part of the plan didn™t work. No\\n sooner had they reached the door separating Fluffy from \\nthe rest of the school than Professor McGonagall turned up again and this time, she lost her \\ntemper. \\n \\n      ﬁI suppose you think you™re harder to get past than a pack of enchantments!ﬂ she stormed. \\nﬁEnough of this nonsense! If I hear you™ve come anywhere near here\\n again, I™ll take another fifty points from Gryffindor! Yes, \\nWeasley, from my own house!ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry and Ron went back to the common \\nroom, Harry had just said, ﬁAt least Hermione™s on \\nSnape™s tail,ﬂ when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came in. \\n \\n      ﬁI™m sorry, Harry!ﬂ she wailed. ﬁSnape came out and asked me what I was doing, so I said I was \\nwaiting for Flitwick, and Snape went to get him, \\nand I™ve only just got away, I don™t know where \\nSnape went.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁWell, that™s it \\nthen, isn™t it?ﬂ Harry said. \\n \\n      The other two stared at him. He\\n was pale and his eyes were glittering. \\n \\n      ﬁI™m going out of here tonight and \\nI™m going to try and get \\nto the Stone first.ﬂ \\n       ﬁYou™re mad!ﬂ said Ron. \\n \\n      ﬁYou can™t!ﬂ said Hermione. ﬁAfter \\nwhat McGonagall and Snape have said? You™ll be \\nexpelled!ﬂ  \\n      ﬁSO WHATﬂ Harry shouted. ﬁDon™t you under\\nstand? If Snape gets hold of the Stone, Voldemort™s coming back! Haven™t you heard what \\nit was like when he was trying to take over? \\nThere won™t be any Hogwarts to get expelled from! \\nHe™ll flatten it, or turn it into a school for the Dark Arts! Losing points doesn™t matter anymore,\\n can™t you see? D™you think he™ll leave you and \\nyour families alone if Gryffindor wins the house c\\nup? If I get caught before I can get to the \\nStone, well, I™ll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there, it™s \\nonly dying a bit later than I would have, because I™m never going over to the Dark Side! I™m \\ngoing through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me! Voldemort \\nkilled my parents, remember?ﬂ \\n \\n      He glared at them. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁYou™re right Harry,ﬂ said Hermione in a small voice. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁI™ll use the invisibility cloak,ﬂ said Harry. ﬁIt™s just lucky I got it back.ﬂ        ﬁBut will it cover all three of us?ﬂ said Ron. \\n \\n      ﬁAll Š all three of us?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁOh, come off it, you don™t think we™d let you go alone?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁOf course not,ﬂ said Hermione briskly. ﬁHow do you think you™d get to the Stone without us?         I™d better go and look through my books\\n, there might be something useful–ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁBut if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁNot if I can help it,ﬂ said Hermione grim\\nly. ﬁFlitwick told me in secret that I got a hundred and \\ntwelve percent on his exam. They™re not throwing me out after that.ﬂ \\n \\n  After dinner the three of them sat nervously\\n apart in the common room. Nobody bothered them; \\nnone of the Gryffindors had anything to say to Harry\\n any more, after all. This was the first night \\nhe hadn™t been upset by it. Hermione was skimming through all her notes, hoping to come across \\n\\none of the enchantments they were about to tr\\ny to break. Harry and Ron didn™t talk much. Both of them were thinking about what they were about to do. \\n \\n      Slowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁBetter get the cloak,ﬂ Ron muttered, as Le\\ne Jordan finally left, stretching and yawning. Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory. He pulled ou\\nt the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had given him for Christma\\ns. He pocketed it to use on Fluffy Š he didn™t feel much like \\nsinging.  \\n      He ran back down to the common room. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁWe™d better put the cloak on here, and make sure\\n it covers all three of us Œ if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁWhat are you doing?ﬂ said a voice from the \\ncorner of the room. Nevi\\nlle appeared from behind \\nan armchair, clutching Trevor the toad, who l\\nooked as though he™d been making another bid for \\nfreedom. \\n \\n      ﬁNothing, Neville, nothing,ﬂ said Ha\\nrry, hurriedly putting the cloak behind his back. \\n \\n      Neville stared at their guilty faces. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁYou™re going out again,ﬂ he said. \\n \\n      ﬁNo, no, no,ﬂ said Hermione. ﬁNo, \\nwe™re not. Why don™t you go to bed, Neville?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      Harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door. They couldn™t afford to waste any more time, \\nSnape might even now be playing Fluffy to sleep. \\n      ﬁYou can™t go out,ﬂ said Neville, ﬁyou™ll \\nbe caught again. Gryffindor will be in even more \\ntrouble.ﬂ        ﬁYou don™t understand,ﬂ said Harry, ﬁthis is important.ﬂ  \\n      But Neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate. \\n \\n      ﬁI won™t let you do it,ﬂ he said, hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole. ﬁI™ll Š I™ll fight you!ﬂ  \\n      ﬁNeville, ﬁRon exploded, ﬁget away from that hole and don™t be an idiot Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁDon™t you call me an idiot!ﬂ said Neville\\n. ﬁI don™t think you should be \\nbreaking any more rules! \\nAnd you were the one who told me to stand up to people!ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁYes, but not to us,ﬂ said Ron in exasperation. ﬁNeville, you don™t know what you™re doing.ﬂ  \\n      He took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the toad, who leapt out of sight. \\n \\n      ﬁGo on then, try and hit me!ﬂ said\\n Neville, raising his fists. ﬁI™m ready!ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry turned to Hermione. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁDo something,ﬂ he said desperately.        Hermione stepped forward. \\n \\n      ﬁNeville,ﬂ she said, ﬁI™m \\nreally, really sorry about this.ﬂ  \\n      She raised her wand. \\n \\n      ﬁPetrificus Totalus!\\nﬂ she cried, pointing it at Neville. \\n \\n      Neville™s arms snapped to his sides. His legs sprang together. His whole body rigid, he swayed \\nwhere he stood and then fell flat on his face, stiff as a board. \\n \\n      Hermione ran to turn him over. Neville™s \\njaws were jammed together so he couldn™t speak. Only his eyes were moving, looking at them in horror. \\n \\n      ﬁWhat™ve you done to him?ﬂ Harry whispered. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁIt™s the full Body-Bind,ﬂ said Hermione miserably. ﬁOh, Neville, I™m so sorry.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWe had to, Neville, \\nno time to explain,ﬂ said Harry. \\n       ﬁYou™ll understand later, Neville,ﬂ said Ron as they stepped over him and pulled on the invisibility cloak.        But leaving Neville lying motionless on th\\ne floor didn™t feel like a very good omen. In their \\nnervous state, every statue™s shadow looked like\\n Filch, every distant breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping down on them. At the foot of the \\nfirst set of stairs, they spotted Mrs. Norris skulking near the top.  \\n      ﬁOh, let™s kick her, just this once,ﬂ Ron whispered in Harry™s ear, but Harry shook his head. As \\nthey climbed carefully around her, Mrs. Norris \\nturned her lamplike eyes on them, but didn™t do \\nanything.  \\n      They didn™t meet anyone else until they \\nreached the staircase up to the third floor. Peeves was \\nbobbing halfway up, loosening the carp\\net so that people would trip.  \\n      ﬁWho™s there?ﬂ he said suddenly as they \\nclimbed toward him. He narrowed his wicked black \\neyes. ﬁKnow you™re there, even if I can™t see you. Are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?ﬂ  \\n      He rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at them. \\n \\n      ﬁShould call Filch, I should, if\\n something™s a-creeping around unseen.ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry had a sudden idea. \\n \\n      ﬁPeeves,ﬂ he said, in a hoarse whisper, ﬁthe Bloody Baron has his own reasons for being invisible.ﬂ \\n \\n      Peeves almost fell out of the air in shoc\\nk. He caught himself in time \\nand hovered about a foot off the stairs.  \\n      ﬁSo sorry, your bloodiness, Mr. Baron, Sir,ﬂ he said greasily. ﬁMy mistake, my mistake Š I \\ndidn™t see you Š of course I didn™t, you™re invisible Š forgive old Peevsie his little joke, sir.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁI have business here, Peeves,ﬂ croaked Harry. ﬁStay away from this place tonight.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁI will, sir, I most certainly will,ﬂ said\\n Peeves, rising up in the air again. ﬁHope your business \\ngoes well, Baron, I™ll not bother you.ﬂ \\n \\n      And he scooted off. \\n \\n      ﬁBrilliant\\n, Harry!ﬂ whispered Ron.  \\n      A few seconds later, they \\nwere there, outside the third-floor corridor Š and the door was already ajar.        ﬁWell, there you are,ﬂ Harry said quietly, ﬁSnape™s alrea\\ndy got past Fluffy.ﬂ       Seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them\\n what was facing them. Underneath the cloak, Harry turned to the other two.        ﬁIf you want to go back, I won™t blame you,ﬂ \\nhe said. ﬁYou can take th\\ne cloak, I won™t need it now.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁDon™t be stupid,ﬂ said Ron. \\n \\n      ﬁWe™re coming,ﬂ said Hermione. \\n\\n \\n      Harry pushed the door open. \\n \\n      As the door creaked, low, rumbling growls\\n met their ears. All three of the dog™s noses sniffed madly in their direction, even\\n though it couldn™t see them. \\n \\n      ﬁWhat™s that at its feet?ﬂ Hermione whispered. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁLooks like a harp,ﬂ said Ron. ﬁSnape must have left it there.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁIt must wake up the moment you st\\nop playing,ﬂ said Harry. ﬁWell, here goes–ﬂ \\n \\n      He put Hagrid™s flute to his lips and blew. It wasn™t really a tune, but from the first note the \\nbeast™s eyes began to droop. Harry hardly drew breath. Slowly, the dog™s growls ceased Š it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees, then it slumpe\\nd to the ground, fast asleep.        ﬁKeep playing,ﬂ Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor. They could feel the dog™s hot, smelly \\nbreath as they approached the giant heads. ﬁI think we™ll be able to pull the \\ndoor open,ﬂ said Ron, peering over the dog™s back. ﬁWant to go \\nfirst, Hermione?ﬂ \\n       ﬁNo, I don™t!ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁAll right.ﬂ Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog™s legs. He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and open.  \\n      ﬁWhat can you see?ﬂ Hermione said anxiously. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁNothing Š just black Š there™s no way of climbing down, we™ll just have to drop.ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Ron to get his attention and pointed at himself. \\n \\n      ﬁYou want to go first? Are you sure?ﬂ said\\n Ron. ﬁI don™t know how deep this thing goes. Give \\nthe flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep.ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry handed the flute over. In the few seconds™ silence, the dog growled and twitched, but the moment Hermione began to play, \\nit fell back into its deep sleep. \\n      Harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor. There was no sign of the bottom. \\n       He lowered himself through the hole until \\nhe was hanging on by his fingertips. Then he looked up at Ron and said, ﬁIf anything happens to me, don™\\nt follow. Go straight to the owlery and send \\nHedwig to Dumbledore, right?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁRight,ﬂ said Ron. \\n \\n      ﬁSee you in a minute, I hope–ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      And Harry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past him as he fell down, down, down and Š \\n\\n \\n      FLUMP. With a funny, muffled sort of t\\nhump he landed on something soft. He sat up and felt \\naround, his eyes not used to the gloom. It felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant. \\n \\n      ﬁIt™s okay!ﬂ he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, which was the open trapdoor, \\nﬁit™s a soft landing, you can jump!ﬂ \\n \\n      Ron followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to Harry. \\n \\n      ﬁWhat™s this stuff?ﬂ were his first words. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁDunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppos\\ne it™s here to break the fall. Come on, Hermione!ﬂ \\n \\n      The distant music stopped. There was a l\\noud bark from the dog, but Hermione had already \\njumped. She landed on Harry™s other side. \\n \\n      ﬁWe must be miles \\nunder the school,ﬂ she said.  \\n      ﬁLucky this plant thing™s here, really,ﬂ said Ron. \\n \\n      ﬁLucky!ﬂ shrieked Hermione. ﬁLook at you both!ﬂ \\n \\n      She leapt up and struggled toward a damp \\nwall. She had to struggle because the moment she had \\nlanded, the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing.  \\n      Hermione had managed to free herself before\\n the plant got a firm grip on her. Now she watched \\nin horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them, but the more they strained against it, \\nthe tighter and faster the plant wound around them.  \\n      ﬁStop moving!ﬂ Hermione ordered them. \\nﬁI know what this is Š it™s Devil™s Snare!ﬂ  \\n      ﬁOh, I™m so glad we know what it™s called, that™s a great help,ﬂ snarled Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck. ﬁS\\nhut up, I™m trying to remember how to kill it!ﬂ \\nsaid Hermione. \\n      ﬁWell, hurry up, I can™t breathe!ﬂ Harry gasp\\ned, wrestling with it as it curled around his chest.        ﬁDevil™s Snare, Devil™s Snare– what did \\nProfessor Sprout say? Š it likes the dark and the \\ndamp.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁSo light a fire!ﬂ Harry choked. \\n \\n      ﬁYes Š of course Š but there™s no wood!ﬂ Hermione cried, wringing her hands. \\n \\n      ﬁHAVE YOU GONE MAD?ﬂ Ron be\\nllowed. ﬁARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁOh, right!ﬂ said Hermione, and she whi\\npped out her wand, waved it, muttered something, and \\nsent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had us\\ned on Snape at the plant. In a matter of seconds, \\nthe two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth. Wriggling \\nand flailing, it unraveled itself from their bod\\nies, and they were able to pull free.  \\n      ﬁLucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermi\\none,ﬂ said Harry as he joined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face.  \\n      ﬁYeah,ﬂ said Ron, ﬁand lucky Harry doesn™t lose his head in a crisis Š ‚there™s no wood,™ honestly.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁThis way,ﬂ said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was the only way forward. \\n \\n      All they could hear apart from their foot\\nsteps was the gentle drip of water trickling down the \\nwalls. The passageway sloped downward, and Harry was reminded of Gringotts. With an \\nunpleasant jolt of the heart, he remembered the dragons said to be \\nguarding vaults in the wizards™ bank. If they met a dragon, a fully-grown\\n dragon Š Norbert had been bad enough–         \\n ﬁCan you hear something?ﬂ Ron whispered. \\n\\n \\n      Harry listened. A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up ahead. \\n \\n      ﬁDo you think it™s a ghost?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁI don™t know– sounds like wings to me.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁThere™s light ahead Š I can see something moving.ﬂ \\n \\n      They reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling \\narching high above them. It was full of small, \\njewel-bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all \\naround the room. On the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door. \\n \\n      ﬁDo you think they™ll attack us if we cross the room?ﬂ said Ron. \\n       ﬁProbably,ﬂ said Harry. ﬁThey don™t look very vicious, but I suppose if they all swooped down at once– well, there™s no other choice– I™ll run.ﬂ        He took a deep breath, covered his face with\\n his arms, and sprinted across the room. He expected \\nto feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second, but no\\nthing happened. He reached the door untouched. He pulled the handle, but it was locked.  \\n      The other two followed him. They tugge\\nd and heaved at the door, but it wouldn™t budge, not even when Hermione tried her Alohomora charm. \\n \\n      ﬁNow what?ﬂ said Ron. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁThese birds– they can™t be here just for decoration,ﬂ said Hermione. \\n \\n      They watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering Šglittering?  \\n      ﬁThey™re not birds!ﬂ Harry said suddenly. ﬁThey™re \\nkeys! Winged keys Š look carefully. So that \\nmust mean–ﬂ he looked around the chamber while \\nthe other two squinted up at the flock of keys. ﬁ– yes Š look! Broomsticks! We™ve \\ngot to catch the key to the door!ﬂ  \\n      ﬁBut there are hundreds of them!ﬂ \\n \\n      Ron examined the lock on the door. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁWe™re looking for a big, old-fashi\\noned one Š probably silver, like the handle.ﬂ        They each seized a broomstick and kicked o\\nff into the air, soaring into the midst of the cloud of \\nkeys. They grabbed and snatched, but the bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one. \\n       Not for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century. He had a knack for spotting things other people didn™t. After a minute™s weav\\ning about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole.  \\n      ﬁThat one!ﬂ he called to the others. ﬁThat big one Š there Š no, there Š with bright blue wings Š the feathers are all crumpled on one side.ﬂ \\n \\n      Ron went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing, crashed into the ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom. \\n \\n      ﬁWe™ve got to close in on it!ﬂ Harry ca\\nlled, not taking his eyes off the key with the damaged \\nwing. ﬁRon, you come at it from above Š Hermione, stay below and stop it from going down \\n\\nand I™ll try and catch it. Right, NOW!ﬂ  \\n      Ron dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the \\nkey dodged them both, and Harry streaked after it; it \\nsped toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and with a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone with one hand. Ron and Hermione™s cheers echoed around the high chamber. \\n       They landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in his hand. He rammed it \\ninto the lock and turned Œ it worked. The moment the lock had c\\nlicked open, the key took flight again, looking very battered now that it had been caught twice.  \\n      ﬁReady?ﬂ Harry asked the other two, his hand on the door handle. They nodded. He pulled the door open.  \\n      The next chamber was so dark they couldn™t s\\nee anything at all. But as th\\ney stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight.  \\n      They were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black chessmen, which were \\nall taller than they were a\\nnd carved from what looked like bl\\nack stone. Facing them, way across \\nthe chamber, were the white pieces. Harry, Ron a\\nnd Hermione shivered slightly Œ the towering \\nwhite chessmen had no faces. \\n \\n      ﬁNow what do we do?ﬂ Harry whispered. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁIt™s obvious, isn™t it?ﬂ said Ron. ﬁWe™ve got to \\nplay our way across the room.ﬂ \\n \\n      Behind the white pieces they could see another door. \\n \\n      ﬁHow?ﬂ said Hermione nervously. \\n\\n       ﬁI think,ﬂ said Ron, ﬁwe™re going to have to be chessmen.ﬂ \\n       He walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knight™s horse. At once, the stone sprang to life. The horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look \\ndown at Ron.  \\n      ﬁDo we Š er Š have to join you to get across?ﬂ The black knight nodded. Ron turned to the other two.  \\n      ﬁThis needs thinking about–ﬂ he said. ﬁI suppose we™ve got to take the place of three of the black pieces–ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry and Hermione stay\\ned quiet, watching Ron think. Finally\\n he said, ﬁNow, don™t be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at chess Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁWe™re not offended,ﬂ said Ha\\nrry quickly. ﬁJust tell us what to do.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWell, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, you go there instead of that \\ncastle.ﬂ        ﬁWhat about you?ﬂ \\n      ﬁI™m going to be a knight,ﬂ said Ron. \\n\\n \\n      The chessmen seemed to have been liste\\nning, because at these words a knight, a bishop, and a \\ncastle turned their backs on the white pieces a\\nnd walked off the board, leaving three empty \\nsquares that Harry, Ron, and Hermione took. \\n \\n      ﬁWhite always plays first in chess,\\nﬂ said Ron, peering across the board. ﬁYes– look–ﬂ  \\n      A white pawn had moved forward two squares. \\n \\n      Ron started to direct the black pieces. They moved silently wherever he sent them. Harry™s knees were trembling. What if they lost? \\n \\n      ﬁHarry Š move diagona\\nlly four squares to the right.ﬂ  \\n      Their first real shock came when their ot\\nher knight was taken. The white queen smashed him to \\nthe floor and dragged him off the board, where he lay quite still, facedown. \\n \\n      ﬁHad to let that happen,ﬂ said Ron, looking shaken. ﬁLeaves you free to take that bishop, Hermione, go on.ﬂ \\n \\n      Every time one of their men was lost, \\nthe white pieces showed no mercy. Soon there was a \\nhuddle of limp black players slumped along the wall.\\n Twice, Ron only just noticed in time that \\nHarry and Hermione were in danger. He himsel\\nf darted around the board, taking almost as many \\nwhite pieces as they \\nhad lost black ones.  \\n      ﬁWe™re nearly there,ﬂ he muttere\\nd suddenly. ﬁLet me think Š let me think–ﬂ \\n \\n      The white queen turned her blank face toward him. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁYes–ﬂ said Ron softly, ﬁIt™s the only way– I™ve got to be taken.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁNO!ﬂ Harry and Hermione shouted. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁThat™s chess!ﬂ snapped Ron. ﬁYou™ve got to make some sacr\\nifices! I make my\\n move and she™ll take me Š that leaves you free to checkmate the king, Harry!ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁBut Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁDo you want to stop Snape or not?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁRon Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁLook, if you don™t hurry up, he™ll already have the Stone!ﬂ        There was no alternative.  \\n      ﬁReady?ﬂ Ron called, his face pale but\\n determined. ﬁHere I go Š now, don™t hang around once you™ve won.ﬂ  \\n      He stepped forward, and the white queen pounced. She struck Ron hard across the head with her \\nstone arm, and he crashed to the floor Š Hermione screamed but stayed on her square Š the \\n\\nwhite queen dragged Ron to one side. He looked as if he™d been knocked out.  \\n      Shaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left. \\n\\n \\n      The white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry™s feet. They had won. The chessmen \\nparted and bowed, leaving the door ahead clear. With one last de\\nsperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione charged through the d\\noor and up the next passageway.  \\n      ﬁWhat if he™s Š?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁHe™ll be all right,ﬂ said Harry, trying to convince hims\\nelf. ﬁWhat do you reckon™s next?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWe™ve had Sprout™s, that was the Devil™s Snare; Flitwick must™ve put charms on the keys; \\nMcGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive; that leaves Quirrell™s spell, and \\n\\nSnape™s.ﬂ  \\n      They had reached another door. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁAll right?ﬂ Harry whispered. \\n       ﬁGo on.ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry pushed it open. \\n \\n      A disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of them pull thei\\nr robes up over their noses. Eyes watering, they saw, flat on the floor in front \\nof them, a troll even la\\nrger than the one they had tackled, out cold with a bloody lump on its head. \\n \\n      ﬁI™m glad we didn™t have to fight that one\\n,ﬂ Harry whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its massive legs. ﬁCome on, I can™t breathe.ﬂ \\n \\n      He pulled open the next door, both of them \\nhardly daring to look at what came next - but there \\nwas nothing very frightening in here, just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line. \\n \\n      ﬁSnape™s,ﬂ said Harry. ﬁWhat do we have to do?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      They stepped over the threshold, and imme\\ndiately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway. \\nIt wasn™t ordinary fire either; it was purple. At the same instant, black flames shot up in the \\ndoorway leading onward. They were trapped.        ﬁLook!ﬂ Hermione seized a roll of paper ly\\ning next to the bottles. Harry looked over her shoulder to read it:    Danger lies before you, while safety lies behind,    Two of us will help y\\nou, which ever you would find, \\n \\n  One among us seven will let you move ahead, \\n\\n \\n  Another will transport the drinker back instead, \\n\\n \\n  Two among our number hold only nettle wine, \\n\\n \\n  Three of us are killers\\n, waiting bidden in line.  \\n  Choose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore, \\n\\n \\n  To help you in your choice, we give you these clues four: \\n\\n \\n  First, however slyly th\\ne poison tries to hide  \\n  You will always find some on nettle wine™s left side; \\n\\n \\n  Second, different are thos\\ne who stand at either end,  \\n  But if you would move onward, neither is your friend; \\n\\n \\n  Third, as you see clearly, all are different size, \\n\\n \\n  Neither dwarf nor giant hol\\nds death in their insides;  \\n  Fourth, the second left and the second on the right \\n\\n \\n  Are twins once you taste them, \\nthough different at first sight.  \\n    Hermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amaze\\nd, saw that she was smiling, the very last thing he \\nfelt like doing. \\n \\n      ﬁBrilliant\\n,ﬂ said Hermione. ﬁThis isn™t magic Š it™\\ns logic Š a puzzle. A lot of the greatest \\nwizards haven™t got an ounce of logic, they™d be stuck in here forever.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁBut so will we, won™t we?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n       ﬁOf course not,ﬂ said Hermione. ﬁEverythin\\ng we need is here on this paper. Seven bottles: three are poison; two are wine; one will get us safely\\n through the black fire, and one will get us back \\nthrough the purple.ﬂ       ﬁBut how do we know which to drink?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁGive me a minute.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      Hermione read the paper several times. \\nThen she walked up and down the line of bottles, muttering to herself and pointing at them. At last\\n, she clapped her hands.  \\n      ﬁGot it,ﬂ she said. ﬁThe smallest bottle w\\nill get us through the black fire Š toward the Stone.ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry looked at the tiny bottle. \\n \\n      ﬁThere™s only enough there for one of us,ﬂ he said. ﬁThat™s hardly one swallow.ﬂ  \\n      They looked at each other. \\n \\n      ﬁWhich one will get you \\nback through the purple flames?ﬂ \\n \\n      Hermione pointed at a rounde\\nd bottle at the right end of the line.  \\n      ﬁYou drink that,ﬂ said Harry. ﬁNo, listen, get back and get Ron. Grab brooms from the flying-\\nkey room, they™ll get you out of the trapdoor and \\npast Fluffy Š go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, we need him. I migh\\nt be able to hold Snape off for a while, but I™m \\nno match for him, really.ﬂ \\n       ﬁBut Harry Š what if You-Know-Who™s with him?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWell Š I was lucky once, wasn™t I?ﬂ said \\nHarry, pointing at his scar. ﬁI might get lucky again.ﬂ \\n \\n      Hermione™s lip trembled, and she suddenl\\ny dashed at Harry and threw her arms around him. \\n \\n      ﬁHermione!ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁHarry Š you™re a great wizard, you know.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁI™m not as good as you,ﬂ said Harr\\ny, very embarrassed, as she let go of him. \\n \\n      ﬁMe!ﬂ said Hermione. ﬁBooks! And cleverne\\nss! There are more important things Š friendship \\nand bravery and Š oh Harry Šbe careful! ﬂ  \\n      ﬁYou drink first,ﬂ said Harry. ﬁYou are sure which is which, aren™t you?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁPositive,ﬂ said Hermione. She took \\na long drink from the round bottle at the end, and \\nshuddered.        ﬁIt™s not poison?ﬂ said Harry anxiously. \\n \\n      ﬁNo Š but it™s like ice.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁQuick, go, before it wears off.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁGood luck Š take care.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁGO!ﬂ \\n \\n      Hermione turned and walk\\ned straight through the purple fire.  \\n      Harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle. He turned to face the black flames. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁHere I come,ﬂ he said, and \\nhe drained the little bottle in one gulp.  \\n      It was indeed as though ice was flooding his body. He put the bottle down and walked forward; he braced himself, saw the black flames licking his body, but couldn™t feel them Š for a moment \\n\\nhe could see nothing but dark fire Š then he was on the other side, in the last chamber. \\n \\n      There was already someone there Š but \\nit wasn™t Snape. It wasn™t even Voldemort. \\n \\n          \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n CHAPTER SEVENTEEN \\n  The Man With Two Faces \\n \\n  It was Quirrell. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁYou!ﬂ gasped Harry.  \\n      Quirrell smiled. His \\nface wasn™t twitching at all.  \\n      ﬁMe,ﬂ he said calmly. ﬁI wonde\\nred whether I™d be meeting you here, Potter.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁBut I thought Š Snape Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁSeverus?ﬂ Quirrell laughed, and it wasn™t hi\\ns usual quivering treble, either, but cold and sharp. ﬁYes, Severus does seem the type, doesn™t he? So useful to have him swooping around like an \\novergrown bat. Next to him, who would suspec\\nt p-p-poor, st-stuttering P-Professor Quirrell?ﬂ  \\n      Harry couldn™t take it in. This couldn™t be true, it couldn™t.  \\n      ﬁBut Snape tried to kill me!ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁNo, no, no. I tried to kill you. Your friend Miss Gra\\nnger accidentally knocked me over as she \\nrushed to set fire to Snape at that Quidditch \\nmatch. She broke my eye c\\nontact with you. Another few seconds and I™d have got you off that broom. I™d have managed it before then if Snape \\nhadn™t been muttering a countercurse, trying to save you.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁSnape was trying to save me?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁOf course,ﬂ said Quirrell coolly. ﬁWhy do y\\nou think he wanted to referee your next match? He \\nwas trying to make sure I didn™t do it again. Funn\\ny, really– he needn™t have bothered. I couldn™t do anything with Dumbledore watching. All the ot\\nher teachers thought Snape was trying to stop \\nGryffindor from winning, he \\ndid make himself unpopular– and what\\n a waste of time, when after all that, I™m going to kill you tonight.ﬂ \\n \\n      Quirrell snapped his fingers. Ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped themselves tightly around \\nHarry.  \\n      ﬁYou™re too nosy to live, Potter. Scurrying around the school on Halloween like that, for all I knew you™d seen me coming to look at\\n what was guarding the Stone.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁYou let the troll in?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁCertainly. I have a special gift with trolls Š you must have \\nseen what I did to the one in the chamber back there? Unfortunately, while ev\\neryone else was running around looking for it, Snape, who already suspected me, went straight to\\n the third floor to head me off Š and not only \\ndid my troll fail to beat you to death, that thre\\ne-headed dog didn™t even manage to bite Snape™s \\nleg off properly.        ﬁNow, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this interesting mirror.ﬂ \\n \\n      It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell. It was the Mirror of \\nErised.  \\n      ﬁThis mirror is the key to finding the \\nStone,ﬂ Quirrell murmure\\nd, tapping his way around the frame. ﬁTrust Dumbledore to come up with so\\nmething like this– but he™s in London– I™ll be \\nfar away by the time he gets back–ﬂ \\n \\n      All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him from concentrating on \\nthe mirror. \\n \\n      ﬁI saw you and Snape in the forest Šﬂ he blurted out. \\n \\n      ﬁYes,ﬂ said Quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to look at the back. ﬁHe was on to me by \\nthat time, trying to find out how far I™d got. He \\nsuspected me all along. Tried to frighten me Š \\nas though he could, when I had Lord Voldemort on my side–ﬂ \\n \\n      Quirrell came back out from be\\nhind the mirror and stared hungrily into it. \\n \\n      ﬁI see the Stone– I™m presenting it to my master– but where is it?ﬂ \\n       Harry struggled against the ropes binding him, but they didn™t give. He \\nhad to keep Quirrell from \\ngiving his whole attention to the mirror. \\n       ﬁBut Snape always seemed to hate me so much.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁOh, he does,ﬂ said Quirrell casually, ﬁheavens, yes. He was at\\n Hogwarts with your father, didn™t you know? They loathed each other. But he never wanted you \\ndead.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁBut I heard you a few days ago, \\nsobbing Š I thought Snape was threatening you–ﬂ \\n \\n      For the first time, a spasm \\nof fear flitted across Quirrell™s face. \\n \\n      ﬁSometimes,ﬂ he said, ﬁI find it hard to fo\\nllow my master™s instructions\\n Š he is a great wizard and I am weak Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁYou mean he was there in the classroom with you?ﬂ Harry gasped. \\n \\n      ﬁHe is with me wherever I go,ﬂ said Qu\\nirrell quietly. ﬁI met him when I traveled around the \\nworld. A foolish young man I was then, full of ri\\ndiculous ideas about good and evil. Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong I was. There \\nis no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it– Since then, I have served him faithfully, although I have let him \\ndown many times. He has had to be very hard on \\nme.ﬂ Quirrell shivered suddenly. ﬁHe does not \\nforgive mistakes easily. When I failed to steal th\\ne stone from Gringotts, he\\n was most displeased. \\nHe punished me– decided he would have\\n to keep a closer watch on me–ﬂ \\n       Quirrell™s voice trailed away. Harry was remembering his trip to Diag\\non Alley Š how could he have been so stupid? He™d \\nseen Quirrell there that very day, shaken hands with him in the Leaky \\nCauldron.  \\n      Quirrell cursed under his breath. \\n \\n      ﬁI don™t understand– is the Stone \\ninside\\n the mirror? Should I break it?ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry™s mind was racing. \\n\\n \\n      What I want more than anything else in \\nthe world at the moment, he \\nthought, is to find the Stone before Quirrell does. So if I look in the mirror,\\n I should see myself finding it Š which means I™ll \\nsee where it™s hidden! But how can I look without Quirrell realizing what I™m up to? \\n \\n      He tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass without Quirrell noticing, but the ropes around his ankles were too tight: he tripped and fell over. Quirre\\nll ignored him. He was still \\ntalking to himself. \\n \\n      ﬁWhat does this mirror do? How does it work? Help me, Master!ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      And to Harry™s horror, a voice answered, and the voice seemed to come from Quirrell himself. \\n \\n      ﬁUse the boy– Use the boy–ﬂ \\n \\n      Quirrell rounded on Harry. \\n \\n      ﬁYes Š Potter Š come here.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      He clapped his hands once, and the ropes binding Harry fell off. Harry got slowly to his feet.  \\n      ﬁCome here,ﬂ Quirrell repeated. \\nﬁLook in the mirror and tell me what you see.ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry walked toward him. \\n\\n \\n      I must lie, he thought desperately. I must look and lie about what I see, that™s all.  \\n      Quirrell moved close behind him. Harry breathed in the funny smell that seemed to come from \\nQuirrell™s turban. He closed hi\\ns eyes, stepped in front of the mirror, and opened them again. \\n \\n      He saw his reflection, pale and scared-looking at first. But a moment later, the reflection smiled \\nat him. It put its hand into its pocket and pu\\nlled out a blood-red stone. It winked and put the Stone back in its pocket Š and as it did so, Harry felt something heavy drop into his real pocket. \\nSomehow Š incredibly Š\\nhe™d gotten the Stone.        ﬁWell?ﬂ said Quirrell impatiently. ﬁWhat do you see?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      Harry screwed up his courage. \\n \\n      ﬁI see myself shaking hands with Dumble\\ndore,ﬂ he invented. ﬁI Š I™ve won the house cup for Gryffindor.ﬂ  \\n      Quirrell cursed again. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁGet out of the way,ﬂ he said. As Harry moved aside, he felt the Sorcerer™s Stone against his leg. \\nDare he make a break for it? \\n \\n      But he hadn™t walked five paces before\\n a high voice spoke, though Quirrell wasn™t moving his \\nlips.  \\n      ﬁHe lies– He lies–ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁPotter, come back here!ﬂ Quirrell s\\nhouted. ﬁTell me the truth! What did you just see?ﬂ \\n \\n      The high voice spoke again. \\n \\n      ﬁLet me speak to him– face-to-face–ﬂ \\n\\n       ﬁMaster, you are not strong enough!ﬂ  \\n      ﬁI have strength enough– for this–ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry felt as if Devil™s Snare was rooting him to the spot. He couldn™t move a muscle. Petrified, \\nhe watched as Quirrell reached up and began to unwrap his turban. What was going on? The \\nturban fell away. Quirrell™s head looked strangely small without it. Then he turned slowly on the \\nspot.  \\n      Harry would have screamed, but he couldn™\\nt make a sound. Where there should have been a back \\nto Quirrell™s head, there was a face, the most \\nterrible face Harry had ever seen. It was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake. \\n \\n      ﬁHarry Potter–ﬂ it whispered. \\n\\n \\n      Harry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldn™t move.  \\n      ﬁSee what I have become?ﬂ the face said. \\nﬁMere shadow and vapor– I have form only when I \\ncan share another™s body– but there have always b\\neen those willing to let me into their hearts \\nand minds– Unicorn blood has strengthened me, \\nthese past weeks– you saw faithful Quirrell drinking it for me in the forest– and once I have the Elixir of Life, I will be able to create a \\nbody of my own– Now– why don™t you give\\n me that Stone in your pocket?ﬂ \\n \\n      So he knew. The feeling suddenly surged back into Harry™s legs. He stumbled backward. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁDon™t be a fool,ﬂ snarled the face. ﬁBetter save your own life and join me– or you™ll meet the \\nsame end as your parents– They\\n died begging me for mercy–ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁLIAR!ﬂ Harry shouted suddenly. \\n \\n      Quirrell was walking backward at him, so\\n that Voldemort could still see him. The evil face was \\nnow smiling. \\n \\n      ﬁHow touching–ﬂ it hissed. ﬁI always value bravery– Yes, boy, your parents were brave– I \\nkilled your father first; and he put up a courageous fight– but your mother needn™t have died– \\nshe was trying to protect you– Now give me the \\nStone, unless you want her to have died in vain.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁNEVER!ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry sprang toward the flame door, but\\n Voldemort screamed ﬁSEIZE HIM!ﬂ and the next \\nsecond, Harry felt Quirrell™s hand close on his wrist. At once, a needle-sharp pain seared across Harry™s scar; his head felt as though it was about to split in two; he yelled, struggling with all his might, and to his surprise, Quirre\\nll let go of him. The pain in \\nhis head lessened Š he looked around wildly to see where Quirrell had gone, and saw him hunched in pain, looking at his \\nfingers Š they were blistering before his eyes.  \\n      ﬁSeize him! SEIZE HIM!ﬂ shrieked Vold\\nemort again, and Quirrell lunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet landing on top of him, both hands \\naround Harry™s neck Š Harry™s scar was almost \\nblinding him with pain, yet he could see Quirrell howling in agony.  \\n      ﬁMaster, I cannot hold him Š my hands Š my hands!ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      And Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground with his knees, let go of his neck and stared, bewildered, at his own palms Š Harry could \\nsee they looked burned, raw, red, and shiny.  \\n      ﬁThen kill him, fool, and be done!ﬂ screeched Voldemort. \\n\\n \\n      Quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, but Harry, by instinct, reached up and grabbed Quirrell™s face Š \\n \\n      ﬁAAAARGH!ﬂ \\n \\n      Quirrell rolled off him, his face blistering, too, and then Harry knew: Quirrell couldn™t touch his \\nbare skin, not without suffering terrible pain Š his only chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep him in enough pain to stop him from doing a curse. \\n      Harry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm, and hung \\non as tight as he could. Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry off Š the pain in Harry™s head was building Š he couldn™t \\nsee Š he could only hear Quirrell™s terrible shrieks and Voldemort™s yells of, ﬁKILL HIM! \\nKILL HIM!ﬂ and other voices, maybe in Ha\\nrry™s own head, crying, ﬁHarry! Harry!ﬂ  \\n      He felt Quirrell™s arm wrenched from \\nhis grasp, knew all was lost, and fell into blackness, down– down– down–   \\n  Something gold was glinting just above him. The \\nSnitch! He tried to catch it, but his arms were \\ntoo heavy.  \\n      He blinked. It wasn™t the Snitch at all. It was a pair of glasses. How strange. \\n \\n      He blinked again. The smiling face of \\nAlbus Dumbledore swam into view above him. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁGood afternoon, Harry,ﬂ said Dumbledore. \\n\\n \\n      Harry stared at him. Then he remembered: \\nﬁSir! The Stone! It was Quirrell! He™s got the Stone! \\nSir, quick Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁCalm yourself, dear boy, you are a little be\\nhind the times,ﬂ said Dumbledore. ﬁQuirrell does not \\nhave the Stone.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁThen who does? Sir, I Šﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁHarry, please relax, or Ma\\ndam Pomfrey will have me thrown out.ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry swallowed and looked around him. He \\nrealized he must be in the hospital wing. He was lying in a bed with white linen sheets, and next to him was a ta\\nble piled high with what looked like half the candy shop.  \\n      ﬁTokens from your friends and admirers,ﬂ\\n said Dumbledore, beaming. ﬁWhat happened down in \\nthe dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, s\\no, naturally, the whole school knows. I believe your friends Misters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for \\ntrying to send you a toilet seat. No doubt they thought it would amuse you. Madam Pomfrey, \\nhowever, felt it might not be very\\n hygienic, and confiscated it.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁHow long have I been in here?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁThree days. Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss \\nGranger will be most relieved you have come round, \\nthey have been extremely worried.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁBut sir, the Stone Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁI see you are not to be distracted. Very well, the Stone. Pr\\nofessor Quirrell did not manage to \\ntake it from you. I arrived in time to preven\\nt that, although you were doing very well on your own, I must say.ﬂ \\n       ﬁYou got there? You got Hermione™s owl?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁWe must have crossed in midair. No sooner had I reached London than it became clear to me \\nthat the place I should be was the one I had just left. I arrived just in time to pull Quirrell off \\n\\nyou.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁIt was you.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁI feared I might be too late.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁYou nearly were, I couldn™t have kept him off the Stone much longer Œﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁNot the Stone, boy, you Š the effort involved nearly killed you. For one terrible moment there, \\nI was afraid it had. As for the St\\none, it has been destroyed.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁDestroyed?ﬂ said Harry blankly. ﬁBut your friend Š Nicolas Flamel Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁOh, you know about Nicolas?ﬂ said \\nDumbledore, sounding quite delighted. ﬁYou \\ndid do the thing properly, didn™t you? Well, Nicolas and I have\\n had a little chat, and agreed it™s all for the best.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁBut that means he and his wife will die, won™t they?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁThey have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then, yes, they will die.ﬂ \\n       Dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry™s face. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁTo one as young as you, I™m sure it seems incr\\nedible, but to Nicolas and Perenelle, it really is like going to bed after a very, very\\n long day. After all, to the well-organized mind, death is but \\nthe next great adventure. You know, the Stone was \\nreally not such a wonderful thing. As much \\nmoney and life as you could want! The two things\\n most human beings would choose above all \\nŠ the trouble is, humans do have a knack of choosi\\nng precisely those things that are worst for them.ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry lay there, lost for words. Dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the ceiling. \\n \\n      ﬁSir?ﬂ said Harry. ﬁI™ve been thinking– \\nsir Š even if the Stone™s gone, Vol-, I mean, You-\\nKnow-Who Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁCall him Voldemort, Harry. Always use th\\ne proper name for things. Fear of a name increases \\nfear of the thing itself.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁYes, sir. Well, Voldemort™s going to try ot\\nher ways of coming back, is\\nn™t he? I mean, he hasn™t \\ngone, has he?ﬂ \\n      ﬁNo, Harry, he has not. He is still out there somewhere, perhaps \\nlooking for another body to share– not being truly alive, he cannot be killed. He left Quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies. Nevert\\nheless, Harry, while you may only have delayed his \\nreturn to power, it will merely take someone else\\n who is prepared to fight what seems a losing \\nbattle next time Š and if he is delayed again, and again, why, he may never return to power.ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it \\nmade his head hurt. Then he said, ﬁSir, there are \\nsome other things I™d like to know\\n, if you can tell me– things I wa\\nnt to know the truth about–ﬂ  \\n      ﬁThe truth.ﬂ Dumbledore sighed. ﬁIt is a \\nbeautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution. However, I shall answer your ques\\ntions unless I have a very good reason not to, in which case I beg you™ll forgive me. I shall not, of course, lie.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWell– Voldemort said that he only killed\\n my mother because she tr\\nied to stop him from killing \\nme. But why would he want to kill me in the first place?ﬂ \\n \\n      Dumbledore sighed \\nvery deeply this time. \\n \\n      ﬁAlas, the first thing you ask me, I \\ncannot tell you. Not today. Not now. You will know, one day– put it from your mind for now, Harry. Wh\\nen you are older– I know you hate to hear \\nthis– when you are ready, you will know.ﬂ \\n \\n      And Harry knew it would be no good to argue. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁBut why couldn™t Quirrell touch me?ﬂ \\n\\n       ﬁYour mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand, it is love. He didn™t realize that love as powerful as your moth\\ner™s for you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no \\nvisible sign– to have been loved so deeply, \\neven though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever. It is in your very skin. Quirrell, full of hatred, greed, and \\nambition, sharing his soul with Voldemort, coul\\nd not touch you for this reason. It was agony to touch a person marked by something so good.ﬂ \\n \\n      Dumbledore now became very interested in \\na bird out on the windowsill, which gave Harry time \\nto dry his eyes on the sheet. When he had found \\nhis voice again, Harry said, ﬁAnd the invisibility \\ncloak Š do you know who sent it to me?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁAh Š your father happened to leave it in my possession, and I thought you might like it.ﬂ \\nDumbledore™s eyes twinkled. ﬁUsefu\\nl things– your father used it mainly for sneaking off to the \\nkitchens to steal food when he was here.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁAnd there™s something else–ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁFire away.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁQuirrell said Snape Šﬂ       ﬁProfessor Snape, Harry.ﬂ        ﬁYes, him Š Quirrell said he hates me\\n because he hated my father. Is that true?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁWell, they did rather detest each ot\\nher. Not unlike yourself and Mr. Malfoy. And then, your father did something Snape could never forgive.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWhat?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁHe saved his life.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWhat?ﬂ  \\n      ﬁYes–ﬂ said Dumbledore dreamily. ﬁFunny, th\\ne way people™s minds work, isn™t it? Professor \\nSnape couldn™t bear being in your father™s debt– I do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would make him \\nand your father even. Then he could go back to hating your father™s memory in peace–ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry tried to understand this but it made his head pound, so he stopped. \\n \\n      ﬁAnd sir, there™s one more thing–ﬂ \\n\\n  \\n      ﬁJust the one?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁHow did I get the Stone out of the mirror?ﬂ \\n       ﬁAh, now, I™m glad you asked me that. It wa\\ns one of my more brilliant\\n ideas, and between you and me, that™s saying something. Yo\\nu see, only one who wanted to find the Stone Š find it, but not use it Š would be able to get it, otherwise they™d just see themselves making gold or \\ndrinking Elixir of Life. My brain surprises \\neven me sometimes– Now, enough questions. I \\nsuggest you make a start on these sweets. Ah! \\nBettie Bott™s Every Flavor Beans! I was \\nunfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomit flavored one\\n, and since then I™m afraid \\nI™ve rather lost my liking for them Š but I th\\nink I™ll be safe with a nice toffee, don™t you?ﬂ \\n       He smiled and popped the golden-brown bean \\ninto his mouth. Then he choked and said, ﬁAlas! \\nEar wax!ﬂ  \\n  Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, was \\na nice woman, but very strict. \\n \\n      ﬁJust five minutes,ﬂ Harry pleaded. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁAbsolutely not.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁYou let Professor Dumbledore in–ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁWell, of course, that was the headmaster, quite different. You need \\nrest.ﬂ       ﬁI am resting, look, lying dow\\nn and everything. Oh, go on, Madam Pomfrey–ﬂ \\n       ﬁOh, very well,ﬂ she said. ﬁBut five minutes \\nonly.ﬂ \\n \\n      And she let Ron and Hermione in. \\n\\n \\n     ﬁHarry!ﬂ \\n  \\n      Hermione looked ready to fling her arms \\naround him again, but Harry was glad she held herself \\nin as his head was still very sore.  \\n      ﬁOh, Harry, we were sure you were going to Š Dumbledore \\nwas so worried Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁThe whole school™s talking about it,ﬂ \\nsaid Ron. ﬁWhat \\nreally\\n happened?ﬂ \\n \\n      It was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more st\\nrange and exciting than the wild rumors. Harry told them everything: Quir\\nrell; the mirror; the Stone; and Voldemort. Ron \\n\\nand Hermione were a very good audience; they ga\\nsped in all the right places, and when Harry told them what was under Quirrell™s turban, Hermione screamed out loud. \\n \\n      ﬁSo the Stone™s gone?ﬂ said \\nRon finally. ﬁFlamel™s just going to \\ndie?ﬂ  \\n      ﬁThat™s what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that Š what wa\\ns it? Š ‚to the well-organized mind, \\ndeath is but the next great adventure.™ﬂ  \\n      ﬁI always said he was off his rocker,ﬂ said Ron, looking quite impre\\nssed at how crazy his hero was.  \\n      ﬁSo what happened to you two?ﬂ said Harry. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁWell, I got back all right,ﬂ said Herm\\nione. ﬁI brought Ron round Š that took a while Š and we \\nwere dashing up to the owlery to contact Dumble\\ndore when we met him in\\n the entrance hall Š he already knew Š he just said, ‚Harry™s gone after him, hasn™t he\\n?™ and hurtled off to the third floor.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁD™you think he meant you to do it?ﬂ\\n said Ron. ﬁSending you your father™s cloak and everything?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWell, ﬂ Hermione exploded, ﬁif he did Š I mean to\\n say that™s terrible Š you could have been killed.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁNo, it isn™t,ﬂ said Harry thoughtfully. ﬁHe™s \\na funny man, Dumbledore. I th\\nink he sort of wanted to give me a chance. I think he knows more or\\n less everything that goes on here, you know. I reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try, and instead of stopping us, he just taught us enough to help. I don™t think it was an accident he let me find \\nout how the mirror worked. It™s \\nalmost like he thought I had the right\\n to face Voldemort if I could–ﬂ \\n      ﬁYeah, Dumbledore™s off his rocker, all ri\\nght,ﬂ said Ron proudly. ﬁListen, you™ve got to be up for the end-of-year feast tomorrow. The points \\nare all in and Slytherin won, of course Š you missed the last Quidditch match, we were st\\neamrollered by Ravenclaw without you Š but the \\nfood™ll be good.ﬂ         At that moment\\n, Madam Pomfrey bustled over. \\n \\n      ﬁYou™ve had nearly fifteen minutes, now OUTﬂ she said firmly. \\n\\n \\n    After a good night™s sleep, Harry\\n felt nearly back to normal. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁI want to go to the feast,ﬂ he told Madam Pomfrey as she straight\\nened his many candy boxes. ﬁI \\ncan, can™t I?ﬂ  \\n      ﬁProfessor Dumbledore says you are to be\\n allowed to go,ﬂ she said stiffly, as though in her opinion Professor Dumbledore didn\\n™t realize how risky feasts could be. ﬁAnd you have another \\nvisitor.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁOh, good,ﬂ said Harry. ﬁWho is it?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      Hagrid sidled through the door as he spoke. As usual when he was indoors, Hagrid looked too big to be allowed. He sat down next to Harry, took one look at him, and burst into tears. \\n \\n      ﬁIt™s Š all Š my Š ruddy Š fault!ﬂ he sobbe\\nd, his face in his hands. ﬁI told the evil git how ter get past Fluffy! I told him! It was the only thing he didn™t know, an™ I told him! Yeh could™ve \\n\\ndied! All fer a dragon egg! I™ll never drink again! I should be chucked out an™ made ter live as a \\nMuggle!ﬂ  \\n      ﬁHagrid!ﬂ said Harry, shocked to see Hagrid shaking with grief and remorse, great tears leaking \\ndown into his beard. ﬁHagrid, he™d have found out somehow, this is Voldemort we™re talking \\nabout, he™d have found out even if you hadn™t told him.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁYeh could™ve died!ﬂ sobbed Hagrid. ﬁAn™ don™ say the name!ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁVOLDEMORT!ﬂ Harry bellowed, and Hagrid was so shocked, he stopped crying. ﬁI™ve met \\nhim and I™m calling him by his name. Please cheer \\nup, Hagrid, we saved the Stone, it™s gone, he can™t use it. Have a Chocolate Frog, I™ve got loads–ﬂ  \\n      Hagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said, ﬁThat reminds me. I™ve got yeh a \\npresent.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁIt™s not a stoat sandwich, is it?ﬂ said Harry anxiously, and at \\nlast Hagrid gave a weak chuckle.   \\n      ﬁNah. Dumbledore gave me the day off ye\\nsterday ter fix it. ‚course, he shoulda sacked me \\ninstead Š anyway, got yeh this–ﬂ        It seemed to be a handsome, leather-cov\\nered book. Harry opened it curiously. It was full of wizard photographs. Smiling and waving at him from every page were his mother and father. \\n       ﬁSent owls off ter all yer parents™ old school friends, askin™ fer photos– knew yeh didn™ have any– d™yeh like it?ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry couldn™t speak, but Hagrid understood.  \\n  Harry made his way down to the end-of-year f\\neast alone that night. He had been held up by Madam Pomfrey™s fussing about, in\\nsisting on giving him one last \\ncheckup, so the Great Hall was already full. It was decked out in the Slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate Slytherin™s winning the house cup for the seventh year in a row. A huge banner showing the Slytherin serpent covered the wall \\nbehind the High Table.  \\n      When Harry walked in there was a sudde\\nn hush, and then everybody started talking loudly at once. He slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione at th\\ne Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up to look at him. \\n \\n      Fortunately, Dumbledore arrived \\nmoments later. The babble died away. \\n \\n      ﬁAnother year gone!ﬂ Dumbledore said cheerfully. ﬁAnd I must trouble you with an old man™s \\nwheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast. What a year it has been! \\nHopefully your heads are all a little fuller than they were– you have the whole summer ahead to \\nget them nice and empty before next year starts–  \\n \\n      ﬁNow, as I understand it, the house cup here needs awarding, and the points stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor, with three hundred and twelve points; in third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred \\nand fifty-two; Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty-six and Slytherin, four hundred and seventy-two.ﬂ  \\n      A storm of cheering and stamping broke out\\n from the Slytherin tabl\\ne. Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging his goblet on the table. It was a sickening sight.  \\n      ﬁYes, Yes, well done, Slytherin,ﬂ said Dumb\\nledore. ﬁHowever, recent events must be taken into \\naccount.ﬂ  \\n      The room went very still. The Slytherins™ smiles faded a little. \\n \\n      ﬁAhem,ﬂ said Dumbledore. ﬁI have a few last-minute points to dish out. Let me see. Yes–  \\n\\n \\n      ﬁFirst Š to Mr. Ronald Weasley–ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      Ron went purple in the face; he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn.  \\n      ﬁ– for the best-played game of chess H\\nogwarts has seen in many years, I award Gryffindor \\nhouse fifty points.ﬂ       Gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars overhead seemed to quiver. Percy \\ncould be heard telling the other prefects, ﬁMy brother, you know! My youngest brother! Got past McGonagall™s giant chess set!ﬂ  \\n      At last there was silence again. \\n \\n      ﬁSecond Š to Miss Hermione Granger– for th\\ne use of cool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.ﬂ  \\n      Hermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected she had burst into tears. \\nGryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves Š \\nthey were a hundred points up.  \\n      ﬁThird Š to Mr. Harry Potter–ﬂ said Dumb\\nledore. The room went deadly quiet. ﬁ– for pure \\nnerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house sixty points.ﬂ  \\n      The din was deafening. Those who could add up while yelling themselves hoarse knew that \\nGryffindor now had four hundred and seventy-two points Š exactly the same as Slytherin. They \\nhad tied for the house cup Š if only Dumbledor\\ne had given Harry just one more point. \\n \\n      Dumbledore raised his ha\\nnd. The room gradually fell silent. \\n \\n      ﬁThere are all kinds of courage,ﬂ said Dumbledore, smiling. ﬁIt takes a \\ngreat deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just\\n as much to stand up to our friends. I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville Longbottom.ﬂ \\n \\n      Someone standing outside the Great Hall mi\\nght well have thought some sort of explosion had \\ntaken place, so loud was the noise that erupte\\nd from the Gryffindor table. Harry, Ron, and \\nHermione stood up to yell and cheer as Neville, \\nwhite with shock, disappeared under a pile of people hugging him. He had never won so much \\nas a point for Gryffindor before. Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn™t have looked more stunned and horrified if he™d just had the Body-Bind Curse put on him. \\n \\n      ﬁWhich means,ﬂ Dumbledore called over \\nthe storm of applause, for even Ravenclaw and \\nHufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of Slytherin, ﬁwe need a little change of decoration.ﬂ  \\n      He clapped his hands. In an instant, the green hangings became scarlet and the silver became \\ngold; the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a towering Gryffindor lion took its place. Snape was shaking Professor McGonagall™s hand, with a horrible, forced smile. He caught Harry™s eye \\nand Harry knew at once that Snape™s feelings \\ntoward him hadn™t changed one jot. This didn™t \\nworry Harry. It seemed as though life would be back to normal next year, or as normal as it ever \\n\\nwas at Hogwarts.  \\n      It was the best evening of Harry™s life, better than winning at Quidditch, or Christmas, or \\nknocking out mountain trolls– he woul\\nd never, ever forget tonight.  \\n    Harry had almost forgotten that the exam resu\\nlts were still to come, but\\n come they did. To their \\ngreat surprise, both he and Ron passed with good marks; Hermione, of course, had the best \\ngrades of the first years. Even Neville scraped through, his good Herbology mark making up for \\nhis abysmal Potions one. They had hoped that Goyl\\ne, who was almost as \\nstupid as he was mean, \\nmight be thrown out, but he had passed, too. It \\nwas a shame, but as Ron said, you couldn™t have \\neverything in life.  \\n      And suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, \\ntheir trunks were packed, Neville™s toad was found \\nlurking in a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out to all students, warning them not to use \\nmagic over the holidays (ﬁI always \\nhope they™ll forget to give \\nus these,ﬂ said Fred Weasley \\nsadly); Hagrid was there to take \\nthem down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake; they \\nwere boarding the Hogwarts Express; talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier; eating Bettie Bott™s Every Flavor Bean\\ns as they sped past Muggle towns; pulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; pulling into platform nine and three-quarters \\nat King™s Cross Station.  \\n      It took quite a while for them all to ge\\nt off the platform. A wizened old guard was up by the \\nticket barrier, letting them go through the gate in twos and threes so they didn™t attract attention by all bursting out of a solid wall at once and alarming the Muggles. \\n \\n      ﬁYou must come and stay this summer,ﬂ said Ron, ﬁboth of you Š I™ll send you an owl.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁThanks,ﬂ said Harry, ﬁI™ll need something \\nto look forward to.ﬂ People jostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway back to the Muggle world. Some of them called: \\n \\n      ﬁBye, Harry!ﬂ \\n       ﬁSee you, Potter!ﬂ  \\n      ﬁStill famous,ﬂ said Ron, grinning at him. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁNot where I™m going, I promise you,ﬂ said Harry. \\n\\n \\n      He, Ron, and Hermione passed through the ga\\nteway together. ﬁThere he is, Mom, there he is, \\nlook!ﬂ  \\n      It was Ginny Weasley, Ron™s younger \\nsister, but she wasn™t pointing at Ron.  \\n      ﬁHarry Potter!ﬂ she s\\nquealed. ﬁLook, Mom! I can see Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁBe quiet, Ginny, and it™s rude to point.ﬂ  \\n      Mrs. Weasley smiled down at them. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁBusy year?ﬂ she said. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁVery,ﬂ said Harry. ﬁThanks for the fudge and the sweater, Mrs. Weasley.ﬂ \\n      ﬁOh, it was nothing, dear.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁReady, are you?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      It was Uncle Vernon, still purple-faced, st\\nill mustached, still looking furious at the nerve of \\nHarry, carrying an owl in a cage in a station full of ordinary people. Behind him stood Aunt \\nPetunia and Dudley, looking terrified at the very sight of Harry.  \\n      ﬁYou must be Harry™s family!ﬂ said Mrs. Weasley. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁIn a manner of speaking,ﬂ said Uncle \\nVernon. ﬁHurry up, boy, we haven™t got all day.ﬂ He walked away.  \\n      Harry hung back for a last word with Ron and Hermione. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁSee you over the summer, then.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁHope you have Š er Š a good holiday,ﬂ said Hermione, looking uncertainly after Uncle \\nVernon, shocked that anyone could be so unpleasant.  \\n      ﬁOh, I will,ﬂ said Harry, and they were surp\\nrised at the grin that was spreading over his face. \\nﬁThey don™t know we™re not allowed to use magic at \\nhome. I™m going to have a lot of fun with \\nDudley this summer–ﬂ  \\n            '"

      "[' Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\\'s Stone By J.K. Rowling CHAPTER ONE The Boy Who Lived Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people you\\'d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn\\'t hold with such nonsense. Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere. The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn\\'t think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley\\'s sister, but they hadn\\'t met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn\\'t have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn\\'t want Dudley mixing with a child like that. When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair. None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window. At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls. \"Little tyke,\" chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four\\'s drive. It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar - a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn\\'t realize what he had seen - then he jerked his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn\\'t a map in sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive - no, looking at the sign; cats couldn\\'t read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day. But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn\\'t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn\\'t bear people who dressed in funny clothes - the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren\\'t young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt - these people were obviously collecting for something– yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills. Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor. If he hadn\\'t, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning. He didn\\'t see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he\\'d stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery. He\\'d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker\\'s. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn\\'t know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn\\'t see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were saying. \"The Potters, that\\'s right, that\\'s what I heard - \" \" - yes, their son, Harry - \" Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it. He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking– no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn\\'t such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn\\'t even sure his nephew was called Harry. He\\'d never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her sister. He didn\\'t blame her - if he\\'d had a sister like that– but all the same, those people in cloaks– He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o\\'clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door. \"Sorry,\" he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak. He didn\\'t seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, \"Don\\'t be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!\" And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off. Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn\\'t approve of imagination. As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw - and it didn\\'t improve his mood - was the tabby cat he\\'d spotted that morning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings around its eyes. \"Shoo!\" said Mr. Dursley loudly. The cat didn\\'t move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife. Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door\\'s problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word (\"Won\\'t!\"). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news: \"And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation\\'s owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.\" The newscaster allowed himself a grin. \"Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?\" \"Well, Ted,\" said the weatherman, \"I don\\'t know about that, but it\\'s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they\\'ve had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early - it\\'s not until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight.\" Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters– Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was no good. He\\'d have to say something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. \"Er - Petunia, dear - you haven\\'t heard from your sister lately, have you?\" As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn\\'t have a sister. \"No,\" she said sharply. \"Why?\" \"Funny stuff on the news,\" Mr. Dursley mumbled. \"Owls– shooting stars– and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today–\" \"So?\" snapped Mrs. Dursley. \"Well, I just thought– maybe– it was something to do with– you know– her crowd.\" Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he\\'d heard the name \"Potter.\" He decided he didn\\'t dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, \"Their son - he\\'d be about Dudley\\'s age now, wouldn\\'t he?\" \"I suppose so,\" said Mrs. Dursley stiffly. \"What\\'s his name again? Howard, isn\\'t it?\" \"Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.\" \"Oh, yes,\" said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. \"Yes, I quite agree.\" He didn\\'t say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed. While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden. The cat was still there. It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something. Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the Potters? If it did– if it got out that they were related to a pair of - well, he didn\\'t think he could bear it. The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind– He couldn\\'t see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on - he yawned and turned over - it couldn\\'t affect them– How very wrong he was. Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn\\'t so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all. A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you\\'d have thought he\\'d just popped out of the ground. The cat\\'s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed. Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man\\'s name was Albus Dumbledore. Albus Dumbledore didn\\'t seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, \"I should have known.\" He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He clicked it again - the next lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their window now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn\\'t be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat down on the wall next to the cat. He didn\\'t look at it, but after a moment he spoke to it. \"Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.\" He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She looked distinctly ruffled. \"How did you know it was me?\" she asked. \"My dear Professor, I\\'ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.\" \"You\\'d be stiff if you\\'d been sitting on a brick wall all day,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.\" Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily. \"Oh yes, everyone\\'s celebrating, all right,\" she said impatiently. \"You\\'d think they\\'d be a bit more careful, but no - even the Muggles have noticed something\\'s going on. It was on their news.\" She jerked her head back at the Dursleys\\' dark living-room window. \"I heard it. Flocks of owls– shooting stars– Well, they\\'re not completely stupid. They were bound to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent - I\\'ll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense.\" \"You can\\'t blame them,\" said Dumbledore gently. \"We\\'ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven years.\" \"I know that,\" said Professor McGonagall irritably. \"But that\\'s no reason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.\" She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn\\'t, so she went on. \"A fine thing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he really has gone, Dumbledore?\" \"It certainly seems so,\" said Dumbledore. \"We have much to be thankful for. Would you care for a lemon drop?\" \"A what?\" \"A lemon drop. They\\'re a kind of Muggle sweet I\\'m rather fond of.\" \"No, thank you,\" said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn\\'t think this was the moment for lemon drops. \"As I say, even if You-Know-Who has gone - \" \"My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name? All this ‚You-Know-Who\\' nonsense - for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: Voldemort.\" Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice. \"It all gets so confusing if we keep saying ‚You-Know-Who.\\' I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort\\'s name.\" \"I know you haven\\'t,\" said Professor McGonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring. \"But you\\'re different. Everyone knows you\\'re the only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.\" \"You flatter me,\" said Dumbledore calmly. \"Voldemort had powers I will never have.\" \"Only because you\\'re too - well - noble to use them.\" \"It\\'s lucky it\\'s dark. I haven\\'t blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.\" Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said \"The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around. You know what they\\'re saying? About why he\\'s disappeared? About what finally stopped him?\" It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now. It was plain that whatever \"everyone\" was saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer. \"What they\\'re saying,\" she pressed on, \"is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric\\'s Hollow. He went to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are - are - that they\\'re - dead.\" Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped. \"Lily and James– I can\\'t believe it– I didn\\'t want to believe it– Oh, Albus–\" Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. \"I know– I know–\" he said heavily. Professor McGonagall\\'s voice trembled as she went on. \"That\\'s not all. They\\'re saying he tried to kill the Potter\\'s son, Harry. But he couldn\\'t. He couldn\\'t kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but they\\'re saying that when he couldn\\'t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort\\'s power somehow broke - and that\\'s why he\\'s gone.\" Dumbledore nodded glumly. \"It\\'s - it\\'s true?\" faltered Professor McGonagall. \"After all he\\'s done– all the people he\\'s killed– he couldn\\'t kill a little boy? It\\'s just astounding– of all the things to stop him– but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?\" \"We can only guess.\" said Dumbledore. \"We may never know.\" Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch. It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his pocket and said, \"Hagrid\\'s late. I suppose it was he who told you I\\'d be here, by the way?\" \"Yes,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"And I don\\'t suppose you\\'re going to tell me why you\\'re here, of all places?\" \"I\\'ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They\\'re the only family he has left now.\" \"You don\\'t mean Œ you can\\'t mean the people who live here?\" cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four. \"Dumbledore - you can\\'t. I\\'ve been watching them all day. You couldn\\'t find two people who are less like us. And they\\'ve got this son - I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come and live here!\" \"It\\'s the best place for him,\" said Dumbledore firmly. \"His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he\\'s older. I\\'ve written them a letter.\" \"A letter?\" repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on the wall. \"Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter? These people will never understand him! He\\'ll be famous - a legend - I wouldn\\'t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future - there will be books written about Harry - every child in our world will know his name!\" \"Exactly.\" said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses. \"It would be enough to turn any boy\\'s head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for something he won\\'t even remember! Can you see how much better off he\\'ll be, growing up away from all that until he\\'s ready to take it?\" Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed, and then said, \"Yes - yes, you\\'re right, of course. But how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?\" She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it. \"Hagrid\\'s bringing him.\" \"You think it - wise - to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?\" \"I would trust Hagrid with my life,\" said Dumbledore. \"I\\'m not saying his heart isn\\'t in the right place,\" said Professor McGonagall grudgingly, \"but you can\\'t pretend he\\'s not careless. He does tend to - what was that?\" A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky - and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them. If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild - long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets. \"Hagrid,\" said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. \"At last. And where did you get that motorcycle?\" \"Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,\" said the giant, climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. \"Young Sirius Black lent it to me. I\\'ve got him, sir.\" \"No problems, were there?\" \"No, sir - house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin\\' around. He fell asleep as we was flyin\\' over Bristol.\" Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet-black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning. \"Is that where - ?\" whispered Professor McGonagall. \"Yes,\" said Dumbledore. \"He\\'ll have that scar forever.\" \"Couldn\\'t you do something about it, Dumbledore?\" \"Even if I could, I wouldn\\'t. Scars can come in handy. I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. Well - give him here, Hagrid - we\\'d better get this over with.\" Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys\\' house. \"Could I - could I say good-bye to him, sir?\" asked Hagrid. He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog. \"Shhh!\" hissed Professor McGonagall, \"You\\'ll wake the Muggles!\" \"S-s-sorry,\" sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it. \"But I c-c-can\\'t stand it - Lily an\\' James dead - an\\' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles - \" \"Yes, yes, it\\'s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we\\'ll be found,\" Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door. He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry\\'s blankets, and then came back to the other two. For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid\\'s shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore\\'s eyes seemed to have gone out. \"Well,\" said Dumbledore finally, \"that\\'s that. We\\'ve no business staying here. We may as well go and join the celebrations.\" \"Yeah,\" said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, \"I best get this bike away. G\\'night, Professor McGonagall - Professor Dumbledore, sir.\" Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night. \"I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,\" said Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply. Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street. He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four. \"Good luck, Harry,\" he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone. A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours\\' time by Mrs. Dursley\\'s scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley– He couldn\\'t know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: \"To Harry Potter - the boy who lived!\" CHAPTER TWO The Vanishing Glass Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys\\' front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets - but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too. Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day. \"Up! Get up! Now!\" Harry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again. \"Up!\" she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a good one. There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he\\'d had the same dream before. His aunt was back outside the door. \"Are you up yet?\" she demanded. \"Nearly,\" said Harry. \"Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don\\'t you dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy\\'s birthday.\" Harry groaned. \"What did you say?\" his aunt snapped through the door. \"Nothing, nothing–\" Dudley\\'s birthday - how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept. When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley\\'s birthday presents. It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise - unless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudley\\'s favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn\\'t often catch him. Harry didn\\'t look it, but he was very fast. Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Dudley\\'s, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it. \"In the car crash when your parents died,\" she had said. \"And don\\'t ask questions.\" Don\\'t ask questions - that was the first rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys. Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon. \"Comb your hair!\" he barked, by way of a morning greeting. About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put together, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way - all over the place. Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel - Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig. Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as there wasn\\'t much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. His face fell. \"Thirty-six,\" he said, looking up at his mother and father. \"That\\'s two less than last year.\" \"Darling, you haven\\'t counted Auntie Marge\\'s present, see, it\\'s here under this big one from Mummy and Daddy.\" \"All right, thirty-seven then,\" said Dudley, going red in the face. Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over. Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly, \"And we\\'ll buy you another two presents while we\\'re out today. How\\'s that, popkin? Two more presents. Is that all right\" Dudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said slowly, \"So I\\'ll have thirty– thirty–\" \"Thirty-nine, sweetums,\" said Aunt Petunia. \"Oh.\" Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. \"All right then.\" Uncle Vernon chuckled. \"Little tyke wants his money\\'s worth, just like his father. \\'Atta boy, Dudley!\" He ruffled Dudley\\'s hair. At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR. He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried. \"Bad news, Vernon,\" she said. \"Mrs. Figg\\'s broken her leg. She can\\'t take him.\" She jerked her head in Harry\\'s direction. Dudley\\'s mouth fell open in horror, but Harry\\'s heart gave a leap. Every year on Dudley\\'s birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she\\'d ever owned. \"Now what?\" said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though he\\'d planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken her leg, but it wasn\\'t easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbles, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again. \"We could phone Marge,\" Uncle Vernon suggested. \"Don\\'t be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.\" The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn\\'t there - or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn\\'t understand them, like a slug. \"What about what\\'s-her-name, your friend - Yvonne?\" \"On vacation in Majorca,\" snapped Aunt Petunia. \"You could just leave me here,\" Harry put in hopefully (he\\'d be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley\\'s computer). Aunt Petunia looked as though she\\'d just swallowed a lemon. \"And come back and find the house in ruins?\" she snarled. \"I won\\'t blow up the house,\" said Harry, but they weren\\'t listening. \"I suppose we could take him to the zoo,\" said Aunt Petunia slowly, \"– and leave him in the car–\" \"That car\\'s new, he\\'s not sitting in it alone–\" Dudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn\\'t really crying - it had been years since he\\'d really cried - but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted. \"Dinky Duddydums, don\\'t cry, Mummy won\\'t let him spoil your special day!\" she cried, flinging her arms around him. \"I– don\\'t– want– him– t-t-to come!\" Dudley yelled between huge, pretend sobs. \"He always sp-spoils everything!\" He shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mother\\'s arms. Just then, the doorbell rang - \"Oh, good Lord, they\\'re here!\" said Aunt Petunia frantically - and a moment later, Dudley\\'s best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat. He was usually the one who held people\\'s arms behind their backs while Dudley hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once. Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn\\'t believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys\\' car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn\\'t been able to think of anything else to do with him, but before they\\'d left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside. \"I\\'m warning you,\" he had said, putting his large purple face right up close to Harry\\'s, \"I\\'m warning you now, boy - any funny business, anything at all - and you\\'ll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas.\" \"I\\'m not going to do anything,\" said Harry, \"honestly–\" But Uncle Vernon didn\\'t believe him. No one ever did. The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn\\'t make them happen. Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn\\'t been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left \"to hide that horrible scar.\" Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses. Next morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off. He had been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he couldn\\'t explain how it had grown back so quickly. Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of Dudley\\'s (brown with orange puff balls). The harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn\\'t fit Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry wasn\\'t punished. On the other hand, he\\'d gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens. Dudley\\'s gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to Harry\\'s surprise as anyone else\\'s, there he was sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harry\\'s headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings. But all he\\'d tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid-jump. But today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn\\'t school, his cupboard, or Mrs. Figg\\'s cabbage-smelling living room. While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. He liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning, it was motorcycles. \"– roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,\" he said, as a motorcycle overtook them. \"I had a dream about a motorcycle,\" said Harry, remembering suddenly. \"It was flying.\" Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: \"MOTORCYCLES DON\\'T FLY!\" Dudley and Piers sniggered. \"I know they don\\'t,\" said Harry. \"It was only a dream.\" But he wished he hadn\\'t said anything. If there was one thing the Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldn\\'t, no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon - they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas. It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families. The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. It wasn\\'t bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn\\'t blond. Harry had the best morning he\\'d had in a long time. He was careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn\\'t fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn\\'t have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first. Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to last. After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon\\'s car and crushed it into a trash can - but at the moment it didn\\'t look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep. Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils. \"Make it move,\" he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn\\'t budge. \"Do it again,\" Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on. \"This is boring,\" Dudley moaned. He shuffled away. Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He wouldn\\'t have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself - no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house. The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry\\'s. It winked. Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. They weren\\'t. He looked back at the snake and winked, too. The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly: \"I get that all the time.\" \"I know,\" Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn\\'t sure the snake could hear him. \"It must be really annoying.\" The snake nodded vigorously. \"Where do you come from, anyway?\" Harry asked. The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at it. Boa Constrictor, Brazil. \"Was it nice there?\" The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo. \"Oh, I see - so you\\'ve never been to Brazil?\" As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of them jump. \"DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU WON\\'T BELIEVE WHAT IT\\'S DOING!\" Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could. \"Out of the way, you,\" he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened - one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror. Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor\\'s tank had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits. As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, \"Brazil, here I come– Thanksss, amigo.\" The keeper of the reptile house was in shock. \"But the glass,\" he kept saying, \"where did the glass go?\" The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn\\'t done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon\\'s car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, \"Harry was talking to it, weren\\'t you, Harry?\" Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say, \"Go - cupboard - stay - no meals,\" before he collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy. Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. He didn\\'t know what time it was and he couldn\\'t be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet. Until they were, he couldn\\'t risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food. He\\'d lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as long as he could remember, ever since he\\'d been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash. He couldn\\'t remember being in the car when his parents had died. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on his forehead. This, he supposed, was the crash, though he couldn\\'t imagine where all the green light came from. He couldn\\'t remember his parents at all. His aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask questions. There were no photographs of them in the house. When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the Dursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangers they were, too. A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a closer look. At school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley\\'s gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley\\'s gang. CHAPTER THREE Letters From No One The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his longest-ever punishment. By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his new video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet Drive on her crutches. Harry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley\\'s gang, who visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all quite happy to join in Dudley\\'s favorite sport: Harry Hunting. This was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he could see a tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be going off to secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn\\'t be with Dudley. Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon\\'s old private school, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry, on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school. Dudley thought this was very funny. \"They stuff people\\'s heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall,\" he told Harry. \"Want to come upstairs and practice?\" \"No, thanks,\" said Harry. \"The poor toilet\\'s never had anything as horrible as your head down it - it might be sick.\" Then he ran, before Dudley could work out what he\\'d said. One day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg\\'s. Mrs. Figg wasn\\'t as bad as usual. It turned out she\\'d broken her leg tripping over one of her cats, and she didn\\'t seem quite as fond of them as before. She let Harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though she\\'d had it for several years. That evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brand-new uniform. Smeltings\\' boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange knickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters. They also carried knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren\\'t looking. This was supposed to be good training for later life. As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst into tears and said she couldn\\'t believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he looked so handsome and grown-up. Harry didn\\'t trust himself to speak. He thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh. There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry went in for breakfast. It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink. He went to have a look. The tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water. \"What\\'s this?\" he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question. \"Your new school uniform,\" she said. Harry looked in the bowl again. \"Oh,\" he said, \"I didn\\'t realize it had to be so wet.\" \"Don\\'t be stupid,\" snapped Aunt Petunia. \"I\\'m dyeing some of Dudley\\'s old things gray for you. It\\'ll look just like everyone else\\'s when I\\'ve finished.\" Harry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue. He sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his first day at Stonewall High - like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin, probably. Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from Harry\\'s new uniform. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried everywhere, on the table. They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat. \"Get the mail, Dudley,\" said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper. \"Make Harry get it.\" \"Get the mail, Harry.\" \"Make Dudley get it.\" \"Poke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley.\" Harry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail. Three things lay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon\\'s sister Marge, who was vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a bill, and - a letter for Harry. Harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant elastic band. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him. Who would? He had no friends, no other relatives - he didn\\'t belong to the library, so he\\'d never even got rude notes asking for books back. Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake: Mr. H. Potter The Cupboard under the Stairs 4 Privet Drive Little Whinging Surrey The envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the address was written in emerald-green ink. There was no stamp. Turning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a large letter H. \"Hurry up, boy!\" shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. \"What are you doing, checking for letter bombs?\" He chuckled at his own joke. Harry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter. He handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to open the yellow envelope. Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and flipped over the postcard. \"Marge\\'s ill,\" he informed Aunt Petunia. \"Ate a funny whelk–\" \"Dad!\" said Dudley suddenly. \"Dad, Harry\\'s got something!\" Harry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of his hand by Uncle Vernon. \"That\\'s mine!\" said Harry, trying to snatch it back. \"Who\\'d be writing to you?\" sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it. His face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights. And it didn\\'t stop there. Within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridge. \"P-P-Petunia!\" he gasped. Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held it high out of his reach. Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the first line. For a moment it looked as though she might faint. She clutched her throat and made a choking noise. \"Vernon! Oh my goodness - Vernon!\" They stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry and Dudley were still in the room. Dudley wasn\\'t used to being ignored. He gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick. \"I want to read that letter,\" he said loudly. \"I want to read it,\" said Harry furiously, \"as it\\'s mine.\" \"Get out, both of you,\" croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back inside its envelope. Harry didn\\'t move. \"I WANT MY LETTER!\" he shouted. \"Let me see it!\" demanded Dudley. \"OUT!\" roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the kitchen door behind them. Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry, his glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor. \"Vernon,\" Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, \"look at the address - how could they possibly know where he sleeps? You don\\'t think they\\'re watching the house?\" \"Watching - spying - might be following us,\" muttered Uncle Vernon wildly. \"But what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back? Tell them we don\\'t want - \" Harry could see Uncle Vernon\\'s shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen. \"No,\" he said finally. \"No, we\\'ll ignore it. If they don\\'t get an answer– Yes, that\\'s best– we won\\'t do anything–\" \"But - \" \"I\\'m not having one in the house, Petunia! Didn\\'t we swear when we took him in we\\'d stamp out that dangerous nonsense?\" That evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something he\\'d never done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard. \"Where\\'s my letter?\" said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed through the door. \"Who\\'s writing to me?\" \"No one. It was addressed to you by mistake,\" said Uncle Vernon shortly. \"I have burned it.\" \"It was not a mistake,\" said Harry angrily, \"it had my cupboard on it.\" \"SILENCE!\" yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of spiders fell from the ceiling. He took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile, which looked quite painful. \"Er - yes, Harry - about this cupboard. Your aunt and I have been thinking– you\\'re really getting a bit big for it– we think it might be nice if you moved into Dudley\\'s second bedroom. \"Why?\" said Harry. \"Don\\'t ask questions!\" snapped his uncle. \"Take this stuff upstairs, now.\" The Dursleys\\' house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon\\'s sister, Marge), one where Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldn\\'t fit into his first bedroom. It only took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room. He sat down on the bed and stared around him. Nearly everything in here was broken. The month-old video camera was lying on top of a small, working tank Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor\\'s dog; in the corner was Dudley\\'s first-ever television set, which he\\'d put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled; there was a large birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because Dudley had sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. They were the only things in the room that looked as though they\\'d never been touched. From downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother, \"I don\\'t want him in there– I need that room– make him get out–\" Harry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday he\\'d have given anything to be up here. Today he\\'d rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without it. Next morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. Dudley was in shock. He\\'d screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick, been sick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof, and he still didn\\'t have his room back. Harry was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he\\'d opened the letter in the hall. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly. When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get it. They heard him banging things with his Smelting stick all the way down the hall. Then he shouted, \"There\\'s another one! ‚Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive - \\'\" With a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the hall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the ground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind. After a minute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, with Harry\\'s letter clutched in his hand. \"Go to your cupboard - I mean, your bedroom,\" he wheezed at Harry. \"Dudley - go - just go.\" Harry walked round and round his new room. Someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn\\'t received his first letter. Surely that meant they\\'d try again? And this time he\\'d make sure they didn\\'t fail. He had a plan. The repaired alarm clock rang at six o\\'clock the next morning. Harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently. He mustn\\'t wake the Dursleys. He stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights. He was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive and get the letters for number four first. His heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door - \"AAAAARRRGH!\" Harry leapt into the air; he\\'d trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat - something alive! Lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the big, squashy something had been his uncle\\'s face. Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making sure that Harry didn\\'t do exactly what he\\'d been trying to do. He shouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea. Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon\\'s lap. Harry could see three letters addressed in green ink. \"I want - \" he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into pieces before his eyes. Uncle Vernon didn\\'t go to work that day. He stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot. \"See,\" he explained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, \"if they can\\'t deliver them they\\'ll just give up.\" \"I\\'m not sure that\\'ll work, Vernon.\" \"Oh, these people\\'s minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they\\'re not like you and me,\" said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him. On Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Harry. As they couldn\\'t go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door, slotted through the sides, and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroom. Uncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all the letters, he got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back doors so no one could go out. He hummed \"Tiptoe Through the Tulips\" as he worked, and jumped at small noises. On Saturday, things began to get out of hand. Twenty-four letters to Harry found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt Petunia through the living room window. While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded the letters in her food processor. \"Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly?\" Dudley asked Harry in amazement. On Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill, but happy. \"No post on Sundays,\" he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade on his newspapers, \"no damn letters today - \" Something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head. Next moment, thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one - \"Out! OUT!\" Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall. When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could hear the letters still streaming into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor. \"That does it,\" said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time. \"I want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave. We\\'re going away. Just pack some clothes. No arguments!\" He looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue. Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boarded-up doors and were in the car, speeding toward the highway. Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television, VCR, and computer in his sports bag. They drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn\\'t dare ask where they were going. Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while. \"Shake \\'em off– shake \\'em off,\" he would mutter whenever he did this. They didn\\'t stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall Dudley was howling. He\\'d never had such a bad day in his life. He was hungry, he\\'d missed five television programs he\\'d wanted to see, and he\\'d never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computer. Uncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy-looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city. Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin beds and damp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering– They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day. They had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their table. \"\\'Scuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter? Only I got about an \\'undred of these at the front desk.\" She held up a letter so they could read the green ink address: Mr. H. Potter Room 17 Railview Hotel Cokeworth Harry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his hand out of the way. The woman stared. \"I\\'ll take them,\" said Uncle Vernon, standing up quickly and following her from the dining room. \"Wouldn\\'t it be better just to go home, dear?\" Aunt Petunia suggested timidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn\\'t seem to hear her. Exactly what he was looking for, none of them knew. He drove them into the middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got back in the car, and off they went again. The same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the top of a multilevel parking garage. \"Daddy\\'s gone mad, hasn\\'t he?\" Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully late that afternoon. Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, and disappeared. It started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dudley sniveled. \"It\\'s Monday,\" he told his mother. \"The Great Humberto\\'s on tonight. I want to stay somewhere with a television.\" Monday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was Monday - and you could usually count on Dudley to know the days the week, because of television - then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry\\'s eleventh birthday. Of course, his birthdays were never exactly fun - last year, the Dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon\\'s old socks. Still, you weren\\'t eleven every day. Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was also carrying a long, thin package and didn\\'t answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what he\\'d bought. \"Found the perfect place!\" he said. \"Come on! Everyone out!\" It was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea. Perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine. One thing was certain, there was no television in there. \"Storm forecast for tonight!\" said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping his hands together. \"And this gentleman\\'s kindly agreed to lend us his boat!\" A toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a rather wicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron-gray water below them. \"I\\'ve already got us some rations,\" said Uncle Vernon, \"so all aboard!\" It was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces. After what seemed like hours they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and sliding, led the way to the broken-down house. The inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace was damp and empty. There were only two rooms. Uncle Vernon\\'s rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas. He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up. \"Could do with some of those letters now, eh?\" he said cheerfully. He was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail. Harry privately agreed, though the thought didn\\'t cheer him up at all. As night fell, the promised storm blew up around them. Spray from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy windows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and made up a bed for Dudley on the moth-eaten sofa. She and Uncle Vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket. The storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on. Harry couldn\\'t sleep. He shivered and turned over, trying to get comfortable, his stomach rumbling with hunger. Dudley\\'s snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight. The lighted dial of Dudley\\'s watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told Harry he\\'d be eleven in ten minutes\\' time. He lay and watched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the Dursleys would remember at all, wondering where the letter writer was now. Five minutes to go. Harry heard something creak outside. He hoped the roof wasn\\'t going to fall in, although he might be warmer if it did. Four minutes to go. Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so full of letters when they got back that he\\'d be able to steal one somehow. Three minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock like that? And (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching noise? Was the rock crumbling into the sea? One minute to go and he\\'d be eleven. Thirty seconds– twenty– ten– nine - maybe he\\'d wake Dudley up, just to annoy him - three– two– one– BOOM. The whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, staring at the door. Someone was outside, knocking to come in. CHAPTER FOUR The Keeper of the Keys BOOM. They knocked again. Dudley jerked awake. \"Where\\'s the cannon?\" he said stupidly. There was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernon came skidding into the room. He was holding a rifle in his hands Œ now they knew what had been in the long, thin package he had brought with them. \"Who\\'s there?\" he shouted. \"I warn you - I\\'m armed!\" There was a pause. Then - SMASH! The door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor. A giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His face was almost completely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild, tangled beard, but you could make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles under all the hair. The giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so that his head just brushed the ceiling. He bent down, picked up the door, and fitted it easily back into its frame. The noise of the storm outside dropped a little. He turned to look at them all. \"Couldn\\'t make us a cup o\\' tea, could yeh? It\\'s not been an easy journey–\" He strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen with fear. \"Budge up, yeh great lump,\" said the stranger. Dudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother, who was crouching, terrified, behind Uncle Vernon. \"An\\' here\\'s Harry!\" said the giant. Harry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile. \"Las\\' time I saw you, you was only a baby,\" said the giant. \"Yeh look a lot like yer dad, but yeh\\'ve got yer mom\\'s eyes.\" Uncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise. \"I demand that you leave at once, sir!\" he said. \"You are breaking and entering!\" \"Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,\" said the giant; he reached over the back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon\\'s hands, bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw it into a corner of the room. Uncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden on. \"Anyway - Harry,\" said the giant, turning his back on the Dursleys, \"a very happy birthday to yeh. Got summat fer yeh here - I mighta sat on it at some point, but it\\'ll taste all right.\" From an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly squashed box. Harry opened it with trembling fingers. Inside was a large, sticky chocolate cake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it in green icing. Harry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank you, but the words got lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead was, \"Who are you?\" The giant chuckled. \"True, I haven\\'t introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.\" He held out an enormous hand and shook Harry\\'s whole arm. \"What about that tea then, eh?\" he said, rubbing his hands together. \"I\\'d not say no ter summat stronger if yeh\\'ve got it, mind.\" His eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and he snorted. He bent down over the fireplace; they couldn\\'t see what he was doing but when he drew back a second later, there was a roaring fire there. It filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and Harry felt the warmth wash over him as though he\\'d sunk into a hot bath. The giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged under his weight, and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat: a copper kettle, a squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, several chipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea. Soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage. Nobody said a thing while the giant was working, but as he slid the first six fat, juicy, slightly burnt sausages from the poker, Dudley fidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon said sharply, \"Don\\'t touch anything he gives you, Dudley.\" The giant chuckled darkly. \"Yer great puddin\\' of a son don\\' need fattenin\\' anymore, Dursley, don\\' worry.\" He passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted anything so wonderful, but he still couldn\\'t take his eyes off the giant. Finally, as nobody seemed about to explain anything, he said, \"I\\'m sorry, but I still don\\'t really know who you are.\" The giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. \"Call me Hagrid,\" he said, \"everyone does. An\\' like I told yeh, I\\'m Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts - yeh\\'ll know all about Hogwarts, o\\' course. \"Er - no,\" said Harry. Hagrid looked shocked. \"Sorry,\" Harry said quickly. \"Sorry?\" barked Hagrid, turning to stare at the Dursleys, who shrank back into the shadows. \"It\\'s them as should be sorry! I knew yeh weren\\'t gettin\\' yer letters but I never thought yeh wouldn\\'t even know abou\\' Hogwarts, fer cryin\\' out loud! Did yeh never wonder where yer parents learned it all?\" \"All what?\" asked Harry. \"ALL WHAT?\" Hagrid thundered. \"Now wait jus\\' one second!\" He had leapt to his feet. In his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut. The Dursleys were cowering against the wall. \"Do you mean ter tell me,\" he growled at the Dursleys, \"that this boy - this boy! - knows nothin\\' abou\\' - about ANYTHING?\" Harry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to school, after all, and his marks weren\\'t bad. \"I know some things,\" he said. \"I can, you know, do math and stuff.\" But Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, \"About our world, I mean. Your world. My world. Yer parents\\' world.\" \"What world?\" Hagrid looked as if he was about to explode. \"DURSLEY!\" he boomed. Uncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something that sounded like \"Mimblewimble.\" Hagrid stared wildly at Harry. \"But yeh must know about yer mom and dad,\" he said. \"I mean, they\\'re famous. You\\'re famous.\" \"What? My - my mom and dad weren\\'t famous, were they?\" \"Yeh don\\' know– yeh don\\' know–\" Hagrid ran his fingers through his hair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare. \"Yeh don\\' know what yeh are?\" he said finally. Uncle Vernon suddenly found his voice. \"Stop!\" he commanded. \"Stop right there, sir! I forbid you to tell the boy anything!\" A braver man than Vernon Dursley would have quailed under the furious look Hagrid now gave him; when Hagrid spoke, his every syllable trembled with rage. \"You never told him? Never told him what was in the letter Dumbledore left fer him? I was there! I saw Dumbledore leave it, Dursley! An\\' you\\'ve kept it from him all these years?\" \"Kept what from me?\" said Harry eagerly. \"STOP! I FORBID YOU!\" yelled Uncle Vernon in panic. Aunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror. \"Ah, go boil yer heads, both of yeh,\" said Hagrid. \"Harry - yer a wizard.\" There was silence inside the hut. Only the sea and the whistling wind could be heard. \"I\\'m a what?\" gasped Harry. \"A wizard, o\\' course,\" said Hagrid, sitting back down on the sofa, which groaned and sank even lower, \"an\\' a thumpin\\' good ‚un, I\\'d say, once yeh\\'ve been trained up a bit. With a mum an\\' dad like yours, what else would yeh be? An\\' I reckon it\\'s abou\\' time yeh read yer letter.\" Harry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish envelope, addressed in emerald green to Mr. H. Potter, The Floor, Hut-on-the-Rock, The Sea. He pulled out the letter and read: HOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY Headmaster: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE (Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. Warlock, Supreme Mugwump, International Confed. of Wizards) Dear Mr. Potter, We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment. Term begins on September 1. We await your owl by no later than July 31. Yours sincerely, Minerva McGonagall, Deputy Headmistress Questions exploded inside Harry\\'s head like fireworks and he couldn\\'t decide which to ask first. After a few minutes he stammered, \"What does it mean, they await my owl?\" \"Gallopin\\' Gorgons, that reminds me,\" said Hagrid, clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from yet another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl - a real, live, rather ruffled-looking owl - a long quill, and a roll of parchment. With his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down: Dear Professor Dumbledore, Given Harry his letter. Taking him to buy his things tomorrow. Weather\\'s horrible. Hope you\\'re well. Hagrid Hagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which clamped it in its beak, went to the door, and threw the owl out into the storm. Then he came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the telephone. Harry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly. \"Where was I?\" said Hagrid, but at that moment, Uncle Vernon, still ashen-faced but looking very angry, moved into the firelight. \"He\\'s not going,\" he said. Hagrid grunted. \"I\\'d like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him,\" he said. \"A what?\" said Harry, interested. \"A Muggle,\" said Hagrid, \"it\\'s what we call nonmagic folk like them. An\\' it\\'s your bad luck you grew up in a family o\\' the biggest Muggles I ever laid eyes on.\" \"We swore when we took him in we\\'d put a stop to that rubbish,\" said Uncle Vernon, \"swore we\\'d stamp it out of him! Wizard indeed!\" \"You knew?\" said Harry. \"You knew I\\'m a - a wizard?\" \"Knew!\" shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly. \"Knew! Of course we knew! How could you not be, my dratted sister being what she was? Oh, she got a letter just like that and disappeared off to that - that school - and came home every vacation with her pockets full of frog spawn, turning teacups into rats. I was the only one who saw her for what she was - a freak! But for my mother and father, oh no, it was Lily this and Lily that, they were proud of having a witch in the family!\" She stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on. It seemed she had been wanting to say all this for years. \"Then she met that Potter at school and they left and got married and had you, and of course I knew you\\'d be just the same, just as strange, just as - as - abnormal - and then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up and we got landed with you!\" Harry had gone very white. As soon as he found his voice he said, \"Blown up? You told me they died in a car crash!\" \"CAR CRASH!\" roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrily that the Dursleys scuttled back to their corner. \"How could a car crash kill Lily an\\' James Potter? It\\'s an outrage! A scandal! Harry Potter not knowin\\' his own story when every kid in our world knows his name!\" \"But why? What happened?\" Harry asked urgently. The anger faded from Hagrid\\'s face. He looked suddenly anxious. \"I never expected this,\" he said, in a low, worried voice. \"I had no idea, when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin\\' hold of yeh, how much yeh didn\\'t know. Ah, Harry, I don\\' know if I\\'m the right person ter tell yeh - but someone\\'s gotta - yeh can\\'t go off ter Hogwarts not knowin\\'.\" He threw a dirty look at the Dursleys. \"Well, it\\'s best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh - mind, I can\\'t tell yeh everythin\\', it\\'s a great myst\\'ry, parts of it–\" He sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds, and then said, \"It begins, I suppose, with - with a person called - but it\\'s incredible yeh don\\'t know his name, everyone in our world knows - \" \"Who?\" \"Well - I don\\' like sayin\\' the name if I can help it. No one does.\" \"Why not?\" \"Gulpin\\' gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared. Blimey, this is difficult. See, there was this wizard who went– bad. As bad as you could go. Worse. Worse than worse. His name was–\" Hagrid gulped, but no words came out. \"Could you write it down?\" Harry suggested. \"Nah - can\\'t spell it. All right - Voldemort. \" Hagrid shuddered. \"Don\\' make me say it again. Anyway, this - this wizard, about twenty years ago now, started lookin\\' fer followers. Got ‚em, too - some were afraid, some just wanted a bit o\\' his power, ‚cause he was gettin\\' himself power, all right. Dark days, Harry. Didn\\'t know who ter trust, didn\\'t dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches– terrible things happened. He was takin\\' over. ‚Course, some stood up to him - an\\' he killed ‚em. Horribly. One o\\' the only safe places left was Hogwarts. Reckon Dumbledore\\'s the only one You-Know-Who was afraid of. Didn\\'t dare try takin\\' the school, not jus\\' then, anyway. \"Now, yer mum an\\' dad were as good a witch an\\' wizard as I ever knew. Head boy an\\' girl at Hogwarts in their day! Suppose the myst\\'ry is why You-Know-Who never tried to get ‚em on his side before– probably knew they were too close ter Dumbledore ter want anythin\\' ter do with the Dark Side. \"Maybe he thought he could persuade ‚em– maybe he just wanted ‚em outta the way. All anyone knows is, he turned up in the village where you was all living, on Halloween ten years ago. You was just a year old. He came ter yer house an\\' - an\\' - \" Hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted handkerchief and blew his nose with a sound like a foghorn. \"Sorry,\" he said. \"But it\\'s that sad - knew yer mum an\\' dad, an\\' nicer people yeh couldn\\'t find - anywa– \"You-Know-Who killed ‚em. An\\' then - an\\' this is the real myst\\'ry of the thing - he tried to kill you, too. Wanted ter make a clean job of it, I suppose, or maybe he just liked killin\\' by then. But he couldn\\'t do it. Never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead? That was no ordinary cut. That\\'s what yeh get when a powerful, evil curse touches yeh - took care of yer mum an\\' dad an\\' yer house, even - but it didn\\'t work on you, an\\' that\\'s why yer famous, Harry. No one ever lived after he decided ter kill \\'em, no one except you, an\\' he\\'d killed some o\\' the best witches an\\' wizards of the age - the McKinnons, the Bones, the Prewetts - an\\' you was only a baby, an\\' you lived.\" Something very painful was going on in Harry\\'s mind. As Hagrid\\'s story came to a close, he saw again the blinding flash of green light, more clearly than he had ever remembered it before - and he remembered something else, for the first time in his life: a high, cold, cruel laugh. Hagrid was watching him sadly. \"Took yeh from the ruined house myself, on Dumbledore\\'s orders. Brought yeh ter this lot– .\" \"Load of old tosh,\" said Uncle Vernon. Harry jumped; he had almost forgotten that the Dursleys were there. Uncle Vernon certainly seemed to have got back his courage. He was glaring at Hagrid and his fists were clenched. \"Now, you listen here, boy,\" he snarled, \"I accept there\\'s something strange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldn\\'t have cured - and as for all this about your parents, well, they were weirdoes, no denying it, and the world\\'s better off without them in my opinion - asked for all they got, getting mixed up with these wizarding types - just what I expected, always knew they\\'d come to a sticky end - \" But at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink umbrella from inside his coat. Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like a sword, he said, \"I\\'m warning you, Dursley - I\\'m warning you - one more word–\" In danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant, Uncle Vernon\\'s courage failed again; he flattened himself against the wall and fell silent. \"That\\'s better,\" said Hagrid, breathing heavily and sitting back down on the sofa, which this time sagged right down to the floor. Harry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, hundreds of them. \"But what happened to Vol-, sorry - I mean, You-Know-Who?\" \"Good question, Harry. Disappeared. Vanished. Same night he tried ter kill you. Makes yeh even more famous. That\\'s the biggest myst\\'ry, see– he was gettin\\' more an\\' more powerful - why\\'d he go? \"Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die. Some say he\\'s still out there, bidin\\' his time, like, but I don\\' believe it. People who was on his side came back ter ours. Some of ‚em came outta kinda trances. Don\\' reckon they could\\'ve done if he was comin\\' back. \"Most of us reckon he\\'s still out there somewhere but lost his powers. Too weak to carry on. \\'Cause somethin\\' about you finished him, Harry. There was somethin\\' goin\\' on that night he hadn\\'t counted on - I dunno what it was, no one does - but somethin\\' about you stumped him, all right.\" Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes, but Harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake. A wizard? Him? How could he possibly be? He\\'d spent his life being clouted by Dudley, and bullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon; if he was really a wizard, why hadn\\'t they been turned into warty toads every time they\\'d tried to lock him in his cupboard? If he\\'d once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world, how come Dudley had always been able to kick him around like a football? \"Hagrid,\" he said quietly, \"I think you must have made a mistake. I don\\'t think I can be a wizard.\" To his surprise, Hagrid chuckled. \"Not a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when you was scared or angry?\" Harry looked into the fire. Now he came to think about it– every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when he, Harry, had been upset or angry– chased by Dudley\\'s gang, he had somehow found himself out of their reach– dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut, he\\'d managed to make it grow back– and the very last time Dudley had hit him, hadn\\'t he got his revenge, without even realizing he was doing it? Hadn\\'t he set a boa constrictor on him? Harry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was positively beaming at him. \"See?\" said Hagrid. \"Harry Potter, not a wizard - you wait, you\\'ll be right famous at Hogwarts.\" But Uncle Vernon wasn\\'t going to give in without a fight. \"Haven\\'t I told you he\\'s not going?\" he hissed. \"He\\'s going to Stonewall High and he\\'ll be grateful for it. I\\'ve read those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbish - spell books and wands and - \" \"If he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won\\'t stop him,\" growled Hagrid. \"Stop Lily an\\' James Potter\\'s son goin\\' ter Hogwarts! Yer mad. His name\\'s been down ever since he was born. He\\'s off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world. Seven years there and he won\\'t know himself. He\\'ll be with youngsters of his own sort, fer a change, an\\' he\\'ll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had Albus Dumbled - \" \"I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL TO TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!\" yelled Uncle Vernon. But he had finally gone too far. Hagrid seized his umbrella and whirled it over his head, \"NEVER - \" he thundered, \" - INSULT - ALBUS - DUMBLEDORE - IN - FRONT - OF - ME!\" He brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at Dudley - there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling in pain. When he turned his back on them, Harry saw a curly pig\\'s tail poking through a hole in his trousers. Uncle Vernon roared. Pulling Aunt Petunia and Dudley into the other room, he cast one last terrified look at Hagrid and slammed the door behind them. Hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard. \"Shouldn\\'ta lost me temper,\" he said ruefully, \"but it didn\\'t work anyway. Meant ter turn him into a pig, but I suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there wasn\\'t much left ter do.\" He cast a sideways look at Harry under his bushy eyebrows. \"Be grateful if yeh didn\\'t mention that ter anyone at Hogwarts,\" he said. \"I\\'m - er - not supposed ter do magic, strictly speakin\\'. I was allowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh an\\' get yer letters to yeh an\\' stuff - one o\\' the reasons I was so keen ter take on the job.\" \"Why aren\\'t you supposed to do magic?\" asked Harry. \"Oh, well - I was at Hogwarts meself but I - er - got expelled, ter tell yeh the truth. In me third year. They snapped me wand in half an\\' everything. But Dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper. Great man, Dumbledore.\" \"Why were you expelled?\" \"It\\'s gettin\\' late and we\\'ve got lots ter do tomorrow,\" said Hagrid loudly. \"Gotta get up ter town, get all yer books an\\' that.\" He took off his thick black coat and threw it to Harry. \"You can kip under that,\" he said. \"Don\\' mind if it wriggles a bit, I think I still got a couple o\\' doormice in one o\\' the pockets.\" CHAPTER FIVE Diagon Alley Harry woke early the next morning. Although he could tell it was daylight, he kept his eyes shut tight. It was a dream, he told himself firmly. I dreamed a giant called Hagrid came to tell me I was going to a school for wizards. When I open my eyes I\\'ll be at home in my cupboard. There was suddenly a loud tapping noise. And there\\'s Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, Harry thought, his heart sinking. But he still didn\\'t open his eyes. It had been such a good dream. Tap. Tap. Tap. \"All right,\" Harry mumbled, \"I\\'m getting up.\" He sat up and Hagrid\\'s heavy coat fell off him. The hut was full of sunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa, and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window, a newspaper held in its beak. Harry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though a large balloon was swelling inside him. He went straight to the window and jerked it open. The owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid, who didn\\'t wake up. The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack Hagrid\\'s coat. \"Don\\'t do that.\" Harry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat. \"Hagrid!\" said Harry loudly. \"There\\'s an owl - \" \"Pay him,\" Hagrid grunted into the sofa. \"What?\" \"He wants payin\\' fer deliverin\\' the paper. Look in the pockets.\" Hagrid\\'s coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets - bunches of keys, slug pellets, balls of string, peppermint humbugs, teabags– finally, Harry pulled out a handful of strange-looking coins. \"Give him five Knuts,\" said Hagrid sleepily. \"Knuts?\" \"The little bronze ones.\" Harry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl held out his leg so Harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it. Then he flew off through the open window. Hagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched. \"Best be off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter London an\\' buy all yer stuff fer school.\" Harry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them. He had just thought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon inside him had got a puncture. \"Um - Hagrid?\" \"Mm?\" said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge boots. \"I haven\\'t got any money - and you heard Uncle Vernon last night– he won\\'t pay for me to go and learn magic.\" \"Don\\'t worry about that,\" said Hagrid, standing up and scratching his head. \"D\\'yeh think yer parents didn\\'t leave yeh anything?\" \"But if their house was destroyed - \" \"They didn\\' keep their gold in the house, boy! Nah, first stop fer us is Gringotts. Wizards\\' bank. Have a sausage, they\\'re not bad cold - an\\' I wouldn\\' say no teh a bit o\\' yer birthday cake, neither.\" \"Wizards have banks?\" \"Just the one. Gringotts. Run by goblins.\" Harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding. \"Goblins?\" \"Yeah - so yeh\\'d be mad ter try an\\' rob it, I\\'ll tell yeh that. Never mess with goblins, Harry. Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter keep safe - ‚cept maybe Hogwarts. As a matter o\\' fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway. Fer Dumbledore. Hogwarts business.\" Hagrid drew himself up proudly. \"He usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him. Fetchin\\' you - gettin\\' things from Gringotts - knows he can trust me, see.\" \"Got everythin\\'? Come on, then.\" Harry followed Hagrid out onto the rock. The sky was quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight. The boat Uncle Vernon had hired was still there, with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm. \"How did you get here?\" Harry asked, looking around for another boat. \"Flew,\" said Hagrid. \"Flew?\" \"Yeah - but we\\'ll go back in this. Not s\\'pposed ter use magic now I\\'ve got yeh.\" They settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at Hagrid, trying to imagine him flying. \"Seems a shame ter row, though,\" said Hagrid, giving Harry another of his sideways looks. \"If I was ter - er - speed things up a bit, would yeh mind not mentionin\\' it at Hogwarts?\" \"Of course not,\" said Harry, eager to see more magic. Hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again, tapped it twice on the side of the boat, and they sped off toward land. \"Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?\" Harry asked. \"Spells - enchantments,\" said Hagrid, unfolding his newspaper as he spoke. \"They say there\\'s dragons guardin\\' the high security vaults. And then yeh gotta find yer way - Gringotts is hundreds of miles under London, see. Deep under the Underground. Yeh\\'d die of hunger tryin\\' ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat.\" Harry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his newspaper, the Daily Prophet. Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to be left alone while they did this, but it was very difficult, he\\'d never had so many questions in his life. \"Ministry o\\' Magic messin\\' things up as usual,\" Hagrid muttered, turning the page. \"There\\'s a Ministry of Magic?\" Harry asked, before he could stop himself. \"\\'Course,\" said Hagrid. \"They wanted Dumbledore fer Minister, o\\' course, but he\\'d never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the job. Bungler if ever there was one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every morning, askin\\' fer advice.\" \"But what does a Ministry of Magic do?\" \"Well, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that there\\'s still witches an\\' wizards up an\\' down the country.\" \"Why?\" \"Why? Blimey, Harry, everyone\\'d be wantin\\' magic solutions to their problems. Nah, we\\'re best left alone.\" At this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall. Hagrid folded up his newspaper, and they clambered up the stone steps onto the street. Passersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town to the station. Harry couldn\\'t blame them. Not only was Hagrid twice as tall as anyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly, \"See that, Harry? Things these Muggles dream up, eh?\" \"Hagrid,\" said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, \"did you say there are dragons at Gringotts?\" \"Well, so they say,\" said Hagrid. \"Crikey, I\\'d like a dragon.\" \"You\\'d like one?\" \"Wanted one ever since I was a kid - here we go.\" They had reached the station. There was a train to London in five minutes\\' time. Hagrid, who didn\\'t understand \"Muggle money,\" as he called it, gave the bills to Harry so he could buy their tickets. People stared more than ever on the train. Hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a canary-yellow circus tent. \"Still got yer letter, Harry?\" he asked as he counted stitches. Harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket. \"Good,\" said Hagrid. \"There\\'s a list there of everything yeh need.\" Harry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn\\'t noticed the night before, and read: HOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY UNIFORM First-year students will require: 1. Three sets of plain work robes (black) 2. One plain pointed hat (black) for day wear 3. One pair of protective gloves (dragon hide or similar) 4. One winter cloak (black, silver fastenings) Please note that all pupils\\' clothes should carry name tags COURSE BOOKS All students should have a copy of each of the following: The Standard Book of Spells (Grade 1)by Miranda Goshawk A History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot Magical Theory by Adalbert Waffling A Beginners\\' Guide to Transfiguration by Emeric Switch One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi by Phyllida Spore Magical Drafts and Potions by Arsenius Jigger Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them by Newt Scamander The Dark Forces: A Guide to Self-Protection by Quentin Trimble OTHER EQUIPMENT 1 wand 1 cauldron (pewter, standard size 2) 1 set of glass or crystal phials 1 telescope set 1 brass scales Students may also bring an owl OR a cat OR a toad PARENTS ARE REMINDED THAT FIRST YEARS ARE NOT ALLOWED THEIR OWN BROOMSTICKS \"Can we buy all this in London?\" Harry wondered aloud. \"If yeh know where to go,\" said Hagrid. Harry had never been to London before. Although Hagrid seemed to know where he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground, and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow. \"I don\\'t know how the Muggles manage without magic,\" he said as they climbed a broken-down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shops. Hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all Harry had to do was keep close behind him. They passed book shops and music stores, hamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as if it could sell you a magic wand. This was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people. Could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them? Were there really shops that sold spell books and broomsticks? Might this not all be some huge joke that the Dursleys had cooked up? If Harry hadn\\'t known that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, he might have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything Hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn\\'t help trusting him. \"This is it,\" said Hagrid, coming to a halt, \"the Leaky Cauldron. It\\'s a famous place.\" It was a tiny, grubby-looking pub. If Hagrid hadn\\'t pointed it out, Harry wouldn\\'t have noticed it was there. The people hurrying by didn\\'t glance at it. Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldn\\'t see the Leaky Cauldron at all. In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it. Before he could mention this, Hagrid had steered him inside. For a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A few old women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry. One of them was smoking a long pipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender, who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut. The low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in. Everyone seemed to know Hagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, \"The usual, Hagrid?\" \"Can\\'t, Tom, I\\'m on Hogwarts business,\" said Hagrid, clapping his great hand on Harry\\'s shoulder and making Harry\\'s knees buckle. \"Good Lord,\" said the bartender, peering at Harry, \"is this - can this be - ?\" The Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent. \"Bless my soul,\" whispered the old bartender, \"Harry Potter– what an honor.\" He hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and seized his hand, tears in his eyes. \"Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.\" Harry didn\\'t know what to say. Everyone was looking at him. The old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out. Hagrid was beaming. Then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment, Harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron. \"Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can\\'t believe I\\'m meeting you at last.\" \"So proud, Mr. Potter, I\\'m just so proud.\" \"Always wanted to shake your hand - I\\'m all of a flutter.\" \"Delighted, Mr. Potter, just can\\'t tell you, Diggle\\'s the name, Dedalus Diggle.\" \"I\\'ve seen you before!\" said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle\\'s top hat fell off in his excitement. \"You bowed to me once in a shop.\" \"He remembers!\" cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around at everyone. \"Did you hear that? He remembers me!\" Harry shook hands again and again - Doris Crockford kept coming back for more. A pale young man made his way forward, very nervously. One of his eyes was twitching. \"Professor Quirrell!\" said Hagrid. \"Harry, Professor Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts.\" \"P-P-Potter,\" stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry\\'s hand, \"c-can\\'t t-tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you.\" \"What sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?\" \"D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,\" muttered Professor Quirrell, as though he\\'d rather not think about it. \"N-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?\" He laughed nervously. \"You\\'ll be g-getting all your equipment, I suppose? I\\'ve g-got to p-pick up a new b-book on vampires, m-myself.\" He looked terrified at the very thought. But the others wouldn\\'t let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself. It took almost ten minutes to get away from them all. At last, Hagrid managed to make himself heard over the babble. \"Must get on - lots ter buy. Come on, Harry.\" Doris Crockford shook Harry\\'s hand one last time, and Hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds. Hagrid grinned at Harry. \"Told yeh, didn\\'t I? Told yeh you was famous. Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin\\' ter meet yeh - mind you, he\\'s usually tremblin\\'.\" \"Is he always that nervous?\" \"Oh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine while he was studyin\\' outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experience– They say he met vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a nasty bit o\\' trouble with a hag - never been the same since. Scared of the students, scared of his own subject - now, where\\'s me umbrella?\" Vampires? Hags? Harry\\'s head was swimming. Hagrid, meanwhile, was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can. \"Three up– two across–\" he muttered. \"Right, stand back, Harry.\" He tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella. The brick he had touched quivered - it wriggled - in the middle, a small hole appeared - it grew wider and wider - a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight. \"Welcome,\" said Hagrid, \"to Diagon Alley.\" He grinned at Harry\\'s amazement. They stepped through the archway. Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall. The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop. Cauldrons - All Sizes - Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver - Self-Stirring - Collapsible, said a sign hanging over them. \"Yeah, you\\'ll be needin\\' one,\" said Hagrid, \"but we gotta get yer money first.\" Harry wished he had about eight more eyes. He turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at once: the shops, the things outside them, the people doing their shopping. A plump woman outside an Apothecary was shaking her head as they passed, saying, \"Dragon liver, sixteen Sickles an ounce, they\\'re mad–\" A low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops Owl Emporium - Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys of about Harry\\'s age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it. \"Look,\" Harry heard one of them say, \"the new Nimbus Two Thousand - fastest ever - \" There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels\\' eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon– \"Gringotts,\" said Hagrid. They had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shops. Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold, was - \"Yeah, that\\'s a goblin,\" said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward him. The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry. He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very long fingers and feet. He bowed as they walked inside. Now they were facing a second pair of doors, silver this time, with words engraved upon them: Enter, stranger, but take heed Of what awaits the sin of greed, For those who take, but do not earn, Must pay most dearly in their turn. So if you seek beneath our floors A treasure that was never yours, Thief, you have been warned, beware Of finding more than treasure there. \"Like I said, Yeh\\'d be mad ter try an\\' rob it,\" said Hagrid. A pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a vast marble hall. About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in brass scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses. There were too many doors to count leading off the hall, and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of these. Hagrid and Harry made for the counter. \"Morning,\" said Hagrid to a free goblin. \"We\\'ve come ter take some money outta Mr. Harry Potter\\'s safe.\" \"You have his key, sir?\" \"Got it here somewhere,\" said Hagrid, and he started emptying his pockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblin\\'s book of numbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals. \"Got it,\" said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key. The goblin looked at it closely. \"That seems to be in order.\" \"An\\' I\\'ve also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore,\" said Hagrid importantly, throwing out his chest. \"It\\'s about the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen.\" The goblin read the letter carefully. \"Very well,\" he said, handing it back to Hagrid, \"I will have someone take you down to both vaults. Griphook!\" Griphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall. \"What\\'s the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?\" Harry asked. \"Can\\'t tell yeh that,\" said Hagrid mysteriously. \"Very secret. Hogwarts business. Dumbledore\\'s trusted me. More\\'n my job\\'s worth ter tell yeh that.\" Griphook held the door open for them. Harry, who had expected more marble, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches. It sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor. Griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward them. They climbed in - Hagrid with some difficulty - and were off. At first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages. Harry tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible. The rattling cart seemed to know its own way, because Griphook wasn\\'t steering. Harry\\'s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them wide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late - they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor. \"I never know,\" Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart, \"what\\'s the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?\" \"Stalagmite\\'s got an ‚m\\' in it,\" said Hagrid. \"An\\' don\\' ask me questions just now, I think I\\'m gonna be sick.\" He did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from trembling. Griphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came billowing out, and as it cleared, Harry gasped. Inside were mounds of gold coins. Columns of silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts. \"All yours,\" smiled Hagrid. All Harry\\'s - it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn\\'t have known about this or they\\'d have had it from him faster than blinking. How often had they complained how much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London. Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag. \"The gold ones are Galleons,\" he explained. \"Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it\\'s easy enough. Right, that should be enough fer a couple o\\' terms, we\\'ll keep the rest safe for yeh.\" He turned to Griphook. \"Vault seven hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more slowly?\" \"One speed only,\" said Griphook. They were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. They went rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck. Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole. \"Stand back,\" said Griphook importantly. He stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away. \"If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they\\'d be sucked through the door and trapped in there,\" said Griphook. \"How often do you check to see if anyone\\'s inside?\" Harry asked. \"About once every ten years,\" said Griphook with a rather nasty grin. Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault, Harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least - but at first he thought it was empty. Then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor. Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry longed to know what it was, but knew better than to ask. \"Come on, back in this infernal cart, and don\\'t talk to me on the way back, it\\'s best if I keep me mouth shut,\" said Hagrid. One wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside Gringotts. Harry didn\\'t know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money. He didn\\'t have to know how many Galleons there were to a pound to know that he was holding more money than he\\'d had in his whole life - more money than even Dudley had ever had. \"Might as well get yer uniform,\" said Hagrid, nodding toward Madam Malkin\\'s Robes for All Occasions. \"Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them Gringotts carts.\" He did still look a bit sick, so Harry entered Madam Malkin\\'s shop alone, feeling nervous. Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve. \"Hogwarts, dear?\" she said, when Harry started to speak. \"Got the lot here - another young man being fitted up just now, in fact.\" In the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes. Madam Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him slipped a long robe over his head, and began to pin it to the right length. \"Hello,\" said the boy, \"Hogwarts, too?\" \"Yes,\" said Harry. \"My father\\'s next door buying my books and mother\\'s up the street looking at wands,\" said the boy. He had a bored, drawling voice. \"Then I\\'m going to drag them off to look at racing brooms. I don\\'t see why first years can\\'t have their own. I think I\\'ll bully father into getting me one and I\\'ll smuggle it in somehow.\" Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley. \"Have you got your own broom?\" the boy went on. \"No,\" said Harry. \"Play Quidditch at all?\" \"No,\" Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be. \"I do - Father says it\\'s a crime if I\\'m not picked to play for my house, and I must say, I agree. Know what house you\\'ll be in yet?\" \"No,\" said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute. \"Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I\\'ll be in Slytherin, all our family have been - imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I\\'d leave, wouldn\\'t you?\" \"Mmm,\" said Harry, wishing he could say something a bit more interesting. \"I say, look at that man!\" said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the front window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldn\\'t come in. \"That\\'s Hagrid,\" said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn\\'t. \"He works at Hogwarts.\" \"Oh,\" said the boy, \"I\\'ve heard of him. He\\'s a sort of servant, isn\\'t he?\" \"He\\'s the gamekeeper,\" said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less every second. \"Yes, exactly. I heard he\\'s a sort of savage - lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire to his bed.\" \"I think he\\'s brilliant,\" said Harry coldly. \"Do you?\" said the boy, with a slight sneer. \"Why is he with you? Where are your parents?\" \"They\\'re dead,\" said Harry shortly. He didn\\'t feel much like going into the matter with this boy. \"Oh, sorry,\" said the other, not sounding sorry at all. \"But they were our kind, weren\\'t they?\" \"They were a witch and wizard, if that\\'s what you mean.\" \"I really don\\'t think they should let the other sort in, do you? They\\'re just not the same, they\\'ve never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families. What\\'s your surname, anyway?\" But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, \"That\\'s you done, my dear,\" and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down from the footstool. \"Well, I\\'ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,\" said the drawling boy. Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought him (chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts). \"What\\'s up?\" said Hagrid. \"Nothing,\" Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment and quills. Harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote. When they had left the shop, he said, \"Hagrid, what\\'s Quidditch?\" \"Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin\\' how little yeh know - not knowin\\' about Quidditch!\" \"Don\\'t make me feel worse,\" said Harry. He told Hagrid about the pale boy in Madam Malkin\\'s. \" - and he said people from Muggle families shouldn\\'t even be allowed in - \" \"Yer not from a Muggle family. If he\\'d known who yeh were - he\\'s grown up knowin\\' yer name if his parents are wizardin\\' folk. You saw what everyone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh. Anyway, what does he know about it, some o\\' the best I ever saw were the only ones with magic in ‚em in a long line o\\' Muggles - look at yer mum! Look what she had fer a sister!\" \"So what is Quidditch?\" \"It\\'s our sport. Wizard sport. It\\'s like - like soccer in the Muggle world - everyone follows Quidditch - played up in the air on broomsticks and there\\'s four balls - sorta hard ter explain the rules.\" \"And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?\" \"School houses. There\\'s four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o\\' duffers, but - \" \"I bet I\\'m in Hufflepuff,\" said Harry gloomily. \"Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,\" said Hagrid darkly. \"There\\'s not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn\\'t in Slytherin. You-Know-Who was one.\" \"Vol-, sorry - You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?\" \"Years an\\' years ago,\" said Hagrid. They bought Harry\\'s school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all. Even Dudley, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his hands on some of these. Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from Curses and Countercurses (Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, Tongue-Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor Vindictus Viridian. \"I was trying to find out how to curse Dudley.\" \"I\\'m not sayin\\' that\\'s not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic in the Muggle world except in very special circumstances,\" said Hagrid. \"An\\' anyway, yeh couldn\\' work any of them curses yet, yeh\\'ll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level.\" Hagrid wouldn\\'t let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either (\"It says pewter on yer list\"), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope. Then they visited the Apothecary, which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders lined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, and snarled claws hung from the ceiling. While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery-black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop). Outside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry\\'s list again. \"Just yer wand left - A yeah, an\\' I still haven\\'t got yeh a birthday present.\" Harry felt himself go red. \"You don\\'t have to - \" \"I know I don\\'t have to. Tell yeh what, I\\'ll get yer animal. Not a toad, toads went outta fashion years ago, yeh\\'d be laughed at - an\\' I don\\' like cats, they make me sneeze. I\\'ll get yer an owl. All the kids want owls, they\\'re dead useful, carry yer mail an\\' everythin\\'.\" Twenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which had been dark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel-bright eyes. Harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with her head under her wing. He couldn\\'t stop stammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor Quirrell. \"Don\\' mention it,\" said Hagrid gruffly. \"Don\\' expect you\\'ve had a lotta presents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivanders left now - only place fer wands, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand.\" A magic wand– this was what Harry had been really looking forward to. The last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over the door read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. A single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window. A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair that Hagrid sat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling. For some reason, the back of his neck prickled. The very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic. \"Good afternoon,\" said a soft voice. Harry jumped. Hagrid must have jumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the spindly chair. An old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the shop. \"Hello,\" said Harry awkwardly. \"Ah yes,\" said the man. \"Yes, yes. I thought I\\'d be seeing you soon. Harry Potter.\" It wasn\\'t a question. \"You have your mother\\'s eyes. It seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand. Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for charm work.\" Mr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished he would blink. Those silvery eyes were a bit creepy. \"Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand. Eleven inches. Pliable. A little more power and excellent for transfiguration. Well, I say your father favored it - it\\'s really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course.\" Mr. Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost nose to nose. Harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes. \"And that\\'s where–\" Mr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry\\'s forehead with a long, white finger. \"I\\'m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,\" he said softly. \"Thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong hands– well, if I\\'d known what that wand was going out into the world to do–\" He shook his head and then, to Harry\\'s relief, spotted Hagrid. \"Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again– Oak, sixteen inches, rather bendy, wasn\\'t it?\" \"It was, sir, yes,\" said Hagrid. \"Good wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled?\" said Mr. Ollivander, suddenly stern. \"Er - yes, they did, yes,\" said Hagrid, shuffling his feet. \"I\\'ve still got the pieces, though,\" he added brightly. \"But you don\\'t use them?\" said Mr. Ollivander sharply. \"Oh, no, sir,\" said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke. \"Hmmm,\" said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a piercing look. \"Well, now - Mr. Potter. Let me see.\" He pulled a long tape measure with silver markings out of his pocket. \"Which is your wand arm?\" \"Er - well, I\\'m right-handed,\" said Harry. \"Hold out your arm. That\\'s it.\" He measured Harry from shoulder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and round his head. As he measured, he said, \"Every Ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter. We use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the same. And of course, you will never get such good results with another wizard\\'s wand.\" Harry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was measuring between his nostrils, was doing this on its own. Mr. Ollivander was flitting around the shelves, taking down boxes. \"That will do,\" he said, and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the floor. \"Right then, Mr. Potter. Try this one. Beechwood and dragon heartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. just take it and give it a wave.\" Harry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a bit, but Mr. Ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once. \"Maple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite whippy. Try - \" Harry tried - but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, was snatched back by Mr. Ollivander. \"No, no - here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches, springy. Go on, go on, try it out.\" Harry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr. Ollivander was waiting for. The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair, but the more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled from the shelves, the happier he seemed to become. \"Tricky customer, eh? Not to worry, we\\'ll find the perfect match here somewhere - I wonder, now - yes, why not - unusual combination - holly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple.\" Harry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He raised the wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid whooped and clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried, \"Oh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well– how curious– how very curious–\" He put Harry\\'s wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper, still muttering, \"Curious– curious–\" \"Sorry,\" said Harry, \"but what\\'s curious?\" Mr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare. \"I remember every wand I\\'ve ever sold, Mr. Potter. Every single wand. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another feather - just one other. It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother - why, its brother gave you that scar.\" Harry swallowed. \"Yes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these things happen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember– I think we must expect great things from you, Mr. Potter– After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things - terrible, yes, but great.\" Harry shivered. He wasn\\'t sure he liked Mr. Ollivander too much. He paid seven gold Galleons for his wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from his shop. The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made their way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back through the Leaky Cauldron, now empty. Harry didn\\'t speak at all as they walked down the road; he didn\\'t even notice how much people were gawking at them on the Underground, laden as they were with all their funny-shaped packages, with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on Harry\\'s lap. Up another escalator, out into Paddington station; Harry only realized where they were when Hagrid tapped him on the shoulder. \"Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,\" he said. He bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat them. Harry kept looking around. Everything looked so strange, somehow. \"You all right, Harry? Yer very quiet,\" said Hagrid. Harry wasn\\'t sure he could explain. He\\'d just had the best birthday of his life - and yet - he chewed his hamburger, trying to find the words. \"Everyone thinks I\\'m special,\" he said at last. \"All those people in the Leaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr. Ollivander– but I don\\'t know anything about magic at all. How can they expect great things? I\\'m famous and I can\\'t even remember what I\\'m famous for. I don\\'t know what happened when Vol-, sorry - I mean, the night my parents died.\" Hagrid leaned across the table. Behind the wild beard and eyebrows he wore a very kind smile. \"Don\\' you worry, Harry. You\\'ll learn fast enough. Everyone starts at the beginning at Hogwarts, you\\'ll be just fine. Just be yerself. I know it\\'s hard. Yeh\\'ve been singled out, an\\' that\\'s always hard. But yeh\\'ll have a great time at Hogwarts - I did - still do, \\'smatter of fact.\" Hagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back to the Dursleys, then handed him an envelope. \"Yer ticket fer Hogwarts, \" he said. \"First o\\' September - King\\'s Cross - it\\'s all on yer ticket. Any problems with the Dursleys, send me a letter with yer owl, she\\'ll know where to find me– . See yeh soon, Harry.\" The train pulled out of the station. Harry wanted to watch Hagrid until he was out of sight; he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against the window, but he blinked and Hagrid had gone. CHAPTER SIX The Journey From Platform Nine and Three-Quarters Harry\\'s last month with the Dursleys wasn\\'t fun. True, Dudley was now so scared of Harry he wouldn\\'t stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn\\'t shut Harry in his cupboard, force him to do anything, or shout at him - in fact, they didn\\'t speak to him at all. Half terrified, half furious, they acted as though any chair with Harry in it were empty. Although this was an improvement in many ways, it did become a bit depressing after a while. Harry kept to his room, with his new owl for company. He had decided to call her Hedwig, a name he had found in A History of Magic. His school books were very interesting. He lay on his bed reading late into the night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased. It was lucky that Aunt Petunia didn\\'t come in to vacuum anymore, because Hedwig kept bringing back dead mice. Every night before he went to sleep, Harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall, counting down to September the first. On the last day of August he thought he\\'d better speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to King\\'s Cross station the next day, so he went down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on television. He cleared his throat to let them know he was there, and Dudley screamed and ran from the room. \"Er - Uncle Vernon?\" Uncle Vernon grunted to show he was listening. \"Er - I need to be at King\\'s Cross tomorrow to - to go to Hogwarts.\" Uncle Vernon grunted again. \"Would it be all right if you gave me a lift?\" Grunt. Harry supposed that meant yes. \"Thank you.\" He was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon actually spoke. \"Funny way to get to a wizards\\' school, the train. Magic carpets all got punctures, have they?\" Harry didn\\'t say anything. \"Where is this school, anyway?\" \"I don\\'t know,\" said Harry, realizing this for the first time. He pulled the ticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket. \"I just take the train from platform nine and three-quarters at eleven o\\'clock,\" he read. His aunt and uncle stared. \"Platform what?\" \"Nine and three-quarters.\" \"Don\\'t talk rubbish,\" said Uncle Vernon. \"There is no platform nine and three-quarters.\" \"It\\'s on my ticket.\" \"Barking,\" said Uncle Vernon, \"howling mad, the lot of them. You\\'ll see. You just wait. All right, we\\'ll take you to King\\'s Cross. We\\'re going up to London tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn\\'t bother.\" \"Why are you going to London?\" Harry asked, trying to keep things friendly. \"Taking Dudley to the hospital,\" growled Uncle Vernon. \"Got to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings.\" Harry woke at five o\\'clock the next morning and was too excited and nervous to go back to sleep. He got up and pulled on his jeans because he didn\\'t want to walk into the station in his wizard\\'s robes - he\\'d change on the train. He checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her cage, and then paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up. Two hours later, Harry\\'s huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the Dursleys\\' car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had set off. They reached King\\'s Cross at half past ten. Uncle Vernon dumped Harry\\'s trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him. Harry thought this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face. \"Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine - platform ten. Your platform should be somewhere in the middle, but they don\\'t seem to have built it yet, do they?\" He was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic number nine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it, and in the middle, nothing at all. \"Have a good term,\" said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile. He left without another word. Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away. All three of them were laughing. Harry\\'s mouth went rather dry. What on earth was he going to do? He was starting to attract a lot of funny looks, because of Hedwig. He\\'d have to ask someone. He stopped a passing guard, but didn\\'t dare mention platform nine and three-quarters. The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry couldn\\'t even tell him what part of the country it was in, he started to get annoyed, as though Harry was being stupid on purpose. Getting desperate, Harry asked for the train that left at eleven o\\'clock, but the guard said there wasn\\'t one. In the end the guard strode away, muttering about time wasters. Harry was now trying hard not to panic. According to the large clock over the arrivals board, he had ten minutes left to get on the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it; he was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl. Hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do, like tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley. He wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector\\'s stand between platforms nine and ten. At that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a few words of what they were saying. \" - packed with Muggles, of course - \" Harry swung round. The speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming red hair. Each of them was pushing a trunk like Harry\\'s in front of him - and they had an owl. Heart hammering, Harry pushed his cart after them. They stopped and so did he, just near enough to hear what they were saying. \"Now, what\\'s the platform number?\" said the boys\\' mother. \"Nine and three-quarters!\" piped a small girl, also red-headed, who was holding her hand, \"Mom, can\\'t I go–\" \"You\\'re not old enough, Ginny, now be quiet. All right, Percy, you go first.\" What looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and ten. Harry watched, careful not to blink in case he missed it - but just as the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms, a large crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last backpack had cleared away, the boy had vanished. \"Fred, you next,\" the plump woman said. \"I\\'m not Fred, I\\'m George,\" said the boy. \"Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother? Can\\'t you tell I\\'m George?\" \"Sorry, George, dear.\" \"Only joking, I am Fred,\" said the boy, and off he went. His twin called after him to hurry up, and he must have done so, because a second later, he had gone - but how had he done it? Now the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier he was almost there - and then, quite suddenly, he wasn\\'t anywhere. There was nothing else for it. \"Excuse me,\" Harry said to the plump woman. \"Hello, dear,\" she said. \"First time at Hogwarts? Ron\\'s new, too.\" She pointed at the last and youngest of her sons. He was tall, thin, and gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose. \"Yes,\" said Harry. \"The thing is - the thing is, I don\\'t know how to - \" \"How to get onto the platform?\" she said kindly, and Harry nodded. \"Not to worry,\" she said. \"All you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten. Don\\'t stop and don\\'t be scared you\\'ll crash into it, that\\'s very important. Best do it at a bit of a run if you\\'re nervous. Go on, go now before Ron.\" \"Er - okay,\" said Harry. He pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier. It looked very solid. He started to walk toward it. People jostled him on their way to platforms nine and ten. Harry walked more quickly. He was going to smash right into that barrier and then he\\'d be in trouble - leaning forward on his cart, he broke into a heavy run - the barrier was coming nearer and nearer - he wouldn\\'t be able to stop - the cart was out of control - he was a foot away - he closed his eyes ready for the crash - It didn\\'t come– he kept on running– he opened his eyes. A scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people. A sign overhead said Hogwarts\\' Express, eleven o\\'clock. Harry looked behind him and saw a wrought-iron archway where the barrier had been, with the words Platform Nine and Three-Quarters on it, He had done it. Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd, while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs. Owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunks. The first few carriages were already packed with students, some hanging out of the window to talk to their families, some fighting over seats. Harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat. He passed a round-faced boy who was saying, \"Gran, I\\'ve lost my toad again.\" \"Oh, Neville,\" he heard the old woman sigh. A boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd. \"Give us a look, Lee, go on.\" The boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the people around him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long, hairy leg. Harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment near the end of the train. He put Hedwig inside first and then started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door. He tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his foot. \"Want a hand?\" It was one of the red-haired twins he\\'d followed through the barrier. \"Yes, please,\" Harry panted. \"Oy, Fred! C\\'mere and help!\" With the twins\\' help, Harry\\'s trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of the compartment. \"Thanks,\" said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes. \"What\\'s that?\" said one of the twins suddenly, pointing at Harry\\'s lightning scar. \"Blimey,\" said the other twin. \"Are you - ?\" \"He is,\" said the first twin. \"Aren\\'t you?\" he added to Harry. \"What?\" said Harry. \"Harry Potter.\" chorused the twins. \"Oh, him,\" said Harry. \"I mean, yes, I am.\" The two boys gawked at him, and Harry felt himself turning red. Then, to his relief, a voice came floating in through the train\\'s open door. \"Fred? George? Are you there?\" \"Coming, Mom.\" With a last look at Harry, the twins hopped off the train. Harry sat down next to the window where, half hidden, he could watch the red-haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying. Their mother had just taken out her handkerchief. \"Ron, you\\'ve got something on your nose.\" The youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she grabbed him and began rubbing the end of his nose. \"Mom - geroff\" He wriggled free. \"Aaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie?\" said one of the twins. \"Shut up,\" said Ron. \"Where\\'s Percy?\" said their mother. \"He\\'s coming now.\" The oldest boy came striding into sight. He had already changed into his billowing black Hogwarts robes, and Harry noticed a red and gold badge on his chest with the letter P on it. \"Can\\'t stay long, Mother,\" he said. \"I\\'m up front, the prefects have got two compartments to themselves - \" \"Oh, are you a prefect, Percy?\" said one of the twins, with an air of great surprise. \"You should have said something, we had no idea.\" \"Hang on, I think I remember him saying something about it,\" said the other twin. \"Once - \" \"Or twice - \" \"A minute - \" \"All summer - \" \"Oh, shut up,\" said Percy the Prefect. \"How come Percy gets new robes, anyway?\" said one of the twins. \"Because he\\'s a prefect,\" said their mother fondly. \"All right, dear, well, have a good term - send me an owl when you get there.\" She kissed Percy on the cheek and he left. Then she turned to the twins. \"Now, you two - this year, you behave yourselves. If I get one more owl telling me you\\'ve - you\\'ve blown up a toilet or - \" \"Blown up a toilet? We\\'ve never blown up a toilet.\" \"Great idea though, thanks, Mom.\" \"It\\'s not funny. And look after Ron.\" \"Don\\'t worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us.\" \"Shut up,\" said Ron again. He was almost as tall as the twins already and his nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it. \"Hey, Mom, guess what? Guess who we just met on the train?\" Harry leaned back quickly so they couldn\\'t see him looking. \"You know that black-haired boy who was near us in the station? Know who he is?\" \"Who?\" \"Harry Potter!\" Harry heard the little girl\\'s voice. \"Oh, Mom, can I go on the train and see him, Mom, eh please–\" \"You\\'ve already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boy isn\\'t something you goggle at in a zoo. Is he really, Fred? How do you know?\" \"Asked him. Saw his scar. It\\'s really there - like lightning.\" \"Poor dear - no wonder he was alone, I wondered. He was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the platform.\" \"Never mind that, do you think he remembers what You-Know-Who looks like?\" Their mother suddenly became very stern. \"I forbid you to ask him, Fred. No, don\\'t you dare. As though he needs reminding of that on his first day at school.\" \"All right, keep your hair on.\" A whistle sounded. \"Hurry up!\" their mother said, and the three boys clambered onto the train. They leaned out of the window for her to kiss them good-bye, and their younger sister began to cry. \"Don\\'t, Ginny, we\\'ll send you loads of owls.\" \"We\\'ll send you a Hogwarts\\' toilet seat.\" \"George!\" \"Only joking, Mom.\" The train began to move. Harry saw the boys\\' mother waving and their sister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep up with the train until it gathered too much speed, then she fell back and waved. Harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the corner. Houses flashed past the window. Harry felt a great leap of excitement. He didn\\'t know what he was going to - but it had to be better than what he was leaving behind. The door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy came in. \"Anyone sitting there?\" he asked, pointing at the seat opposite Harry. \"Everywhere else is full.\" Harry shook his head and the boy sat down. He glanced at Harry and then looked quickly out of the window, pretending he hadn\\'t looked. Harry saw he still had a black mark on his nose. \"Hey, Ron.\" The twins were back. \"Listen, we\\'re going down the middle of the train - Lee Jordan\\'s got a giant tarantula down there.\" \"Right,\" mumbled Ron. \"Harry,\" said the other twin, \"did we introduce ourselves? Fred and George Weasley. And this is Ron, our brother. See you later, then.\" \"Bye,\" said Harry and Ron. The twins slid the compartment door shut behind them. \"Are you really Harry Potter?\" Ron blurted out. Harry nodded. \"Oh - well, I thought it might be one of Fred and George\\'s jokes,\" said Ron. \"And have you really got - you know–\" He pointed at Harry\\'s forehead. Harry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar. Ron stared. \"So that\\'s where You-Know-Who - ?\" \"Yes,\" said Harry, \"but I can\\'t remember it.\" \"Nothing?\" said Ron eagerly. \"Well - I remember a lot of green light, but nothing else.\" \"Wow,\" said Ron. He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments, then, as though he had suddenly realized what he was doing, he looked quickly out of the window again. \"Are all your family wizards?\" asked Harry, who found Ron just as interesting as Ron found him. \"Er - Yes, I think so,\" said Ron. \"I think Mom\\'s got a second cousin who\\'s an accountant, but we never talk about him.\" \"So you must know loads of magic already.\" The Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy in Diagon Alley had talked about. \"I heard you went to live with Muggles,\" said Ron. \"What are they like?\" \"Horrible - well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are, though. Wish I\\'d had three wizard brothers.\" \"Five,\" said Ron. For some reason, he was looking gloomy. \"I\\'m the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I\\'ve got a lot to live up to. Bill and Charlie have already left - Bill was head boy and Charlie was captain of Quidditch. Now Percy\\'s a prefect. Fred and George mess around a lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they\\'re really funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the others, but if I do, it\\'s no big deal, because they did it first. You never get anything new, either, with five brothers. I\\'ve got Bill\\'s old robes, Charlie\\'s old wand, and Percy\\'s old rat.\" Ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was asleep. \"His name\\'s Scabbers and he\\'s useless, he hardly ever wakes up. Percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldn\\'t aff - I mean, I got Scabbers instead.\" Ron\\'s ears went pink. He seemed to think he\\'d said too much, because he went back to staring out of the window. Harry didn\\'t think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl. After all, he\\'d never had any money in his life until a month ago, and he told Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley\\'s old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents. This seemed to cheer Ron up. \"– and until Hagrid told me, I didn\\'t know anything about being a wizard or about my parents or Voldemort - \" Ron gasped. \"What?\" said Harry. \"You said You-Know-Who\\'s name!\" said Ron, sounding both shocked and impressed. \"I\\'d have thought you, of all people - \" \"I\\'m not trying to be brave or anything, saying the name,\" said Harry, \"I just never knew you shouldn\\'t. See what I mean? I\\'ve got loads to learn– I bet,\" he added, voicing for the first time something that had been worrying him a lot lately, \"I bet I\\'m the worst in the class.\" \"You won\\'t be. There\\'s loads of people who come from Muggle families and they learn quick enough.\" While they had been talking, the train had carried them out of London. Now they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep. They were quiet for a time, watching the fields and lanes flick past. Around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back their door and said, \"Anything off the cart, dears?\" Harry, who hadn\\'t had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, but Ron\\'s ears went pink again and he muttered that he\\'d brought sandwiches. Harry went out into the corridor. He had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys, and now that he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many Mars Bars as he could carry - but the woman didn\\'t have Mars Bars. What she did have were Bettie Bott\\'s Every Flavor Beans, Drooble\\'s Best Blowing Gum, Chocolate Frogs. Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice Wands, and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in his life. Not wanting to miss anything, he got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts. Ron stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat. \"Hungry, are you?\" \"Starving,\" said Harry, taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty. Ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it. There were four sandwiches inside. He pulled one of them apart and said, \"She always forgets I don\\'t like corned beef..\" \"Swap you for one of these,\" said Harry, holding up a pasty. \"Go on - \" \"You don\\'t want this, it\\'s all dry,\" said Ron. \"She hasn\\'t got much time,\" he added quickly, \"you know, with five of us.\" \"Go on, have a pasty,\" said Harry, who had never had anything to share before or, indeed, anyone to share it with. It was a nice feeling, sitting there with Ron, eating their way through all Harry\\'s pasties, cakes, and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten). \"What are these?\" Harry asked Ron, holding up a pack of Chocolate Frogs. \"They\\'re not really frogs, are they?\" He was starting to feel that nothing would surprise him. \"No,\" said Ron. \"But see what the card is. I\\'m missing Agrippa.\" \"What?\" \"Oh, of course, you wouldn\\'t know - Chocolate Frogs have cards, inside them, you know, to collect - famous witches and wizards. I\\'ve got about five hundred, but I haven\\'t got Agrippa or Ptolemy.\" Harry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card. It showed a man\\'s face. He wore half-moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and flowing silver hair, beard, and mustache. Underneath the picture was the name Albus Dumbledore. \"So this is Dumbledore!\" said Harry. \"Don\\'t tell me you\\'d never heard of Dumbledore!\" said Ron. \"Can I have a frog? I might get Agrippa - thanks - \" Harry turned over his card and read: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE CURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon\\'s blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling. Harry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that Dumbledore\\'s face had disappeared. \"He\\'s gone!\" \"Well, you can\\'t expect him to hang around all day,\" said Ron. \"He\\'ll be back. No, I\\'ve got Morgana again and I\\'ve got about six of her– do you want it? You can start collecting.\" Ron\\'s eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be unwrapped. \"Help yourself,\" said Harry. \"But in, you know, the Muggle world, people just stay put in photos.\" \"Do they? What, they don\\'t move at all?\" Ron sounded amazed. \"Weird!\" Harry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him a small smile. Ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry couldn\\'t keep his eyes off them. Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of Woodcroft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin. He finally tore his eyes away from the Druidess Cliodna, who was scratching her nose, to open a bag of Bertie Bott\\'s Every Flavor Beans. \"You want to be careful with those,\" Ron warned Harry. \"When they say every flavor, they mean every flavor - you know, you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and marmalade, but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe. George reckons he had a booger-flavored one once.\" Ron picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, and bit into a corner. \"Bleaaargh - see? Sprouts.\" They had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans. Harry got toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron wouldn\\'t touch, which turned out to be pepper. The countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder. The neat fields had gone. Now there were woods, twisting rivers, and dark green hills. There was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round-faced boy Harry had passed on platform nine and three-quarters came in. He looked tearful. \"Sorry,\" he said, \"but have you seen a toad at all?\" When they shook their heads, he wailed, \"I\\'ve lost him! He keeps getting away from me!\" \"He\\'ll turn up,\" said Harry. \"Yes,\" said the boy miserably. \"Well, if you see him–\" He left. \"Don\\'t know why he\\'s so bothered,\" said Ron. \"If I\\'d brought a toad I\\'d lose it as quick as I could. Mind you, I brought Scabbers, so I can\\'t talk.\" The rat was still snoozing on Ron\\'s lap. \"He might have died and you wouldn\\'t know the difference,\" said Ron in disgust. \"I tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting, but the spell didn\\'t work. I\\'ll show you, look–\" He rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very battered-looking wand. It was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the end. \"Unicorn hair\\'s nearly poking out. Anyway - \" He had just raised his wand when the compartment door slid open again. The toadless boy was back, but this time he had a girl with him. She was already wearing her new Hogwarts robes. \"Has anyone seen a toad? Neville\\'s lost one,\" she said. She had a bossy sort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair, and rather large front teeth. \"We\\'ve already told him we haven\\'t seen it,\" said Ron, but the girl wasn\\'t listening, she was looking at the wand in his hand. \"Oh, are you doing magic? Let\\'s see it, then.\" She sat down. Ron looked taken aback. \"Er - all right.\" He cleared his throat. \"Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow.\" He waved his wand, but nothing happened. Scabbers stayed gray and fast asleep. \"Are you sure that\\'s a real spell?\" said the girl. \"Well, it\\'s not very good, is it? I\\'ve tried a few simple spells just for practice and it\\'s all worked for me. Nobody in my family\\'s magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I mean, it\\'s the very best school of witchcraft there is, I\\'ve heard - I\\'ve learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough - I\\'m Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you?\" She said all this very fast. Harry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he hadn\\'t learned all the course books by heart either. \"I\\'m Ron Weasley,\" Ron muttered. \"Harry Potter,\" said Harry. \"Are you really?\" said Hermione. \"I know all about you, of course - I got a few extra books, for background reading, and you\\'re in Modern Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century.\" \"Am I?\" said Harry, feeling dazed. \"Goodness, didn\\'t you know, I\\'d have found out everything I could if it was me,\" said Hermione. \"Do either of you know what house you\\'ll be in? I\\'ve been asking around, and I hope I\\'m in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the best; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn\\'t be too bad– Anyway, we\\'d better go and look for Neville\\'s toad. You two had better change, you know, I expect we\\'ll be there soon.\" And she left, taking the toadless boy with her. \"Whatever house I\\'m in, I hope she\\'s not in it,\" said Ron. He threw his wand back into his trunk. \"Stupid spell - George gave it to me, bet he knew it was a dud.\" \"What house are your brothers in?\" asked Harry. \"Gryffindor,\" said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again. \"Mom and Dad were in it, too. I don\\'t know what they\\'ll say if I\\'m not. I don\\'t suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin.\" \"That\\'s the house Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?\" \"Yeah,\" said Ron. He flopped back into his seat, looking depressed. \"You know, I think the ends of Scabbers\\' whiskers are a bit lighter,\" said Harry, trying to take Ron\\'s mind off houses. \"So what do your oldest brothers do now that they\\'ve left, anyway?\" Harry was wondering what a wizard did once he\\'d finished school. \"Charlie\\'s in Romania studying dragons, and Bill\\'s in Africa doing something for Gringotts,\" said Ron. \"Did you hear about Gringotts? It\\'s been all over the Daily Prophet, but I don\\'t suppose you get that with the Muggles - someone tried to rob a high security vault.\" Harry stared. \"Really? What happened to them?\" \"Nothing, that\\'s why it\\'s such big news. They haven\\'t been caught. My dad says it must\\'ve been a powerful Dark wizard to get round Gringotts, but they don\\'t think they took anything, that\\'s what\\'s odd. \\'Course, everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case You-Know-Who\\'s behind it.\" Harry turned this news over in his mind. He was starting to get a prickle of fear every time You-Know-Who was mentioned. He supposed this was all part of entering the magical world, but it had been a lot more comfortable saying \"Voldemort\" without worrying. \"What\\'s your Quidditch team?\" Ron asked. \"Er - I don\\'t know any.\" Harry confessed. \"What!\" Ron looked dumbfounded. \"Oh, you wait, it\\'s the best game in the world - \" And he was off, explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven players, describing famous games he\\'d been to with his brothers and the broomstick he\\'d like to get if he had the money. He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn\\'t Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this time. Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: it was the pale boy from Madam Malkin\\'s robe shop. He was looking at Harry with a lot more interest than he\\'d shown back in Diagon Alley. \"Is it true?\" he said. \"They\\'re saying all down the train that Harry Potter\\'s in this compartment. So it\\'s you, is it?\" \"Yes,\" said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of them were thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either side of the pale boy, they looked like bodyguards. \"Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,\" said the pale boy carelessly, noticing where Harry was looking. \"And my name\\'s Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.\" Ron gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigger. Draco Malfoy looked at him. \"Think my name\\'s funny, do you? No need to ask who you are. My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than they can afford.\" He turned back to Harry. \"You\\'ll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don\\'t want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.\" He held out his hand to shake Harry\\'s, but Harry didn\\'t take it. \"I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks,\" he said coolly. Draco Malfoy didn\\'t go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks. \"I\\'d be careful if I were you, Potter,\" he said slowly. \"Unless you\\'re a bit politer you\\'ll go the same way as your parents. They didn\\'t know what was good for them, either. You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it\\'ll rub off on you.\" Both Harry and Ron stood up. \"Say that again,\" Ron said, his face as red as his hair. \"Oh, you\\'re going to fight us, are you?\" Malfoy sneered. \"Unless you get out now,\" said Harry, more bravely than he felt, because Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or Ron. \"But we don\\'t feet like leaving, do we, boys? We\\'ve eaten all our food and you still seem to have some.\" Goyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron - Ron leapt forward, but before he\\'d so much as touched Goyle, Goyle let out a horrible yell. Scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp little teeth sunk deep into Goyle\\'s knuckle - Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung Scabbers round and round, howling, and when Scabbers finally flew off and hit the window, all three of them disappeared at once. Perhaps they thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps they\\'d heard footsteps, because a second later, Hermione Granger had come in. \"What has been going on?\" she said, looking at the sweets all over the floor and Ron picking up Scabbers by his tail. \"I think he\\'s been knocked out,\" Ron said to Harry. He looked closer at Scabbers. \"No - I don\\'t believe it - he\\'s gone back to sleep.\" And so he had. \"You\\'ve met Malfoy before?\" Harry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley. \"I\\'ve heard of his family,\" said Ron darkly. \"They were some of the first to come back to our side after You-Know-Who disappeared. Said they\\'d been bewitched. My dad doesn\\'t believe it. He says Malfoy\\'s father didn\\'t need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side.\" He turned to Hermione. \"Can we help you with something?\" \"You\\'d better hurry up and put your robes on, I\\'ve just been up to the front to ask the conductor, and he says we\\'re nearly there. You haven\\'t been fighting, have you? You\\'ll be in trouble before we even get there!\" \"Scabbers has been fighting, not us,\" said Ron, scowling at her. \"Would you mind leaving while we change?\" \"All right - I only came in here because people outside are behaving very childishly, racing up and down the corridors,\" said Hermione in a sniffy voice. \"And you\\'ve got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you know?\" Ron glared at her as she left. Harry peered out of the window. It was getting dark. He could see mountains and forests under a deep purple sky. The train did seem to be slowing down. He and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes. Ron\\'s were a bit short for him, you could see his sneakers underneath them. A voice echoed through the train: \"We will be reaching Hogwarts in five minutes\\' time. Please leave your luggage on the train, it will be taken to the school separately.\" Harry\\'s stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, he saw, looked pale under his freckles. They crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined the crowd thronging the corridor. The train slowed right down and finally stopped. People pushed their way toward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform. Harry shivered in the cold night air. Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students, and Harry heard a familiar voice: \"Firs\\' years! Firs\\' years over here! All right there, Harry?\" Hagrid\\'s big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads. \"C\\'mon, follow me - any more firs\\' years? Mind yer step, now! Firs\\' years follow me!\" Slipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down what seemed to be a steep, narrow path. It was so dark on either side of them that Harry thought there must be thick trees there. Nobody spoke much. Neville, the boy who kept losing his toad, sniffed once or twice. \"Yeh\\'ll get yer firs\\' sight o\\' Hogwarts in a sec,\" Hagrid called over his shoulder, \"jus\\' round this bend here.\" There was a loud \"Oooooh!\" The narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black lake. Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers. \"No more\\'n four to a boat!\" Hagrid called, pointing to a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore. Harry and Ron were followed into their boat by Neville and Hermione. \"Everyone in?\" shouted Hagrid, who had a boat to himself. \"Right then - FORWARD!\" And the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, gliding across the lake, which was as smooth as glass. Everyone was silent, staring up at the great castle overhead. It towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood. \"Heads down!\" yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff; they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face. They were carried along a dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle, until they reached a kind of underground harbor, where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles. \"Oy, you there! Is this your toad?\" said Hagrid, who was checking the boats as people climbed out of them. \"Trevor!\" cried Neville blissfully, holding out his hands. Then they clambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrid\\'s lamp, coming out at last onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle. They walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge, oak front door. \"Everyone here? You there, still got yer toad?\" Hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle door. CHAPTER SEVEN The Sorting Hat The door swung open at once. A tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green robes stood there. She had a very stern face and Harry\\'s first thought was that this was not someone to cross. \"The firs\\' years, Professor McGonagall,\" said Hagrid. \"Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here.\" She pulled the door wide. The entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the Dursleys\\' house in it. The stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors. They followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor. Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right - the rest of the school must already be here - but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in, standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering about nervously. \"Welcome to Hogwarts,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your house, sleep in your house dormitory, and spend free time in your house common room. \"The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your house points, while any rulebreaking will lose house points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours. \"The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting.\" Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville\\'s cloak, which was fastened under his left ear, and on Ron\\'s smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to flatten his hair. \"I shall return when we are ready for you,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"Please wait quietly.\" She left the chamber. Harry swallowed. \"How exactly do they sort us into houses?\" he asked Ron. \"Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he was joking.\" Harry\\'s heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of the whole school? But he didn\\'t know any magic yet - what on earth would he have to do? He hadn\\'t expected something like this the moment they arrived. He looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified, too. No one was talking much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering very fast about all the spells she\\'d learned and wondering which one she\\'d need. Harry tried hard not to listen to her. He\\'d never been more nervous, never, not even when he\\'d had to take a school report home to the Dursleys saying that he\\'d somehow turned his teacher\\'s wig blue. He kept his eyes fixed on the door. Any second now, Professor McGonagall would come back and lead him to his doom. Then something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air - several people behind him screamed. \"What the - ?\" He gasped. So did the people around him. About twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back wall. Pearly-white and slightly transparent, they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years. They seemed to be arguing. What looked like a fat little monk was saying: \"Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give him a second chance - \" \"My dear Friar, haven\\'t we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He gives us all a bad name and you know, he\\'s not really even a ghost - I say, what are you all doing here?\" A ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years. Nobody answered. \"New students!\" said the Fat Friar, smiling around at them. \"About to be Sorted, I suppose?\" A few people nodded mutely. \"Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!\" said the Friar. \"My old house, you know.\" \"Move along now,\" said a sharp voice. \"The Sorting Ceremony\\'s about to start.\" Professor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall. \"Now, form a line,\" Professor McGonagall told the first years, \"and follow me.\" Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall. Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place. It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting. These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets. At the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting. Professor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them. The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among the students, the ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. He heard Hermione whisper, \"Its bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read about it in Hogwarts, A History.\" It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the Great Hall didn\\'t simply open on to the heavens. Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed a four-legged stool in front of the first years. On top of the stool she put a pointed wizard\\'s hat. This hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn\\'t have let it in the house. Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing - noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there was complete silence. Then the hat twitched. A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth - and the hat began to sing: \"Oh, you may not think I\\'m pretty, But don\\'t judge on what you see, I\\'ll eat myself if you can find A smarter hat than me. You can keep your bowlers black, Your top hats sleek and tall, For I\\'m the Hogwarts Sorting Hat And I can cap them all. There\\'s nothing hidden in your head The Sorting Hat can\\'t see, So try me on and I will tell you Where you ought to be. You might belong in Gryffindor, Where dwell the brave at heart, Their daring, nerve, and chivalry Set Gryffindors apart; You might belong in Hufflepuff, Where they are just and loyal, Those patient Hufflepuffs are true And unafraid of toil; Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw, if you\\'ve a ready mind, Where those of wit and learning, Will always find their kind; Or perhaps in Slytherin You\\'ll make your real friends, Those cunning folk use any means To achieve their ends. So put me on! Don\\'t be afraid! And don\\'t get in a flap! You\\'re in safe hands (though I have none) For I\\'m a Thinking Cap!\" The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song. It bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again. \"So we\\'ve just got to try on the hat!\" Ron whispered to Harry. \"I\\'ll kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll.\" Harry smiled weakly. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching. The hat seemed to be asking rather a lot; Harry didn\\'t feel brave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment. If only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for him. Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment. \"When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted,\" she said. \"Abbott, Hannah!\" A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the hat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down. A moments pause - \"HUFFLEPUFF!\" shouted the hat. The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table. Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at her. \"Bones, Susan!\" \"HUFFLEPUFF!\" shouted the hat again, and Susan scuttled off to sit next to Hannah. \"Boot, Terry!\" \"RAVENCLAW!\" The table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them. \"Brocklehurst, Mandy\" went to Ravenclaw too, but \"Brown, Lavender\" became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; Harry could see Ron\\'s twin brothers catcalling. \"Bulstrode, Millicent\" then became a Slytherin. Perhaps it was Harry\\'s imagination, after all he\\'d heard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot. He was starting to feel definitely sick now. He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school. He had always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him. \"Finch-Fletchley, Justin!\" \"HUFFLEPUFF!\" Sometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the house at once, but at others it took a little while to decide. \"Finnigan, Seamus,\" the sandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor. \"Granger, Hermione!\" Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head. \"GRYFFINDOR!\" shouted the hat. Ron groaned. A horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do when you\\'re very nervous. What if he wasn\\'t chosen at all? What if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and he\\'d better get back on the train? When Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his toad, was called, he fell over on his way to the stool. The hat took a long time to decide with Neville. When it finally shouted, \"GRYFFINDOR,\" Neville ran off still wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to \"MacDougal, Morag.\" Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed, \"SLYTHERIN!\" Malfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with himself. There weren\\'t many people left now. \"Moon\"– , \"Nott\"– , \"Parkinson\"– , then a pair of twin girls, \"Patil\" and \"Patil\"– , then \"Perks, Sally-Anne\"– , and then, at last - \"Potter, Harry!\" As Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall. \"Potter, did she say?\" \"The Harry Potter?\" The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat. He waited. \"Hmm,\" said a small voice in his ear. \"Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There\\'s talent, A my goodness, yes - and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that\\'s interesting– So where shall I put you?\" Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not Slytherin. \"Not Slytherin, eh?\" said the small voice. \"Are you sure? You could be great, you know, it\\'s all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that - no? Well, if you\\'re sure - better be GRYFFINDOR!\" Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall. He took off the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table. He was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, \"We got Potter! We got Potter!\" Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff he\\'d seen earlier. The ghost patted his arm, giving Harry the sudden, horrible feeling he\\'d just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold water. He could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest him sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up. Harry grinned back. And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at once from the card he\\'d gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train. Dumbledore\\'s silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts. Harry spotted Professor Quirrell, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban. And now there were only three people left to be sorted. \"Thomas, Dean,\" a Black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table. \"Turpin, Lisa,\" became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron\\'s turn. He was pale green by now. Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted, \"GRYFFINDOR!\" Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next to him. \"Well done, Ron, excellent,\" said Percy Weasley pompously across Harry as \"Zabini, Blaise,\" was made a Slytherin. Professor McGonagall rolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away. Harry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had only just realized how hungry he was. The pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago. Albus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was beaming at the students, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there. \"Welcome,\" he said. \"Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak! \"Thank you!\" He sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered. Harry didn\\'t know whether to laugh or not. \"Is he - a bit mad?\" he asked Percy uncertainly. \"Mad?\" said Percy airily. \"He\\'s a genius! Best wizard in the world! But he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, Harry?\" Harry\\'s mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him were now piled with food. He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint humbugs. The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he\\'d never been allowed to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted, even if It made him sick. Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat. It was all delicious. \"That does look good,\" said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching Harry cut up his steak. \"Can\\'t you - ?\" \"I haven\\'t eaten for nearly five hundred years,\" said the ghost. \"I don\\'t need to, of course, but one does miss it. I don\\'t think I\\'ve introduced myself? Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service. Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower.\" \"I know who you are!\" said Ron suddenly. \"My brothers told me about you - you\\'re Nearly Headless Nick!\" \"I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy - \" the ghost began stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted. \"Nearly Headless? How can you be nearly headless?\" Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn\\'t going at all the way he wanted. \"Like this,\" he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge. Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it properly. Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said, \"So - new Gryffindors! I hope you\\'re going to help us win the house championship this year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without winning. Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row! The Bloody Baron\\'s becoming almost unbearable - he\\'s the Slytherin ghost.\" Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood. He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to see, didn\\'t look too pleased with the seating arrangements. \"How did he get covered in blood?\" asked Seamus with great interest. \"I\\'ve never asked,\" said Nearly Headless Nick delicately. When everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the food faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as before. A moment later the desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-O, rice pudding– As Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their families. \"I\\'m half-and-half,\" said Seamus. \"Me dad\\'s a Muggle. Mom didn\\'t tell him she was a witch \\'til after they were married. Bit of a nasty shock for him.\" The others laughed. \"What about you, Neville?\" said Ron. \"Well, my gran brought me up and she\\'s a witch,\" said Neville, \"but the family thought I was all-Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me - he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned - but nothing happened until I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced - all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here - they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad.\" On Harry\\'s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons (\"I do hope they start right away, there\\'s so much to learn, I\\'m particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it\\'s supposed to be very difficult - \"; \"You\\'ll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing - \"). Harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at the High Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet. Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin. It happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher looked past Quirrell\\'s turban straight into Harry\\'s eyes - and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Harry\\'s forehead. \"Ouch!\" Harry clapped a hand to his head. \"What is it?\" asked Percy. \"N-nothing.\" The pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher\\'s look - a feeling that he didn\\'t like Harry at all. \"Who\\'s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?\" he asked Percy. \"Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he\\'s looking so nervous, that\\'s Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn\\'t want to - everyone knows he\\'s after Quirrell\\'s job. Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts, Snape.\" Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn\\'t look at him again. At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again. The hall fell silent. \"Ahem - just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you. \"First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.\" Dumbledore\\'s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins. \"I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors. \"Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch. \"And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death.\" Harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did. \"He\\'s not serious?\" he muttered to Percy. \"Must be,\" said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. \"It\\'s odd, because he usually gives us a reason why we\\'re not allowed to go somewhere - the forest\\'s full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he might have told us prefects, at least.\" \"And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!\" cried Dumbledore. Harry noticed that the other teachers\\' smiles had become rather fixed. Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words. \"Everyone pick their favorite tune,\" said Dumbledore, \"and off we go!\" And the school bellowed: \"Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts, Teach us something please, Whether we be old and bald Or young with scabby knees, Our heads could do with filling With some interesting stuff, For now they\\'re bare and full of air, Dead flies and bits of fluff, So teach us things worth knowing, Bring back what we\\'ve forgot, just do your best, we\\'ll do the rest, And learn until our brains all rot.\" Everybody finished the song at different times. At last, only the Weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march. Dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished, he was one of those who clapped loudest. \"Ah, music,\" he said, wiping his eyes. \"A magic beyond all we do here! And now, bedtime. Off you trot!\" The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase. Harry\\'s legs were like lead again, but only because he was so tired and full of food. He was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed, or that twice Percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries. They climbed more staircases, yawning and dragging their feet, and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt. A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them, and as Percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him. \"Peeves,\" Percy whispered to the first years. \"A poltergeist.\" He raised his voice, \"Peeves - show yourself.\" A loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered. \"Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?\" There was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross-legged in the air, clutching the walking sticks. \"Oooooooh!\" he said, with an evil cackle. \"Ickle Firsties! What fun!\" He swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked. \"Go away, Peeves, or the Baron\\'ll hear about this, I mean it!\" barked Percy. Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on Neville\\'s head. They heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed. \"You want to watch out for Peeves,\" said Percy, as they set off again. \"The Bloody Baron\\'s the only one who can control him, he won\\'t even listen to us prefects. Here we are.\" At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress. \"Password?\" she said. \"Caput Draconis,\" said Percy, and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall. They all scrambled through it - Neville needed a leg up - and found themselves in the Gryffindor common room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs. Percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another. At the top of a spiral staircase - they were obviously in one of the towers - they found their beds at last: five four-posters hung with deep red, velvet curtains. Their trunks had already been brought up. Too tired to talk much, they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed. \"Great food, isn\\'t it?\" Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings. \"Get off, Scabbers! He\\'s chewing my sheets.\" Harry was going to ask Ron if he\\'d had any of the treacle tart, but he fell asleep almost at once. Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very strange dream. He was wearing Professor Quirrell\\'s turban, which kept talking to him, telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was his destiny. Harry told the turban he didn\\'t want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully - and there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with it - then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold - there was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking. He rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke next day, he didn\\'t remember the dream at all. CHAPTER EIGHT The Potions Master \"There, look.\" \"Where?\" \"Next to the tall kid with the red hair.\" \"Wearing the glasses?\" \"Did you see his face?\" \"Did you see his scar?\" Whispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next day. People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring. Harry wished they wouldn\\'t, because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes. There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on a Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump. Then there were doors that wouldn\\'t open unless you asked politely, or tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors that weren\\'t really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending. It was also very hard to remember where anything was, because it all seemed to move around a lot. The people in the portraits kept going to visit each other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk. The ghosts didn\\'t help, either. It was always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open. Nearly Headless Nick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class. He would drop wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from under your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak up behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech, \"GOT YOUR CONK!\" Even worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the caretaker, Argus Filch. Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning. Filch found them trying to force their way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out-of-bounds corridor on the third floor. He wouldn\\'t believe they were lost, was sure they were trying to break into it on purpose, and was threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by Professor Quirrell, who was passing. Filch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris, a scrawny, dust-colored creature with bulging, lamp like eyes just like Filch\\'s. She patrolled the corridors alone. Break a rule in front of her, put just one toe out of line, and she\\'d whisk off for Filch, who\\'d appear, wheezing, two seconds later. Filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone (except perhaps the Weasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts. The students all hated him, and it was the dearest ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a good kick. And then, once you had managed to find them, there were the classes themselves. There was a lot more to magic, as Harry quickly found out, than waving your wand and saying a few funny words. They had to study the night skies through their telescopes every Wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements of the planets. Three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, with a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout, where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi, and found out what they were used for. Easily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was the only one taught by a ghost. Professor Binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him. Binns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates, and got Emetic the Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up. Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of their first class he took the roll call, and when he reached Harry\\'s name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight. Professor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been quite right to think she wasn\\'t a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she gave them a talking-to the moment they sat down in her first class. \"Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts,\" she said. \"Anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back. You have been warned.\" Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again. They were all very impressed and couldn\\'t wait to get started, but soon realized they weren\\'t going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time. After taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle. By the end of the lesson, only Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match; Professor McGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare smile. The class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrell\\'s lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke. His classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to ward off a vampire he\\'d met in Romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days. His turban, he told them, had been given to him by an African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie, but they weren\\'t sure they believed this story. For one thing, when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather; for another, they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went. Harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn\\'t miles behind everyone else. Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, hadn\\'t had any idea that they were witches and wizards. There was so much to learn that even people like Ron didn\\'t have much of a head start. Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They finally managed to find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost once. \"What have we got today?\" Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his porridge. \"Double Potions with the Slytherins,\" said Ron. \"Snape\\'s Head of Slytherin House. They say he always favors them - we\\'ll be able to see if it\\'s true.\" \"Wish McGonagall favored us,\" said Harry. Professor McGonagall was head of Gryffindor House, but it hadn\\'t stopped her from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before. Just then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to this by now, but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast, circling the tables until they saw their owners, and dropping letters and packages onto their laps. Hedwig hadn\\'t brought Harry anything so far. She sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls. This morning, however, she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto Harry\\'s plate. Harry tore it open at once. It said, in a very untidy scrawl: Dear Harry, I know you get Friday afternoons off, so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three? I want to hear all about your first week. Send us an answer back with Hedwig. Hagrid Harry borrowed Ron\\'s quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again. It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so far. At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor Snape disliked him. By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew he\\'d been wrong. Snape didn\\'t dislike Harry - he hated him. Potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was colder here than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls. Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like Flitwick, he paused at Harry\\'s name. \"Ah, Yes,\" he said softly, \"Harry Potter. Our new - celebrity.\" Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their hands. Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class. His eyes were black like Hagrid\\'s, but they had none of Hagrid\\'s warmth. They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels. \"You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potionmaking,\" he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word - like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort. \"As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don\\'t expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses– I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death - if you aren\\'t as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.\" More silence followed this little speech. Harry and Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows. Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasn\\'t a dunderhead. \"Potter!\" said Snape suddenly. \"What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?\" Powdered root of what to an infusion of what? Harry glanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as he was; Hermione\\'s hand had shot into the air. \"I don\\'t know, sir,\" said Harry. Snape\\'s lips curled into a sneer. \"Tut, tut - fame clearly isn\\'t everything.\" He ignored Hermione\\'s hand. \"Let\\'s try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?\" Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat, but Harry didn\\'t have the faintest idea what a bezoar was. He tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were shaking with laughter. \"I don\\'t know, sir.\" \"Thought you wouldn\\'t open a book before coming, eh, Potter?\" Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes. He had looked through his books at the Dursleys\\', but did Snape expect him to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi? Snape was still ignoring Hermione\\'s quivering hand. \"What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?\" At this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling. \"I don\\'t know,\" said Harry quietly. \"I think Hermione does, though, why don\\'t you try her?\" A few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus\\'s eye, and Seamus winked. Snape, however, was not pleased. \"Sit down,\" he snapped at Hermione. \"For your information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite. Well? Why aren\\'t you all copying that down?\" There was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment. Over the noise, Snape said, \"And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek, Potter.\" Things didn\\'t improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson continued. Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils. He swept around in his long black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, whom he seemed to like. He was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon. Neville had somehow managed to melt Seamus\\'s cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor, burning holes in people\\'s shoes. Within seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs. \"Idiot boy!\" snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand. \"I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?\" Neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose. \"Take him up to the hospital wing,\" Snape spat at Seamus. Then he rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville. \"You - Potter - why didn\\'t you tell him not to add the quills? Thought he\\'d make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? That\\'s another point you\\'ve lost for Gryffindor.\" This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron kicked him behind their cauldron. \"Don\\'t push it,\" he muttered, \"I\\'ve heard Snape can turn very nasty.\" As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry\\'s mind was racing and his spirits were low. He\\'d lost two points for Gryffindor in his very first week - why did Snape hate him so much? \"Cheer up,\" said Ron, \"Snape\\'s always taking points off Fred and George. Can I come and meet Hagrid with you?\" At five to three they left the castle and made their way across the grounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest. A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door. When Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks. Then Hagrid\\'s voice rang out, saying, \"Back, Fang - back.\" Hagrid\\'s big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open. \"Hang on,\" he said. \"Back, Fang.\" He let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound. There was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire, and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it. \"Make yerselves at home,\" said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who bounded straight at Ron and started licking his ears. Like Hagrid, Fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked. \"This is Ron,\" Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate. \"Another Weasley, eh?\" said Hagrid, glancing at Ron\\'s freckles. \"I spent half me life chasin\\' yer twin brothers away from the forest.\" The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all about their first lessons. Fang rested his head on Harry\\'s knee and drooled all over his robes. Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Filch \"that old git.\" \"An\\' as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I\\'d like ter introduce her to Fang sometime. D\\'yeh know, every time I go up ter the school, she follows me everywhere? Can\\'t get rid of her - Filch puts her up to it.\" Harry told Hagrid about Snape\\'s lesson. Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students. \"But he seemed to really hate me.\" \"Rubbish!\" said Hagrid. \"Why should he?\" Yet Harry couldn\\'t help thinking that Hagrid didn\\'t quite meet his eyes when he said that. \"How\\'s yer brother Charlie?\" Hagrid asked Ron. \"I liked him a lot - great with animals.\" Harry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose. While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie\\'s work with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy. It was a cutting from the Daily Prophet: GRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST Investigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts on 31 July, widely believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown. Gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day. \"But we\\'re not telling you what was in there, so keep your noses out if you know what\\'s good for you,\" said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon. Harry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn\\'t mentioned the date. \"Hagrid!\" said Harry, \"that Gringotts break-in happened on my birthday! It might\\'ve been happening while we were there!\" There was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn\\'t meet Harry\\'s eyes this time. He grunted and offered him another rock cake. Harry read the story again. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen, if you could call it emptying, taking out that grubby little package. Had that been what the thieves were looking for? As Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their pockets weighed down with rock cakes they\\'d been too polite to refuse, Harry thought that none of the lessons he\\'d had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with Hagrid. Had Hagrid collected that package just in time? Where was it now? And did Hagrid know something about Snape that he didn\\'t want to tell Harry? CHAPTER NINE The Midnight Duel Harry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than Dudley, but that was before he met Draco Malfoy. Still, first-year Gryffindors only had Potions with the Slytherins, so they didn\\'t have to put up with Malfoy much. Or at least, they didn\\'t until they spotted a notice pinned up in the Gryffindor common room that made them all groan. Flying lessons would be starting on Thursday - and Gryffindor and Slytherin would be learning together. \"Typical,\" said Harry darkly. \"Just what I always wanted. To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy.\" He had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else. \"You don\\'t know that you\\'ll make a fool of yourself,\" said Ron reasonably. \"Anyway, I know Malfoy\\'s always going on about how good he is at Quidditch, but I bet that\\'s all talk.\" Malfoy certainly did talk about flying a lot. He complained loudly about first years never getting on the house Quidditch teams and told long, boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping Muggles in helicopters. He wasn\\'t the only one, though: the way Seamus Finnigan told it, he\\'d spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick. Even Ron would tell anyone who\\'d listen about the time he\\'d almost hit a hang glider on Charlie\\'s old broom. Everyone from wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly. Ron had already had a big argument with Dean Thomas, who shared their dormitory, about soccer. Ron couldn\\'t see what was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly. Harry had caught Ron prodding Dean\\'s poster of West Ham soccer team, trying to make the players move. Neville had never been on a broomstick in his life, because his grandmother had never let him near one. Privately, Harry felt she\\'d had good reason, because Neville managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground. Hermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Neville was. This was something you couldn\\'t learn by heart out of a book - not that she hadn\\'t tried. At breakfast on Thursday she bored them all stupid with flying tips she\\'d gotten out of a library book called Quidditch Through the Ages. Neville was hanging on to her every word, desperate for anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later, but everybody else was very pleased when Hermione\\'s lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail. Harry hadn\\'t had a single letter since Hagrid\\'s note, something that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of course. Malfoy\\'s eagle owl was always bringing him packages of sweets from home, which he opened gloatingly at the Slytherin table. A barn owl brought Neville a small package from his grandmother. He opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke. \"It\\'s a Remembrall!\" he explained. \"Gran knows I forget things - this tells you if there\\'s something you\\'ve forgotten to do. Look, you hold it tight like this and if it turns red - oh–\" His face fell, because the Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, \"– you\\'ve forgotten something–\" Neville was trying to remember what he\\'d forgotten when Draco Malfoy, who was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Remembrall out of his hand. Harry and Ron jumped to their feet. They were half hoping for a reason to fight Malfoy, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a flash. \"What\\'s going on?\" \"Malfoy\\'s got my Remembrall, Professor.\" Scowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table. \"Just looking,\" he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle behind him. At three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson. It was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance. The Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground. Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley complain about the school brooms, saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to the left. Their teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, gray hair, and yellow eyes like a hawk. \"Well, what are you all waiting for?\" she barked. \"Everyone stand by a broomstick. Come on, hurry up.\" Harry glanced down at his broom. It was old and some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles. \"Stick out your right hand over your broom,\" called Madam Hooch at the front, \"and say ‚Up!\\'\" \"UP\" everyone shouted. Harry\\'s broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few that did. Hermione Granger\\'s had simply rolled over on the ground, and Neville\\'s hadn\\'t moved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Neville\\'s voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground. Madam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips. Harry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he\\'d been doing it wrong for years. \"Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard,\" said Madam Hooch. \"Keep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle - three - two - \" But Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hooch\\'s lips. \"Come back, boy!\" she shouted, but Neville was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle - twelve feet - twenty feet. Harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp, slip sideways off the broom and - WHAM - a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on the grass in a heap. His broomstick was still rising higher and higher, and started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight. Madam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as his. \"Broken wrist,\" Harry heard her mutter. \"Come on, boy - it\\'s all right, up you get.\" She turned to the rest of the class. \"None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are or you\\'ll be out of Hogwarts before you can say ‚Quidditch.\\' Come on, dear.\" Neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm around him. No sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into laughter. \"Did you see his face, the great lump?\" The other Slytherins joined in. \"Shut up, Malfoy,\" snapped Parvati Patil. \"Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?\" said Pansy Parkinson, a hard-faced Slytherin girl. \"Never thought you\\'d like fat little crybabies, Parvati.\" \"Look!\" said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching something out of the grass. \"It\\'s that stupid thing Longbottom\\'s gran sent him.\" The Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up. \"Give that here, Malfoy,\" said Harry quietly. Everyone stopped talking to watch. Malfoy smiled nastily. \"I think I\\'ll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find - how about - up a tree?\" \"Give it here!\" Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick and taken off. He hadn\\'t been lying, he could fly well. Hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he called, \"Come and get it, Potter!\" Harry grabbed his broom. \"No!\" shouted Hermione Granger. \"Madam Hooch told us not to move - you\\'ll get us all into trouble.\" Harry ignored her. Blood was pounding in his ears. He mounted the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared; air rushed through his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him - and in a rush of fierce joy he realized he\\'d found something he could do without being taught - this was easy, this was wonderful. He pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even higher, and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from Ron. He turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in midair. Malfoy looked stunned. \"Give it here,\" Harry called, \"or I\\'ll knock you off that broom!\" \"Oh, yeah?\" said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking worried. Harry knew, somehow, what to do. He leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands, and it shot toward Malfoy like a javelin. Malfoy only just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about-face and held the broom steady. A few people below were clapping. \"No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy,\" Harry called. The same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy. \"Catch it if you can, then!\" he shouted, and he threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the ground. Harry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air and then start to fall. He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down - next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball - wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the screams of people watching - he stretched out his hand - a foot from the ground he caught it, just in time to pull his broom straight, and he toppled gently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in his fist. \"HARRY POTTER!\" His heart sank faster than he\\'d just dived. Professor McGonagall was running toward them. He got to his feet, trembling. \"Never - in all my time at Hogwarts - \" Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and her glasses flashed furiously, \" - how dare you - might have broken your neck - \" \"It wasn\\'t his fault, Professor - \" \"Be quiet, Miss Patil - \" \"But Malfoy - \" \"That\\'s enough, Mr. Weasley. Potter, follow me, now.\" Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle\\'s triumphant faces as he left, walking numbly in Professor McGonagall\\'s wake as she strode toward the castle. He was going to be expelled, he just knew it. He wanted to say something to defend himself, but there seemed to be something wrong with his voice. Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him; he had to jog to keep up. Now he\\'d done it. He hadn\\'t even lasted two weeks. He\\'d be packing his bags in ten minutes. What would the Dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep? Up the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still Professor McGonagall didn\\'t say a word to him. She wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her. Maybe she was taking him to Dumbledore. He thought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper. Perhaps he could be Hagrid\\'s assistant. His stomach twisted as he imagined it, watching Ron and the others becoming wizards, while he stumped around the grounds carrying Hagrid\\'s bag. Professor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom. She opened the door and poked her head inside. \"Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood for a moment?\" Wood? thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane she was going to use on him? But Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth-year boy who came out of Flitwick\\'s class looking confused. \"Follow me, you two,\" said Professor McGonagall, and they marched on up the corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry. \"In here.\" Professor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty except for Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard. \"Out, Peeves!\" she barked. Peeves threw the chalk into a bin, which clanged loudly, and he swooped out cursing. Professor McGonagall slammed the door behind him and turned to face the two boys. \"Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood - I\\'ve found you a Seeker.\" Wood\\'s expression changed from puzzlement to delight. \"Are you serious, Professor?\" \"Absolutely,\" said Professor McGonagall crisply. \"The boy\\'s a natural. I\\'ve never seen anything like it. Was that your first time on a broomstick, Potter?\" Harry nodded silently. He didn\\'t have a clue what was going on, but he didn\\'t seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling started coming back to his legs. \"He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot dive,\" Professor McGonagall told Wood. \"Didn\\'t even scratch himself. Charlie Weasley couldn\\'t have done it.\" Wood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once. \"Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?\" he asked excitedly. \"Wood\\'s captain of the Gryffindor team,\" Professor McGonagall explained. \"He\\'s just the build for a Seeker, too,\" said Wood, now walking around Harry and staring at him. \"Light - speedy - we\\'ll have to get him a decent broom, Professor - a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven, I\\'d say.\" \"I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can\\'t bend the first-year rule. Heaven knows, we need a better team than last year. Flattened in that last match by Slytherin, I couldn\\'t look Severus Snape in the face for weeks–\" Professor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at Harry. \"I want to hear you\\'re training hard, Potter, or I may change my mind about punishing you.\" Then she suddenly smiled. \"Your father would have been proud,\" she said. \"He was an excellent Quidditch player himself.\" \"You\\'re joking.\" It was dinnertime. Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened when he\\'d left the grounds with Professor McGonagall. Ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he\\'d forgotten all about it. \"Seeker?\" he said. \"But first years never - you must be the youngest house player in about - \" \" - a century,\" said Harry, shoveling pie into his mouth. He felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon. \"Wood told me.\" Ron was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped at Harry. \"I start training next week,\" said Harry. \"Only don\\'t tell anyone, Wood wants to keep it a secret.\" Fred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry, and hurried over. \"Well done,\" said George in a low voice. \"Wood told us. We\\'re on the team too - Beaters.\" \"I tell you, we\\'re going to win that Quidditch cup for sure this year,\" said Fred. \"We haven\\'t won since Charlie left, but this year\\'s team is going to be brilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping when he told us.\" \"Anyway, we\\'ve got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he\\'s found a new secret passageway out of the school.\" \"Bet it\\'s that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found in our first week. See you.\" Fred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle. \"Having a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the train back to the Muggles?\" \"You\\'re a lot braver now that you\\'re back on the ground and you\\'ve got your little friends with you,\" said Harry coolly. There was of course nothing at all little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table was full of teachers, neither of them could do more than crack their knuckles and scowl. \"I\\'d take you on anytime on my own,\" said Malfoy. \"Tonight, if you want. Wizard\\'s duel. Wands only - no contact. What\\'s the matter? Never heard of a wizard\\'s duel before, I suppose?\" \"Of course he has,\" said Ron, wheeling around. \"I\\'m his second, who\\'s yours?\" Malfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up. \"Crabbe,\" he said. \"Midnight all right? We\\'ll meet you in the trophy room; that\\'s always unlocked.\" When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other. \"What is a wizard\\'s duel?\" said Harry. \"And what do you mean, you\\'re my second?\" \"Well, a second\\'s there to take over if you die,\" said Ron casually, getting started at last on his cold pie. Catching the look on Harry\\'s face, he added quickly, \"But people only die in proper duels, you know, with real wizards. The most you and Malfoy\\'ll be able to do is send sparks at each other. Neither of you knows enough magic to do any real damage. I bet he expected you to refuse, anyway.\" \"And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?\" \"Throw it away and punch him on the nose,\" Ron suggested. \"Excuse me.\" They both looked up. It was Hermione Granger. \"Can\\'t a person eat in peace in this place?\" said Ron. Hermione ignored him and spoke to Harry. \"I couldn\\'t help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying - \" \"Bet you could,\" Ron muttered. \" - and you mustn\\'t go wandering around the school at night, think of the points you\\'ll lose Gryffindor if you\\'re caught, and you\\'re bound to be. It\\'s really very selfish of you.\" \"And it\\'s really none of your business,\" said Harry. \"Good-bye,\" said Ron. All the same, it wasn\\'t what you\\'d call the perfect end to the day, Harry thought, as he lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus falling asleep (Neville wasn\\'t back from the hospital wing). Ron had spent all evening giving him advice such as \"If he tries to curse you, you\\'d better dodge it, because I can\\'t remember how to block them.\" There was a very good chance they were going to get caught by Filch or Mrs. Norris, and Harry felt he was pushing his luck, breaking another school rule today. On the other hand, Malfoy\\'s sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness - this was his big chance to beat Malfoy face-to-face. He couldn\\'t miss it. \"Half-past eleven,\" Ron muttered at last, \"we\\'d better go.\" They pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their wands, and crept across the tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor common room. A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows. They had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them, \"I can\\'t believe you\\'re going to do this, Harry.\" A lamp flickered on. It was Hermione Granger, wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown. \"You!\" said Ron furiously. \"Go back to bed!\" \"I almost told your brother,\" Hermione snapped, \"Percy - he\\'s a prefect, he\\'d put a stop to this.\" Harry couldn\\'t believe anyone could be so interfering. \"Come on,\" he said to Ron. He pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady and climbed through the hole. Hermione wasn\\'t going to give up that easily. She followed Ron through the portrait hole, hissing at them like an angry goose. \"Don\\'t you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about yourselves, I don\\'t want Slytherin to win the house cup, and you\\'ll lose all the points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching Spells.\" \"Go away.\" \"All right, but I warned you, you just remember what I said when you\\'re on the train home tomorrow, you\\'re so - \" But what they were, they didn\\'t find out. Hermione had turned to the portrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty painting. The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermione was locked out of Gryffindor tower. \"Now what am I going to do?\" she asked shrilly. \"That\\'s your problem,\" said Ron. \"We\\'ve got to go, we\\'re going to be late.\" They hadn\\'t even reached the end of the corridor when Hermione caught up with them. \"I\\'m coming with you,\" she said. \"You are not.\" \"D\\'you think I\\'m going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me? If he finds all three of us I\\'ll tell him the truth, that I was trying to stop you, and you can back me up.\" \"You\\'ve got some nerve - \" said Ron loudly. \"Shut up, both of you!\" said Harry sharply. \"I heard something.\" It was a sort of snuffling. \"Mrs. Norris?\" breathed Ron, squinting through the dark. It wasn\\'t Mrs. Norris. It was Neville. He was curled up on the floor, fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer. \"Thank goodness you found me! I\\'ve been out here for hours, I couldn\\'t remember the new password to get in to bed.\" \"Keep your voice down, Neville. The password\\'s ‚Pig snout\\' but it won\\'t help you now, the Fat Lady\\'s gone off somewhere.\" \"How\\'s your arm?\" said Harry. \"Fine,\" said Neville, showing them. \"Madam Pomfrey mended it in about a minute.\" \"Good - well, look, Neville, we\\'ve got to be somewhere, we\\'ll see you later - \" \"Don\\'t leave me!\" said Neville, scrambling to his feet, \"I don\\'t want to stay here alone, the Bloody Baron\\'s been past twice already.\" Ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and Neville. \"If either of you get us caught, I\\'ll never rest until I\\'ve learned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about, and used it on you.\" Hermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron exactly how to use the Curse of the Bogies, but Harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all forward. They flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high windows. At every turn Harry expected to run into Filch or Mrs. Norris, but they were lucky. They sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy room. Malfoy and Crabbe weren\\'t there yet. The crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught them. Cups, shields, plates, and statues winked silver and gold in the darkness. They edged along the walls, keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room. Harry took out his wand in case Malfoy leapt in and started at once. The minutes crept by. \"He\\'s late, maybe he\\'s chickened out,\" Ron whispered. Then a noise in the next room made them jump. Harry had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak - and it wasn\\'t Malfoy. \"Sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a corner.\" It was Filch speaking to Mrs. Norris. Horror-struck, Harry waved madly at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible; they scurried silently toward the door, away from Filch\\'s voice. Neville\\'s robes had barely whipped round the corner when they heard Filch enter the trophy room. \"They\\'re in here somewhere,\" they heard him mutter, \"probably hiding.\" \"This way!\" Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, they began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor. They could hear Filch getting nearer. Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run he tripped, grabbed Ron around the waist, and the pair of them toppled right into a suit of armor. The clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle. \"RUN!\" Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the gallery, not looking back to see whether Filch was following - they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in the lead, without any idea where they were or where they were going - they ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled along it and came out near their Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy room. \"I think we\\'ve lost him,\" Harry panted, leaning against the cold wall and wiping his forehead. Neville was bent double, wheezing and spluttering. \"I - told - you,\" Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest, \"I - told - you.\" \"We\\'ve got to get back to Gryffindor tower,\" said Ron, \"quickly as possible.\" \"Malfoy tricked you,\" Hermione said to Harry. \"You realize that, don\\'t you? He was never going to meet you - Filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him off.\" Harry thought she was probably right, but he wasn\\'t going to tell her that. \"Let\\'s go.\" It wasn\\'t going to be that simple. They hadn\\'t gone more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a classroom in front of them. It was Peeves. He caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight. \"Shut up, Peeves - please - you\\'ll get us thrown out.\" Peeves cackled. \"Wandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut, tut, tut. Naughty, naughty, you\\'ll get caughty.\" \"Not if you don\\'t give us away, Peeves, please.\" \"Should tell Filch, I should,\" said Peeves in a saintly voice, but his eyes glittered wickedly. \"It\\'s for your own good, you know.\" \"Get out of the way,\" snapped Ron, taking a swipe at Peeves this was a big mistake. \"STUDENTS OUT OF BED!\" Peeves bellowed, \"STUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR!\" Ducking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a door - and it was locked. \"This is it!\" Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door, \"We\\'re done for! This is the end!\" They could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as he could toward Peeves\\'s shouts. \"Oh, move over,\" Hermione snarled. She grabbed Harry\\'s wand, tapped the lock, and whispered, \"Alohomora!\" The lock clicked and the door swung open - they piled through it, shut it quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening. \"Which way did they go, Peeves?\" Filch was saying. \"Quick, tell me.\" \"Say ‚please.\\'\" \"Don\\'t mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?\" \"Shan\\'t say nothing if you don\\'t say please,\" said Peeves in his annoying singsong voice. \"All right - please.\" \"NOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn\\'t say nothing if you didn\\'t say please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!\" And they heard the sound of Peeves whooshing away and Filch cursing in rage. \"He thinks this door is locked,\" Harry whispered. \"I think we\\'ll be okay - get off, Neville!\" For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of Harry\\'s bathrobe for the last minute. \"What?\" Harry turned around - and saw, quite clearly, what. For a moment, he was sure he\\'d walked into a nightmare - this was too much, on top of everything that had happened so far. They weren\\'t in a room, as he had supposed. They were in a corridor. The forbidden corridor on the third floor. And now they knew why it was forbidden. They were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had three heads. Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs. It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry knew that the only reason they weren\\'t already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant. Harry groped for the doorknob - between Filch and death, he\\'d take Filch. They fell backward - Harry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they almost flew, back down the corridor. Filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else, because they didn\\'t see him anywhere, but they hardly cared - all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them and that monster. They didn\\'t stop running until they reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor. \"Where on earth have you all been?\" she asked, looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces. \"Never mind that - pig snout, pig snout,\" panted Harry, and the portrait swung forward. They scrambled into the common room and collapsed, trembling, into armchairs. It was a while before any of them said anything. Neville, indeed, looked as if he\\'d never speak again. \"What do they think they\\'re doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school?\" said Ron finally. \"If any dog needs exercise, that one does.\" Hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again. \"You don\\'t use your eyes, any of you, do you?\" she snapped. \"Didn\\'t you see what it was standing on?\" \"The floor?\" Harry suggested. \"I wasn\\'t looking at its feet, I was too busy with its heads.\" \"No, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It\\'s obviously guarding something.\" She stood up, glaring at them. \"I hope you\\'re pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed - or worse, expelled. Now, if you don\\'t mind, I\\'m going to bed.\" Ron stared after her, his mouth open. \"No, we don\\'t mind,\" he said. \"You\\'d think we dragged her along, wouldn\\'t you.\" But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed back into bed. The dog was guarding something– What had Hagrid said? Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide - except perhaps Hogwarts. It looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby little package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was. CHAPTER TEN Halloween Malfoy couldn\\'t believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful. Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection. \"It\\'s either really valuable or really dangerous,\" said Ron. \"Or both,\" said Harry. But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long, they didn\\'t have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues. Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going near the dog again. Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus. All they really wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later. As the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyone\\'s attention was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech owls. Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel, and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him, knocking his bacon to the floor. They had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel. Harry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it said: DO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE. It contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I don\\'t want everybody knowing you\\'ve got a broomstick or they\\'ll all want one. Oliver Wood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o\\'clock for your first training session. Professor McGonagall Harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron to read. \"A Nimbus Two Thousand!\" Ron moaned enviously. \"I\\'ve never even touched one.\" They left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private before their first class, but halfway across the entrance hall they found the way upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy seized the package from Harry and felt it. \"That\\'s a broomstick,\" he said, throwing it back to Harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face. \"You\\'ll be in for it this time, Potter, first years aren\\'t allowed them.\" Ron couldn\\'t resist it. \"It\\'s not any old broomstick,\" he said, \"it\\'s a Nimbus Two Thousand. What did you say you\\'ve got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?\" Ron grinned at Harry. \"Comets look flashy, but they\\'re not in the same league as the Nimbus.\" \"What would you know about it, Weasley, you couldn\\'t afford half the handle,\" Malfoy snapped back. \"I suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig.\" Before Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at Malfoy\\'s elbow. \"Not arguing, I hope, boys?\" he squeaked. \"Potter\\'s been sent a broomstick, Professor,\" said Malfoy quickly. \"Yes, yes, that\\'s right,\" said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Harry. \"Professor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances, Potter. And what model is it?\" \"A Nimbus Two Thousand, it is,\" said Harry, fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on Malfoy\\'s face. \"And it\\'s really thanks to Malfoy here that I\\'ve got it,\" he added. Harry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at Malfoy\\'s obvious rage and confusion. \"Well, it\\'s true,\" Harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase, \"If he hadn\\'t stolen Neville\\'s Remembrall I wouldn\\'t be on the team–\" \"So I suppose you think that\\'s a reward for breaking rules?\" came an angry voice from just behind them. Hermione was stomping up the stairs, looking disapprovingly at the package in Harry\\'s hand. \"I thought you weren\\'t speaking to us?\" said Harry. \"Yes, don\\'t stop now,\" said Ron, \"it\\'s doing us so much good.\" Hermione marched away with her nose in the air. Harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day. It kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he\\'d be learning to play that night. He bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap the Nimbus Two Thousand at last. \"Wow,\" Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry\\'s bedspread. Even Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it looked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold near the top. As seven o\\'clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the Quidditch field. Held never been inside the stadium before. Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on. At either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end. They reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high. Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground. What a feeling - he swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field. The Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch. \"Hey, Potter, come down!\" Oliver Wood had arrived. He was carrying a large wooden crate under his arm. Harry landed next to him. \"Very nice,\" said Wood, his eyes glinting. \"I see what McGonagall meant– you really are a natural. I\\'m just going to teach you the rules this evening, then you\\'ll be joining team practice three times a week.\" He opened the crate. Inside were four different-sized balls. \"Right,\" said Wood. \"Now, Quidditch is easy enough to understand, even if it\\'s not too easy to play. There are seven players on each side. Three of them are called Chasers.\" \"Three Chasers,\" Harry repeated, as Wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball. \"This ball\\'s called the Quaffle,\" said Wood. \"The Chasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal. Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the hoops. Follow me?\" \"The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score,\" Harry recited. \"So - that\\'s sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops, isn\\'t it?\" \"What\\'s basketball?\" said Wood curiously. \"Never mind,\" said Harry quickly. \"Now, there\\'s another player on each side who\\'s called the Keeper - I\\'m Keeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring.\" \"Three Chasers, one Keeper,\" said Harry, who was determined to remember it all. \"And they play with the Quaffle. Okay, got that. So what are they for?\" He pointed at the three balls left inside the box. \"I\\'ll show you now,\" said Wood. \"Take this.\" He handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat. \"I\\'m going to show you what the Bludgers do,\" Wood said. \"These two are the Bludgers.\" He showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than the red Quaffle. Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding them inside the box. \"Stand back,\" Wood warned Harry. He bent down and freed one of the Bludgers. At once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at Harry\\'s face. Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose, and sent it zigzagging away into the air - it zoomed around their heads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground. \"See?\" Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger back into the crate and strapping it down safely. \"The Bludgers rocket around, trying to knock players off their brooms. That\\'s why you have two Beaters on each team - the Weasley twins are ours - it\\'s their job to protect their side from the Bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team. So - think you\\'ve got all that?\" \"Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper guards the goal posts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team,\" Harry reeled off. \"Very good,\" said Wood. \"Er - have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?\" Harry asked, hoping he sounded offhand. \"Never at Hogwarts. We\\'ve had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that. Now, the last member of the team is the Seeker. That\\'s you. And you don\\'t have to worry about the Quaffle or the Bludgers - \" \" - unless they crack my head open.\" \"Don\\'t worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers - I mean, they\\'re like a pair of human Bludgers themselves.\" Wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball. Compared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers, it was tiny, about the size of a large walnut. It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings. \"This,\" said Wood, \"is the Golden Snitch, and it\\'s the most important ball of the lot. It\\'s very hard to catch because it\\'s so fast and difficult to see. It\\'s the Seeker\\'s job to catch it. You\\'ve got to weave in and out of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it before the other team\\'s Seeker, because whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points, so they nearly always win. That\\'s why Seekers get fouled so much. A game of Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages - I think the record is three months, they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep. \"Well, that\\'s it any questions?\" Harry shook his head. He understood what he had to do all right, it was doing it that was going to be the problem. \"We won\\'t practice with the Snitch yet,\" said Wood, carefully shutting it back inside the crate, \"it\\'s too dark, we might lose it. Let\\'s try you out with a few of these.\" He pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few minutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch. Harry didn\\'t miss a single one, and Wood was delighted. After half an hour, night had really fallen and they couldn\\'t carry on. \"That Quidditch Cup\\'ll have our name on it this year,\" said Wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle. \"I wouldn\\'t be surprised if you turn out better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for England if he hadn\\'t gone off chasing dragons.\" Perhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework, but Harry could hardly believe it when he realized that he\\'d already been at Hogwarts two months. The castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had. His lessons, too, were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics. On Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick announced in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly, something they had all been dying to try since they\\'d seen him make Neville\\'s toad zoom around the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the class into pairs to practice. Harry\\'s partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because Neville had been trying to catch his eye). Ron, however, was to be working with Hermione Granger. It was hard to tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this. She hadn\\'t spoken to either of them since the day Harry\\'s broomstick had arrived. \"Now, don\\'t forget that nice wrist movement we\\'ve been practicing!\" squeaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile of books as usual. \"Swish and flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the magic words properly is very important, too - never forget Wizard Baruffio, who said ‚s\\' instead of ‚f\\' and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest.\" It was very difficult. Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop. Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it - Harry had to put it out with his hat. Ron, at the next table, wasn\\'t having much more luck. \"Wingardium Leviosa!\" he shouted, waving his long arms like a windmill. \"You\\'re saying it wrong,\" Harry heard Hermione snap. \"It\\'s Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the ‚gar\\' nice and long.\" \"You do it, then, if you\\'re so clever,\" Ron snarled. Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said, \"Wingardium Leviosa!\" Their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their heads. \"Oh, well done!\" cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. \"Everyone see here, Miss Granger\\'s done it!\" Ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class. \"It\\'s no wonder no one can stand her,\" he said to Harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor, \"she\\'s a nightmare, honestly.\" Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him. It was Hermione. Harry caught a glimpse of her face - and was startled to see that she was in tears. \"I think she heard you.\" \"So?\" said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. \"She must\\'ve noticed she\\'s got no friends.\" Hermione didn\\'t turn up for the next class and wasn\\'t seen all afternoon. On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls\\' bathroom and wanted to be left alone. Ron looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later they had entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of their minds. A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the candles in the pumpkins stutter. The feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates, as it had at the start-of-term banquet. Harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror on his face. Everyone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore\\'s chair, slumped against the table, and gasped, \"Troll - in the dungeons - thought you ought to know.\" He then sank to the floor in a dead faint. There was an uproar. It took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of Professor Dumbledore\\'s wand to bring silence. \"Prefects,\" he rumbled, \"lead your Houses back to the dormitories immediately!\" Percy was in his element. \"Follow me! Stick together, first years! No need to fear the troll if you follow my orders! Stay close behind me, now. Make way, first years coming through! Excuse me, I\\'m a prefect!\" \"How could a troll get in?\" Harry asked as they climbed the stairs. \"Don\\'t ask me, they\\'re supposed to be really stupid,\" said Ron. \"Maybe Peeves let it in for a Halloween joke.\" They passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions. As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry suddenly grabbed Ron\\'s arm. \"I\\'ve just thought - Hermione.\" \"What about her?\" \"She doesn\\'t know about the troll.\" Ron bit his lip. \"Oh, all right,\" he snapped. \"But Percy\\'d better not see us.\" Ducking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way, slipped down a deserted side corridor, and hurried off toward the girls\\' bathroom. They had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them. \"Percy!\" hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin. Peering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape. He crossed the corridor and disappeared from view. \"What\\'s he doing?\" Harry whispered. \"Why isn\\'t he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers?\" \"Search me.\" Quietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor after Snape\\'s fading footsteps. \"He\\'s heading for the third floor,\" Harry said, but Ron held up his hand. \"Can you smell something?\" Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean. And then they heard it - a low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet. Ron pointed - at the end of a passage to the left, something huge was moving toward them. They shrank into the shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight. It was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, granite gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat, horny feet. The smell coming from it was incredible. It was holding a huge wooden club, which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long. The troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside. It waggled its long ears, making up its tiny mind, then slouched slowly into the room. \"The keys in the lock,\" Harry muttered. \"We could lock it in.\" \"Good idea,\" said Ron nervously. They edged toward the open door, mouths dry, praying the troll wasn\\'t about to come out of it. With one great leap, Harry managed to grab the key, slam the door, and lock it. \"Yes!\" Flushed with their victory, they started to run back up the passage, but as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stop - a high, petrified scream - and it was coming from the chamber they\\'d just chained up. \"Oh, no,\" said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron. \"It\\'s the girls\\' bathroom!\" Harry gasped. \"Hermione!\" they said together. It was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did they have? Wheeling around, they sprinted back to the door and turned the key, fumbling in their panic. Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside. Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if she was about to faint. The troll was advancing on her, knocking the sinks off the walls as it went. \"Confuse it!\" Harry said desperately to Ron, and, seizing a tap, he threw it as hard as he could against the wall. The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione. It lumbered around, blinking stupidly, to see what had made the noise. Its mean little eyes saw Harry. It hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club as it went. \"Oy, pea-brain!\" yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber, and he threw a metal pipe at it. The troll didn\\'t even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, turning its ugly snout toward Ron instead, giving Harry time to run around it. \"Come on, run, run!\" Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull her toward the door, but she couldn\\'t move, she was still flat against the wall, her mouth open with terror. The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk. It roared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest and had no way to escape. Harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid: He took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the troll\\'s neck from behind. The troll couldn\\'t feel Harry hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose, and Harry\\'s wand had still been in his hand when he\\'d jumped Œ it had gone straight up one of the troll\\'s nostrils. Howling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its club, with Harry clinging on for dear life; any second, the troll was going to rip him off or catch him a terrible blow with the club. Hermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out his own wand - not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head: \"Wingardium Leviosa!\" The club flew suddenly out of the troll\\'s hand, rose high, high up into the air, turned slowly over - and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto its owner\\'s head. The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face, with a thud that made the whole room tremble. Harry got to his feet. He was shaking and out of breath. Ron was standing there with his wand still raised, staring at what he had done. It was Hermione who spoke first. \"Is it - dead?\" \"I don\\'t think so,\" said Harry, \"I think it\\'s just been knocked out.\" He bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll\\'s nose. It was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue. \"Urgh - troll boogers.\" He wiped it on the troll\\'s trousers. A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up. They hadn\\'t realized what a racket they had been making, but of course, someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll\\'s roars. A moment later, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room, closely followed by Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear. Quirrell took one look at the troll, let out a faint whimper, and sat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart. Snape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron and Harry. Harry had never seen her look so angry. Her lips were white. Hopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry\\'s mind. \"What on earth were you thinking of?\" said Professor McGonagall, with cold fury in her voice. Harry looked at Ron, who was still standing with his wand in the air. \"You\\'re lucky you weren\\'t killed. Why aren\\'t you in your dormitory?\" Snape gave Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry looked at the floor. He wished Ron would put his wand down. Then a small voice came out of the shadows. \"Please, Professor McGonagall - they were looking for me.\" \"Miss Granger!\" Hermione had managed to get to her feet at last. \"I went looking for the troll because I - I thought I could deal with it on my own - you know, because I\\'ve read all about them.\" Ron dropped his wand. Hermione Granger, telling a downright lie to a teacher? \"If they hadn\\'t found me, I\\'d be dead now. Harry stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club. They didn\\'t have time to come and fetch anyone. It was about to finish me off when they arrived.\" Harry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasn\\'t new to them. \"Well - in that case–\" said Professor McGonagall, staring at the three of them, \"Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own?\" Hermione hung her head. Harry was speechless. Hermione was the last person to do anything against the rules, and here she was, pretending she had, to get them out of trouble. It was as if Snape had started handing out sweets. \"Miss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"I\\'m very disappointed in you. If you\\'re not hurt at all, you\\'d better get off to Gryffindor tower. Students are finishing the feast in their houses.\" Hermione left. Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron. \"Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many first years could have taken on a full-grown mountain troll. You each win Gryffindor five points. Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this. You may go.\" They hurried out of the chamber and didn\\'t speak at all until they had climbed two floors up. It was a relief to be away from the smell of the troll, quite apart from anything else. \"We should have gotten more than ten points,\" Ron grumbled. \"Five, you mean, once she\\'s taken off Hermione\\'s.\" \"Good of her to get us out of trouble like that,\" Ron admitted. \"Mind you, we did save her.\" \"She might not have needed saving if we hadn\\'t locked the thing in with her,\" Harry reminded him. They had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady. \"Pig snout,\" they said and entered. The common room was packed and noisy. Everyone was eating the food that had been sent up. Hermione, however, stood alone by the door, waiting for them. There was a very embarrassed pause. Then, none of them looking at each other, they all said \"Thanks,\" and hurried off to get plates. But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are some things you can\\'t share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them. CHAPTER ELEVEN Quidditch As they entered November, the weather turned very cold. The mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel. Every morning the ground was covered in frost. Hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin boots. The Quidditch season had begun. On Saturday, Harry would be playing in his first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin. If Gryffindor won, they would move up into second place in the house championship. Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that, as their secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret. But the news that he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry didn\\'t know which was worse - people telling him he\\'d be brilliant or people telling him they\\'d be running around underneath him holding a mattress. It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermione as a friend. He didn\\'t know how he\\'d have gotten through all his homework without her, what with all the last-minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them do. She had also lent him Quidditch Through the Ages, which turned out to be a very interesting read. Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup match in 1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players, and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them; that although people rarely died playing Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert. Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer for it. The day before Harry\\'s first Quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break, and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar. They were standing with their backs to it, getting warm, when Snape crossed the yard. Harry noticed at once that Snape was limping. Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view; they were sure it wouldn\\'t be allowed. Unfortunately, something about their guilty faces caught Snape\\'s eye. He limped over. He hadn\\'t seen the fire, but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off anyway. \"What\\'s that you\\'ve got there, Potter?\" It was Quidditch Through the Ages. Harry showed him. \"Library books are not to be taken outside the school,\" said Snape. \"Give it to me. Five points from Gryffindor.\" \"He\\'s just made that rule up,\" Harry muttered angrily as Snape limped away. \"Wonder what\\'s wrong with his leg?\" \"Dunno, but I hope it\\'s really hurting him,\" said Ron bitterly. The Gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat together next to a window. Hermione was checking Harry and Ron\\'s Charms homework for them. She would never let them copy (\"How will you learn?\"), but by asking her to read it through, they got the right answers anyway. Harry felt restless. He wanted Quidditch Through the Ages back, to take his mind off his nerves about tomorrow. Why should he be afraid of Snape? Getting up, he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask Snape if he could have it. \"Better you than me,\" they said together, but Harry had an idea that Snape wouldn\\'t refuse if there were other teachers listening. He made his way down to the staffroom and knocked. There was no answer. He knocked again. Nothing. Perhaps Snape had left the book in there? It was worth a try. He pushed the door ajar and peered inside Œ and a horrible scene met his eyes. Snape and Filch were inside, alone. Snape was holding his robes above his knees. One of his legs was bloody and mangled. Filch was handing Snape bandages. \"Blasted thing,\" Snape was saying. \"How are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once?\" Harry tried to shut the door quietly, but - \"POTTER!\" Snape\\'s face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes quickly to hide his leg. Harry gulped. \"I just wondered if I could have my book back.\" \"GET OUT! OUT! \" Harry left, before Snape could take any more points from Gryffindor. He sprinted back upstairs. \"Did you get it?\" Ron asked as Harry joined them. \"What\\'s the matter?\" In a low whisper, Harry told them what he\\'d seen. \"You know what this means?\" he finished breathlessly. \"He tried to get past that three-headed dog at Halloween! That\\'s where he was going when we saw him - he\\'s after whatever it\\'s guarding! And I\\'d bet my broomstick he let that troll in, to make a diversion!\" Hermione\\'s eyes were wide. \"No - he wouldn\\'t,\" she said. \"I know he\\'s not very nice, but he wouldn\\'t try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe.\" \"Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints or something,\" snapped Ron. \"I\\'m with Harry. I wouldn\\'t put anything past Snape. But what\\'s he after? What\\'s that dog guarding?\" Harry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same question. Neville was snoring loudly, but Harry couldn\\'t sleep. He tried to empty his mind - he needed to sleep, he had to, he had his first Quidditch match in a few hours Œ but the expression on Snape\\'s face when Harry had seen his leg wasn\\'t easy to forget. The next morning dawned very bright and cold. The Great Hall was full of the delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheerful chatter of everyone looking forward to a good Quidditch match. \"You\\'ve got to eat some breakfast.\" \"I don\\'t want anything.\" \"Just a bit of toast,\" wheedled Hermione. \"I\\'m not hungry.\" Harry felt terrible. In an hour\\'s time he\\'d be walking onto the field. \"Harry, you need your strength,\" said Seamus Finnigan. \"Seekers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other team.\" \"Thanks, Seamus,\" said Harry, watching Seamus pile ketchup on his sausages. By eleven o\\'clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around the Quidditch pitch. Many students had binoculars. The seats might be raised high in the air, but it was still difficult to see what was going on sometimes. Ron and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, and Dean the West Ham fan up in the top row. As a surprise for Harry, they had painted a large banner on one of the sheets Scabbers had ruined. It said Potter for President, and Dean, who was good at drawing, had done a large Gryffindor lion underneath. Then Hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed different colors. Meanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the rest of the team were changing into their scarlet Quidditch robes (Slytherin would be playing in green). Wood cleared his throat for silence. \"Okay, men,\" he said. \"And women,\" said Chaser Angelina Johnson. \"And women,\" Wood agreed. \"This is it.\" \"The big one,\" said Fred Weasley. \"The one we\\'ve all been waiting for,\" said George. \"We know Oliver\\'s speech by heart,\" Fred told Harry, \"we were on the team last year.\" \"Shut up, you two,\" said Wood. \"This is the best team Gryffindor\\'s had in years. We\\'re going to win. I know it.\" He glared at them all as if to say, \"Or else.\" \"Right. It\\'s time. Good luck, all of you.\" Harry followed Fred and George out of the locker room and, hoping his knees weren\\'t going to give way, walked onto the field to loud cheers. Madam Hooch was refereeing. She stood in the middle of the field waiting for the two teams, her broom in her hand. \"Now, I want a nice fair game, all of you,\" she said, once they were all gathered around her. Harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the Slytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a sixth year. Harry thought Flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him. Out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above, flashing Potter for President over the crowd. His heart skipped. He felt braver. \"Mount your brooms, please.\" Harry clambered onto his Nimbus Two Thousand. Madam Hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle. Fifteen brooms rose up, high, high into the air. They were off. \"And the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Johnson of Gryffindor - what an excellent Chaser that girl is, and rather attractive, too - \" \"JORDAN!\" \"Sorry, Professor.\" The Weasley twins\\' friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the commentary for the match, closely watched by Professor McGonagall. \"And she\\'s really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood\\'s, last year only a reserve - back to Johnson and - no, the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain Marcus Flint gains the Quaffle and off he goes - Flint flying like an eagle up there - he\\'s going to sc - no, stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle - that\\'s Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive around Flint, off up the field and - OUCH - that must have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a Bludger - Quaffle taken by the Slytherins - that\\'s Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but he\\'s blocked by a second Bludger - sent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can\\'t tell which - nice play by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Johnson back in possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and off she goes - she\\'s really flying - dodges a speeding Bludger - the goal posts are ahead - come on, now, Angelina - Keeper Bletchley dives - misses - GRYFFINDORS SCORE!\" Gryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from the Slytherins. \"Budge up there, move along.\" \"Hagrid!\" Ron and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid enough space to join them. \"Bin watchin\\' from me hut,\" said Hagrid, patting a large pair of binoculars around his neck, \"But it isn\\'t the same as bein\\' in the crowd. No sign of the Snitch yet, eh?\" \"Nope,\" said Ron. \"Harry hasn\\'t had much to do yet.\" \"Kept outta trouble, though, that\\'s somethin\\',\" said Hagrid, raising his binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was Harry. Way up above them, Harry was gliding over the game, squinting about for some sign of the Snitch. This was part of his and Wood\\'s game plan. \"Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch,\" Wood had said. \"We don\\'t want you attacked before you have to be.\" When Angelina had scored, Harry had done a couple of loop-the-loops to let off his feelings. Now he was back to staring around for the Snitch. Once he caught sight of a flash of gold, but it was just a reflection from one of the Weasleys\\' wristwatches, and once a Bludger decided to come pelting his way, more like a cannonball than anything, but Harry dodged it and Fred Weasley came chasing after it. \"All right there, Harry?\" he had time to yell, as he beat the Bludger furiously toward Marcus Flint. \"Slytherin in possession,\" Lee Jordan was saying, \"Chaser Pucey ducks two Bludgers, two Weasleys, and Chaser Bell, and speeds toward the - wait a moment - was that the Snitch?\" A murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey dropped the Quaffle, too busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his left ear. Harry saw it. In a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the streak of gold. Slytherin Seeker Terence Higgs had seen it, too. Neck and neck they hurtled toward the Snitch - all the Chasers seemed to have forgotten what they were supposed to be doing as they hung in midair to watch. Harry was faster than Higgs - he could see the little round ball, wings fluttering, darting up ahead - he put on an extra spurt of speed - WHAM! A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors below - Marcus Flint had blocked Harry on purpose, and Harry\\'s broom spun off course, Harry holding on for dear life. \"Foul!\" screamed the Gryffindors. Madam Hooch spoke angrily to Flint and then ordered a free shot at the goal posts for Gryffindor. But in all the confusion, of course, the Golden Snitch had disappeared from sight again. Down in the stands, Dean Thomas was yelling, \"Send him off, ref! Red card!\" \"What are you talking about, Dean?\" said Ron. \"Red card!\" said Dean furiously. \"In soccer you get shown the red card and you\\'re out of the game!\" \"But this isn\\'t soccer, Dean,\" Ron reminded him. Hagrid, however, was on Dean\\'s side. \"They oughta change the rules. Flint coulda knocked Harry outta the air.\" Lee Jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides. \"So - after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating - \" \"Jordan!\" growled Professor McGonagall. \"I mean, after that open and revolting foul–\" \"Jordan, I\\'m warning you - \" \"All right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which could happen to anyone, I\\'m sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor, taken by Spinner, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor still in possession.\" It was as Harry dodged another Bludger, which went spinning dangerously past his head, that it happened. His broom gave a sudden, frightening lurch. For a split second, he thought he was going to fall. He gripped the broom tightly with both his hands and knees. He\\'d never felt anything like that. It happened again. It was as though the broom was trying to buck him off. But Nimbus Two Thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their riders off. Harry tried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goal-posts - he had half a mind to ask Wood to call time-out - and then he realized that his broom was completely out of his control. He couldn\\'t turn it. He couldn\\'t direct it at all. It was zigzagging through the air, and every now and then making violent swishing movements that almost unseated him. Lee was still commentating. \"Slytherin in possession - Flint with the Quaffle - passes Spinnet - passes Bell - hit hard in the face by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose - only joking, Professor - Slytherins score - A no–\" The Slytherins were cheering. No one seemed to have noticed that Harry\\'s broom was behaving strangely. It was carrying him slowly higher, away from the game, jerking and twitching as it went. \"Dunno what Harry thinks he\\'s doing,\" Hagrid mumbled. He stared through his binoculars. \"If I didn\\' know better, I\\'d say he\\'d lost control of his broom– but he can\\'t have–\" Suddenly, people were pointing up at Harry all over the stands. His broom had started to roll over and over, with him only just managing to hold on. Then the whole crowd gasped. Harry\\'s broom had given a wild jerk and Harry swung off it. He was now dangling from it, holding on with only one hand. \"Did something happen to it when Flint blocked him?\" Seamus whispered. \"Can\\'t have,\" Hagrid said, his voice shaking. \"Can\\'t nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful Dark magic - no kid could do that to a Nimbus Two Thousand.\" At these words, Hermione seized Hagrid\\'s binoculars, but instead of looking up at Harry, she started looking frantically at the crowd. \"What are you doing?\" moaned Ron, gray-faced. \"I knew it,\" Hermione gasped, \"Snape - look.\" Ron grabbed the binoculars. Snape was in the middle of the stands opposite them. He had his eyes fixed on Harry and was muttering nonstop under his breath. \"He\\'s doing something - jinxing the broom,\" said Hermione. \"What should we do?\" \"Leave it to me.\" Before Ron could say another word, Hermione had disappeared. Ron turned the binoculars back on Harry. His broom was vibrating so hard, it was almost impossible for him to hang on much longer. The whole crowd was on its feet, watching, terrified, as the Weasleys flew up to try and pull Harry safely onto one of their brooms, but it was no good Œ every time they got near him, the broom would jump higher still. They dropped lower and circled beneath him, obviously hoping to catch him if he fell. Marcus Flint seized the Quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticing. \"Come on, Hermione,\" Ron muttered desperately. Hermione had fought her way across to the stand where Snape stood, and was now racing along the row behind him; she didn\\'t even stop to say sorry as she knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in front. Reaching Snape, she crouched down, pulled out her wand, and whispered a few, well-chosen words. Bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the hem of Snape\\'s robes. It took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize that he was on fire. A sudden yelp told her she had done her job. Scooping the fire off him into a little jar in her pocket, she scrambled back along the row - Snape would never know what had happened. It was enough. Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able to clamber back on to his broom. \"Neville, you can look!\" Ron said. Neville had been sobbing into Hagrid\\'s jacket for the last five minutes. Harry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick - he hit the field on all fours - coughed - and something gold fell into his hand. \"I\\'ve got the Snitch!\" he shouted, waving it above his head, and the game ended in complete confusion. \"He didn\\'t catch it, he nearly swallowed it,\" Flint was still howling twenty minutes later, but it made no difference - Harry hadn\\'t broken any rules and Lee Jordan was still happily shouting the results - Gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty. Harry heard none of this, though. He was being made a cup of strong tea back in Hagrid\\'s hut, with Ron and Hermione. \"It was Snape,\" Ron was explaining, \"Hermione and I saw him. He was cursing your broomstick, muttering, he wouldn\\'t take his eyes off you.\" \"Rubbish,\" said Hagrid, who hadn\\'t heard a word of what had gone on next to him in the stands. \"Why would Snape do somethin\\' like that?\" Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering what to tell him. Harry decided on the truth. \"I found out something about him,\" he told Hagrid. \"He tried to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween. It bit him. We think he was trying to steal whatever it\\'s guarding.\" Hagrid dropped the teapot. \"How do you know about Fluffy?\" he said. \"Fluffy?\" \"Yeah - he\\'s mine - bought him off a Greek chappie I met in the pub las\\' year - I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the - \" \"Yes?\" said Harry eagerly. \"Now, don\\'t ask me anymore,\" said Hagrid gruffly. \"That\\'s top secret, that is.\" \"But Snape\\'s trying to steal it.\" \"Rubbish,\" said Hagrid again. \"Snape\\'s a Hogwarts teacher, he\\'d do nothin\\' of the sort.\" \"So why did he just try and kill Harry?\" cried Hermione. The afternoon\\'s events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about Snape. \"I know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I\\'ve read all about them! You\\'ve got to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn\\'t blinking at all, I saw him!\" \"I\\'m tellin\\' yeh, yer wrong!\" said Hagrid hotly. \"I don\\' know why Harry\\'s broom acted like that, but Snape wouldn\\' try an\\' kill a student! Now, listen to me, all three of yeh - yer meddlin\\' in things that don\\' concern yeh. It\\'s dangerous. You forget that dog, an\\' you forget what it\\'s guardin\\', that\\'s between Professor Dumbledore an\\' Nicolas Flamel - \" \"Aha!\" said Harry, \"so there\\'s someone called Nicolas Flamel involved, is there?\" Hagrid looked furious with himself. CHAPTER TWELVE The Mirror of Erised Christmas was coming. One morning in mid-December, Hogwarts woke to find itself covered in several feet of snow. The lake froze solid and the Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed Quirrell around, bouncing off the back of his turban. The few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by Hagrid before they could fly off again. No one could wait for the holidays to start. While the Gryffindor common room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms. Worst of all were Professor Snape\\'s classes down in the dungeons, where their breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as possible to their hot cauldrons. \"I do feel so sorry,\" said Draco Malfoy, one Potions class, \"for all those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they\\'re not wanted at home.\" He was looking over at Harry as he spoke. Crabbe and Goyle chuckled. Harry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lionfish, ignored them. Malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the Quidditch match. Disgusted that the Slytherins had lost, he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a wide-mouthed tree frog would be replacing Harry as Seeker next. Then he\\'d realized that nobody found this funny, because they were all so impressed at the way Harry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick. So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone back to taunting Harry about having no proper family. It was true that Harry wasn\\'t going back to Privet Drive for Christmas. Professor McGonagall had come around the week before, making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had signed up at once. He didn\\'t feel sorry for himself at all; this would probably be the best Christmas he\\'d ever had. Ron and his brothers were staying, too, because Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were going to Romania to visit Charlie. When they left the dungeons at the end of Potions, they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead. Two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that Hagrid was behind it. \"Hi, Hagrid, want any help?\" Ron asked, sticking his head through the branches. \"Nah, I\\'m all right, thanks, Ron.\" \"Would you mind moving out of the way?\" came Malfoy\\'s cold drawl from behind them. \"Are you trying to earn some extra money, Weasley? Hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts, I suppose - that hut of Hagrid\\'s must seem like a palace compared to what your family\\'s used to.\" Ron dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs. \"WEASLEY!\" Ron let go of the front of Malfoy\\'s robes. \"He was provoked, Professor Snape,\" said Hagrid, sticking his huge hairy face out from behind the tree. \"Malfoy was insultin\\' his family.\" \"Be that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules, Hagrid,\" said Snape silkily. \"Five points from Gryffindor, Weasley, and be grateful it isn\\'t more. Move along, all of you.\" Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past the tree, scattering needles everywhere and smirking. \"I\\'ll get him,\" said Ron, grinding his teeth at Malfoy\\'s back, \"one of these days, I\\'ll get him - \" \"I hate them both,\" said Harry, \"Malfoy and Snape.\" \"Come on, cheer up, it\\'s nearly Christmas,\" said Hagrid. \"Tell yeh what, come with me an\\' see the Great Hall, looks a treat.\" So the three of them followed Hagrid and his tree off to the Great Hall, where Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick were busy with the Christmas decorations. \"Ah, Hagrid, the last tree - put it in the far corner, would you?\" The hall looked spectacular. Festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all around the walls, and no less than twelve towering Christmas trees stood around the room, some sparkling with tiny icicles, some glittering with hundreds of candles. \"How many days you got left until yer holidays?\" Hagrid asked. \"Just one,\" said Hermione. \"And that reminds me - Harry, Ron, we\\'ve got half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library.\" \"Oh yeah, you\\'re right,\" said Ron, tearing his eyes away from Professor Flitwick, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree. \"The library?\" said Hagrid, following them out of the hall. \"Just before the holidays? Bit keen, aren\\'t yeh?\" \"Oh, we\\'re not working,\" Harry told him brightly. \"Ever since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel we\\'ve been trying to find out who he is.\" \"You what?\" Hagrid looked shocked. \"Listen here - I\\'ve told yeh - drop it. It\\'s nothin\\' to you what that dog\\'s guardin\\'.\" \"We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that\\'s all,\" said Hermione. \"Unless you\\'d like to tell us and save us the trouble?\" Harry added. \"We must\\'ve been through hundreds of books already and we can\\'t find him anywhere - just give us a hint - I know I\\'ve read his name somewhere.\" \"I\\'m sayin\\' nothin\\', said Hagrid flatly. \"Just have to find out for ourselves, then,\" said Ron, and they left Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library. They had indeed been searching books for Flamel\\'s name ever since Hagrid had let it slip, because how else were they going to find out what Snape was trying to steal? The trouble was, it was very hard to know where to begin, not knowing what Flamel might have done to get himself into a book. He wasn\\'t in Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century, or Notable Magical Names of Our Time; he was missing, too, from Important Modern Magical Discoveries, and A Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry. And then, of course, there was the sheer size of the library; tens of thousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds of narrow rows. Hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search while Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the shelves at random. Harry wandered over to the Restricted Section. He had been wondering for a while if Flamel wasn\\'t somewhere in there. Unfortunately, you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the restricted books, and he knew he\\'d never get one. These were the books containing powerful Dark Magic never taught at Hogwarts, and only read by older students studying advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts. \"What are you looking for, boy?\" \"Nothing,\" said Harry. Madam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him. \"You\\'d better get out, then. Go on - out!\" Wishing he\\'d been a bit quicker at thinking up some story, Harry left the library. He, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed they\\'d better not ask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel. They were sure she\\'d be able to tell them, but they couldn\\'t risk Snape hearing what they were up to. Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything, but he wasn\\'t very hopeful. They had been looking for two weeks, after A, but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasn\\'t surprising they\\'d found nothing. What they really needed was a nice long search without Madam Pince breathing down their necks. Five minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, shaking their heads. They went off to lunch. \"You will keep looking while I\\'m away, won\\'t you?\" said Hermione. \"And send me an owl if you find anything.\" \"And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is,\" said Ron. \"It\\'d be safe to ask them.\" \"Very safe, as they\\'re both dentists,\" said Hermione. Once the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too good a time to think much about Flamel. They had the dormitory to themselves and the common room was far emptier than usual, so they were able to get the good armchairs by the fire. They sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a toasting fork - bread, English muffins, marshmallows - and plotting ways of getting Malfoy expelled, which were fun to talk about even if they wouldn\\'t work. Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This was exactly like Muggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made it a lot like directing troops in battle. Ron\\'s set was very old and battered. Like everything else he owned, it had once belonged to someone else in his family - in this case, his grandfather. However, old chessmen weren\\'t a drawback at all. Ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wanted. Harry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him, and they didn\\'t trust him at all. He wasn\\'t a very good player yet and they kept shouting different bits of advice at him, which was confusing. \"Don\\'t send me there, can\\'t you see his knight? Send him, we can afford to lose him.\" On Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for the food and the fun, but not expecting any presents at all. When he woke early in the morning, however, the first thing he saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of his bed. \"Merry Christmas,\" said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe. \"You, too,\" said Harry. \"Will you look at this? I\\'ve got some presents!\" \"What did you expect, turnips?\" said Ron, turning to his own pile, which was a lot bigger than Harry\\'s. Harry picked up the top parcel. It was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across it was To Harry, from Hagrid. Inside was a roughly cut wooden flute. Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself. Harry blew it - it sounded a bit like an owl. A second, very small parcel contained a note. We received your message and enclose your Christmas present. From Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia. Taped to the note was a fifty-pence piece. \"That\\'s friendly,\" said Harry. Ron was fascinated by the fifty pence. \"Weird!\" he said, ‚What a shape! This is money?\" \"You can keep it,\" said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was. \"Hagrid and my aunt and uncle - so who sent these?\" \"I think I know who that one\\'s from,\" said Ron, turning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy parcel. \"My mom. I told her you didn\\'t expect any presents and - oh, no,\" he groaned, \"she\\'s made you a Weasley sweater.\" Harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand-knitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge. \"Every year she makes us a sweater,\" said Ron, unwrapping his own, \"and mine\\'s always maroon.\" \"That\\'s really nice of her,\" said Harry, trying the fudge, which was very tasty. His next present also contained candy - a large box of Chocolate Frogs from Hermione. This only left one parcel. Harry picked it up and felt it. It was very light. He unwrapped it. Something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay in gleaming folds. Ron gasped. \"I\\'ve heard of those,\" he said in a hushed voice, dropping the box of Every Flavor Beans he\\'d gotten from Hermione. \"If that\\'s what I think it is - they\\'re really rare, and really valuable.\" \"What is it?\" Harry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor. It was strange to the touch, like water woven into material. \"It\\'s an invisibility cloak,\" said Ron, a look of awe on his face. \"I\\'m sure it is - try it on.\" Harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave a yell. \"It is! Look down!\" Harry looked down at his feet, but they were gone. He dashed to the mirror. Sure enough, his reflection looked back at him, just his head suspended in midair, his body completely invisible. He pulled the cloak over his head and his reflection vanished completely. \"There\\'s a note!\" said Ron suddenly. \"A note fell out of it!\" Harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter. Written in narrow, loopy writing he had never seen before were the following words: Your father left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was returned to you. Use it well. A Very Merry Christmas to you. There was no signature. Harry stared at the note. Ron was admiring the cloak. \"I\\'d give anything for one of these,\" he said. \"Anything. What\\'s the matter?\" \"Nothing,\" said Harry. He felt very strange. Who had sent the cloak? Had it really once belonged to his father? Before he could say or think anything else, the dormitory door was flung open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in. Harry stuffed the cloak quickly out of sight. He didn\\'t feel like sharing it with anyone else yet. \"Merry Christmas!\" \"Hey, look - Harry\\'s got a Weasley sweater, too!\" Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large yellow F on it, the other a G. \"Harry\\'s is better than ours, though,\" said Fred, holding up Harry\\'s sweater. \"She obviously makes more of an effort if you\\'re not family.\" \"Why aren\\'t you wearing yours, Ron?\" George demanded. \"Come on, get it on, they\\'re lovely and warm.\" \"I hate maroon,\" Ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head. \"You haven\\'t got a letter on yours,\" George observed. \"I suppose she thinks you don\\'t forget your name. But we\\'re not stupid - we know we\\'re called Gred and Forge.\" \"What\\'s all this noise?\" Percy Weasley stuck his head through the door, looking disapproving. He had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he, too, carried a lumpy sweater over his arm, which Fred seized. \"P for prefect! Get it on, Percy, come on, we\\'re all wearing ours, even Harry got one.\" \"I - don\\'t - want - \" said Percy thickly, as the twins forced the sweater over his head, knocking his glasses askew. \"And you\\'re not sitting with the prefects today, either,\" said George. \"Christmas is a time for family.\" They frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms pinned to his side by his sweater. Harry had never in all his life had such a Christmas dinner. A hundred fat, roast turkeys; mountains of roast and boiled potatoes; platters of chipolatas; tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich gravy and cranberry sauce Œ and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table. These fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside. Harry pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and it didn\\'t just bang, it went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from the inside exploded a rear admiral\\'s hat and several live, white mice. Up at the High Table, Dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard\\'s hat for a flowered bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick had just read him. Flaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey. Percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice. Harry watched Hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry\\'s amazement, giggled and blushed, her top hat lopsided. When Harry finally left the table, he was laden down with a stack of things out of the crackers, including a pack of nonexplodable, luminous balloons, a Grow-Your-Own-Warts kit, and his own new wizard chess set. The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling they were going to end up as Mrs. Norris\\'s Christmas dinner. Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the grounds. Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron. He suspected he wouldn\\'t have lost so badly if Percy hadn\\'t tried to help him so much. After a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor tower because they\\'d stolen his prefect badge. It had been Harry\\'s best Christmas day ever. Yet something had been nagging at the back of his mind all day. Not until he climbed into bed was he free to think about it: the invisibility cloak and whoever had sent it. Ron, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him, fell asleep almost as soon as he\\'d drawn the curtains of his four-poster. Harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it. His father\\'s– this had been his father\\'s. He let the material flow over his hands, smoother than silk, light as air. Use it well, the note had said. He had to try it, now. He slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak around himself. Looking down at his legs, he saw only moonlight and shadows. It was a very funny feeling. Use it well. Suddenly, Harry felt wide-awake. The whole of Hogwarts was open to him in this cloak. Excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the dark and silence. He could go anywhere in this, anywhere, and Filch would never know. Ron grunted in his sleep. Should Harry wake him? Something held him back - his father\\'s cloak - he felt that this time - the first time - he wanted to use it alone. He crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the common room, and climbed through the portrait hole. \"Who\\'s there?\" squawked the Fat Lady. Harry said nothing. He walked quickly down the corridor. Where should he go? He stopped, his heart racing, and thought. And then it came to him. The Restricted Section in the library. He\\'d be able to read as long as he liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel was. He set off, drawing the invisibility cloak tight around him as he walked. The library was pitch-black and very eerie. Harry lit a lamp to see his way along the rows of books. The lamp looked as if it was floating along in midair, and even though Harry could feel his arm supporting it, the sight gave him the creeps. The Restricted Section was right at the back of the library. Stepping carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the library, he held up his lamp to read the titles. They didn\\'t tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold letters spelled words in languages Harry couldn\\'t understand. Some had no title at all. One book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood. The hairs on the back of Harry\\'s neck prickled. Maybe he was imagining it, maybe not, but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books, as though they knew someone was there who shouldn\\'t be. He had to start somewhere. Setting the lamp down carefully on the floor, he looked along the bottom shelf for an interesting looking book. A large black and silver volume caught his eye. He pulled it out with difficulty, because it was very heavy, and, balancing it on his knee, let it fall open. A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence - the book was screaming! Harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and on, one high, unbroken, earsplitting note. He stumbled backward and knocked over his lamp, which went out at once. Panicking, he heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside - stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf, he ran for it. He passed Filch in the doorway; Filch\\'s pale, wild eyes looked straight through him, and Harry slipped under Filch\\'s outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, the book\\'s shrieks still ringing in his ears. He came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor. He had been so busy getting away from the library, he hadn\\'t paid attention to where he was going. Perhaps because it was dark, he didn\\'t recognize where he was at all. There was a suit of armor near the kitchens, he knew, but he must be five floors above there. \"You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was wandering around at night, and somebody\\'s been in the library Restricted Section.\" Harry felt the blood drain out of his face. Wherever he was, Filch must know a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and to his horror, it was Snape who replied, \"The Restricted Section? Well, they can\\'t be far, we\\'ll catch them.\" Harry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner ahead. They couldn\\'t see him, of course, but it was a narrow corridor and if they came much nearer they\\'d knock right into him - the cloak didn\\'t stop him from being solid. He backed away as quietly as he could. A door stood ajar to his left. It was his only hope. He squeezed through it, holding his breath, trying not to move it, and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their noticing anything. They walked straight past, and Harry leaned against the wall, breathing deeply, listening to their footsteps dying away. That had been close, very close. It was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in. It looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper basket Œ but propped against the wall facing him was something that didn\\'t look as if it belonged there, something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the way. It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet. There was an inscription carved around the top: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. His panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again. He stepped in front of it. He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming. He whirled around. His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed - for he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right behind him. But the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to the mirror. There he was, reflected in it, white and scared-looking, and there, reflected behind him, were at least ten others. Harry looked over his shoulder - but still, no one was there. Or were they all invisible, too? Was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirror\\'s trick was that it reflected them, invisible or not? He looked in the mirror again. A woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving. He reached out a hand and felt the air behind him. If she was really there, he\\'d touch her, their reflections were so close together, but he felt only air Œ she and the others existed only in the mirror. She was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her eyes - her eyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging a little closer to the glass. Bright green - exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same time. The tall, thin, black-haired man standing next to her put his arm around her. He wore glasses, and his hair was very untidy. It stuck up at the back, just as Harry\\'s did. Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflection. \"Mom?\" he whispered. \"Dad?\" They just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as though he had Harry\\'s knobbly knees - Harry was looking at his family, for the first time in his life. The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness. How long he stood there, he didn\\'t know. The reflections did not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses. He couldn\\'t stay here, he had to find his way back to bed. He tore his eyes away from his mother\\'s face, whispered, \"I\\'ll come back,\" and hurried from the room. \"You could have woken me up,\" said Ron, crossly. \"You can come tonight, I\\'m going back, I want to show you the mirror.\" \"I\\'d like to see your mom and dad,\" Ron said eagerly. \"And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, you\\'ll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone.\" \"You can see them any old time,\" said Ron. \"Just come round my house this summer. Anyway, maybe it only shows dead people. Shame about not finding Flamel, though. Have some bacon or something, why aren\\'t you eating anything?\" Harry couldn\\'t eat. He had seen his parents and would be seeing them again tonight. He had almost forgotten about Flamel. It didn\\'t seem very important anymore. Who cared what the three headed dog was guarding? What did it matter if Snape stole it, really? \"Are you all right?\" said Ron. \"You look odd.\" What Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room again. With Ron covered in the cloak, too, they had to walk much more slowly the next night. They tried retracing Harry\\'s route from the library, wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour. \"I\\'m freezing,\" said Ron. \"Let\\'s forget it and go back.\" \"No!\" Harry hissed. \"I know it\\'s here somewhere.\" They passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction, but saw no one else. just as Ron started moaning that his feet were dead with cold, Harry spotted the suit of armor. \"It\\'s here - just here - yes!\" They pushed the door open. Harry dropped the cloak from around his shoulders and ran to the mirror. There they were. His mother and father beamed at the sight of him. \"See?\" Harry whispered. \"I can\\'t see anything.\" \"Look! Look at them all– there are loads of them–\" \"I can only see you.\" \"Look in it properly, go on, stand where I am.\" Harry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, he couldn\\'t see his family anymore, just Ron in his paisley pajamas. Ron, though, was staring transfixed at his image. \"Look at me!\" he said. \"Can you see all your family standing around you?\" \"No - I\\'m alone - but I\\'m different - I look older - and I\\'m head boy!\" \"What?\" \"I am - I\\'m wearing the badge like Bill used to - and I\\'m holding the house cup and the Quidditch cup - I\\'m Quidditch captain, too.\" Ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at Harry. \"Do you think this mirror shows the future?\" \"How can it? All my family are dead - let me have another look - \" \"You had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit more time.\" \"You\\'re only holding the Quidditch cup, what\\'s interesting about that? I want to see my parents.\" \"Don\\'t push me - \" A sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion. They hadn\\'t realized how loudly they had been talking. \"Quick!\" Ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of Mrs. Norris came round the door. Ron and Harry stood quite still, both thinking the same thing - did the cloak work on cats? After what seemed an age, she turned and left. \"This isn\\'t safe - she might have gone for Filch, I bet she heard us. Come on.\" And Ron pulled Harry out of the room. The snow still hadn\\'t melted the next morning. \"Want to play chess, Harry?\" said Ron. \"No.\" \"Why don\\'t we go down and visit Hagrid?\" \"No– you go–\" \"I know what you\\'re thinking about, Harry, that mirror. Don\\'t go back tonight.\" \"Why not?\" \"I dunno, I\\'ve just got a bad feeling about it - and anyway, you\\'ve had too many close shaves already. Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris are wandering around. So what if they can\\'t see you? What if they walk into you? What if you knock something over?\" \"You sound like Hermione.\" \"I\\'m serious, Harry, don\\'t go.\" But Harry only had one thought in his head, which was to get back in front of the mirror, and Ron wasn\\'t going to stop him. That third night he found his way more quickly than before. He was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise, but he didn\\'t meet anyone. And there were his mother and father smiling at him again, and one of his grandfathers nodding happily. Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror. There was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family. Nothing at all. Except - \"So - back again, Harry?\" Harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice. He looked behind him. Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus Dumbledore. Harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to get to the mirror he hadn\\'t noticed him. \"I - I didn\\'t see you, sir.\" \"Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,\" said Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling. \"So,\" said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry, \"you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.\" \"I didn\\'t know it was called that, Sir.\" \"But I expect you\\'ve realized by now what it does?\" \"It - well - it shows me my family - \" \"And it showed your friend Ron himself as head boy.\" \"How did you know - ?\" \"I don\\'t need a cloak to become invisible,\" said Dumbledore gently. \"Now, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?\" Harry shook his head. \"Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is. Does that help?\" Harry thought. Then he said slowly, \"It shows us what we want– whatever we want–\" \"Yes and no,\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have never known your family, see them standing around you. Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the best of all of them. However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible. \"The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry, and I ask you not to go looking for it again. If you ever do run across it, you will now be prepared. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that. Now, why don\\'t you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to bed?\" Harry stood up. \"Sir - Professor Dumbledore? Can I ask you something?\" \"Obviously, you\\'ve just done so,\" Dumbledore smiled. \"You may ask me one more thing, however.\" \"What do you see when you look in the mirror?\" \"I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.\" Harry stared. \"One can never have enough socks,\" said Dumbledore. \"Another Christmas has come and gone and I didn\\'t get a single pair. People will insist on giving me books.\" It was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that Dumbledore might not have been quite truthful. But then, he thought, as he shoved Scabbers off his pillow, it had been quite a personal question. CHAPTER THIRTEEN Nicholas Flamel Dumbledore had convinced Harry not to go looking for the Mirror of Erised again, and for the rest of the Christmas holidays the invisibility cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk. Harry wished he could forget what he\\'d seen in the mirror as easily, but he couldn\\'t. He started having nightmares. Over and over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high voice cackled with laughter. \"You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you mad,\" said Ron, when Harry told him about these dreams. Hermione, who came back the day before term started, took a different view of things. She was torn between horror at the idea of Harry being out of bed, roaming the school three nights in a row (\"If Filch had caught you!\"), and disappointment that he hadn\\'t at least found out who Nicolas Flamel was. They had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel in a library book, even though Harry was still sure he\\'d read the name somewhere. Once term had started, they were back to skimming through books for ten minutes during their breaks. Harry had even less time than the other two, because Quidditch practice had started again. Wood was working the team harder than ever. Even the endless rain that had replaced the snow couldn\\'t dampen his spirits. The Weasleys complained that Wood was becoming a fanatic, but Harry was on Wood\\'s side. If they won their next match, against Hufflepuff, they would overtake Slytherin in the house championship for the first time in seven years. Quite apart from wanting to win, Harry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after training. Then, during one particularly wet and muddy practice session, Wood gave the team a bit of bad news. He\\'d just gotten very angry with the Weasleys, who kept dive-bombing each other and pretending to fall off their brooms. \"Will you stop messing around!\" he yelled. \"That\\'s exactly the sort of thing that\\'ll lose us the match! Snape\\'s refereeing this time, and he\\'ll be looking for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!\" George Weasley really did fall off his broom at these words. \"Snape\\'s refereeing?\" he spluttered through a mouthful of mud. \"When\\'s he ever refereed a Quidditch match? He\\'s not going to be fair if we might overtake Slytherin.\" The rest of the team landed next to George to complain, too. \"It\\'s not my fault,\" said Wood. \"We\\'ve just got to make sure we play a clean game, so Snape hasn\\'t got an excuse to pick on us.\" Which was all very well, thought Harry, but he had another reason for not wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch– The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room, where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess. Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very good for her. \"Don\\'t talk to me for a moment,\" said Ron when Harry sat down next to him, \"I need to concen - \" He caught sight of Harry\\'s face. \"What\\'s the matter with you? You look terrible.\" Speaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the other two about Snape\\'s sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee. \"Don\\'t play,\" said Hermione at once. \"Say you\\'re ill,\" said Ron. \"Pretend to break your leg,\" Hermione suggested. \"Really break your leg,\" said Ron. \"I can\\'t,\" said Harry. \"There isn\\'t a reserve Seeker. If I back out, Gryffindor can\\'t play at all.\" At that moment Neville toppled into the common room. How he had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyone\\'s guess, because his legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the Leg-Locker Curse. He must have had to bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor tower. Everyone fell over laughing except Hermione, who leapt up and performed the countercurse. Neville\\'s legs sprang apart and he got to his feet, trembling. \"What happened?\" Hermione asked him, leading him over to sit with Harry and Ron. \"Malfoy,\" said Neville shakily. \"I met him outside the library. He said he\\'d been looking for someone to practice that on.\" \"Go to Professor McGonagall!\" Hermione urged Neville. \"Report him!\" Neville shook his head. \"I don\\'t want more trouble,\" he mumbled. \"You\\'ve got to stand up to him, Neville!\" said Ron. \"He\\'s used to walking all over people, but that\\'s no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier.\" \"There\\'s no need to tell me I\\'m not brave enough to be in Gryffindor, Malfoy\\'s already done that,\" Neville choked out. Harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a Chocolate Frog, the very last one from the box Hermione had given him for Christmas. He gave it to Neville, who looked as though he might cry. \"You\\'re worth twelve of Malfoy,\" Harry said. \"The Sorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor, didn\\'t it? And where\\'s Malfoy? In stinking Slytherin.\" Neville\\'s lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frog. \"Thanks, Harry– I think I\\'ll go to bed– D\\'you want the card, you collect them, don\\'t you?\" As Neville walked away, Harry looked at the Famous Wizard card. \"Dumbledore again,\" he said, \"He was the first one I ever - \" He gasped. He stared at the back of the card. Then he looked up at Ron and Hermione. \"I\\'ve found him!\" he whispered. \"I\\'ve found Flamel! I told you I\\'d read the name somewhere before, I read it on the train coming here - listen to this: ‚Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon\\'s blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel\\'!\" Hermione jumped to her feet. She hadn\\'t looked so excited since they\\'d gotten back the marks for their very first piece of homework. \"Stay there!\" she said, and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls\\' dormitories. Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms. \"I never thought to look in here!\" she whispered excitedly. \"I got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading.\" \"Light?\" said Ron, but Hermione told him to be quiet until she\\'d looked something up, and started flicking frantically through the pages, muttering to herself. At last she found what she was looking for. \"I knew it! I knew it!\" \"Are we allowed to speak yet?\" said Ron grumpily. Hermione ignored him. \"Nicolas Flamel,\" she whispered dramatically, \"is the only known maker of the Sorcerer\\'s Stone!\" This didn\\'t have quite the effect she\\'d expected. \"The what?\" said Harry and Ron. \"Oh, honestly, don\\'t you two read? Look Œ read that, there.\" She pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Ron read: The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer\\'s Stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers. The stone will transform any metal into pure gold. It also produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal. There have been many reports of the Sorcerer\\'s Stone over the centuries, but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel, who celebrated his six hundred and sixty-fifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle (six hundred and fifty-eight). \"See?\" said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished. \"The dog must be guarding Flamel\\'s Sorcerer\\'s Stone! I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep it safe for him, because they\\'re friends and he knew someone was after it, that\\'s why he wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!\" \"A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!\" said Harry. \"No wonder Snape\\'s after it! Anyone would want it.\" \"And no wonder we couldn\\'t find Flamel in that Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry,\" said Ron. \"He\\'s not exactly recent if he\\'s six hundred and sixty-five, is he?\" The next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites, Harry and Ron were still discussing what they\\'d do with a Sorcerer\\'s Stone if they had one. It wasn\\'t until Ron said he\\'d buy his own Quidditch team that Harry remembered about Snape and the coming match. \"I\\'m going to play,\" he told Ron and Hermione. \"If I don\\'t, all the Slytherins will think I\\'m just too scared to face Snape. I\\'ll show them– it\\'ll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win.\" \"Just as long as we\\'re not wiping you off the field,\" said Hermione. As the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more nervous, whatever he told Ron and Hermione. The rest of the team wasn\\'t too calm, either. The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the house championship was wonderful, no one had done it for seven years, but would they be allowed to, with such a biased referee? Harry didn\\'t know whether he was imagining it or not, but he seemed to keep running into Snape wherever he went. At times, he even wondered whether Snape was following him, trying to catch him on his own. Potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture, Snape was so horrible to Harry. Could Snape possibly know they\\'d found out about the Sorcerer\\'s Stone? Harry didn\\'t see how he could - yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that Snape could read minds. Harry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether they\\'d ever see him alive again. This wasn\\'t what you\\'d call comforting. Harry hardly heard a word of Wood\\'s pep talk as he pulled on his Quidditch robes and picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand. Ron and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next to Neville, who couldn\\'t understand why they looked so grim and worried, or why they had both brought their wands to the match. Little did Harry know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg-Locker Curse. They\\'d gotten the idea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were ready to use it on Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry. \"Now, don\\'t forget, it\\'s Locomotor Mortis,\" Hermione muttered as Ron slipped his wand up his sleeve. \"I know,\" Ron snapped. \"Don\\'t nag.\" Back in the locker room, Wood had taken Harry aside. \"Don\\'t want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever need an early capture of the Snitch it\\'s now. Finish the game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too much.\" \"The whole school\\'s out there!\" said Fred Weasley, peering out of the door. \"Even - blimey - Dumbledore\\'s come to watch!\" Harry\\'s heart did a somersault. \"Dumbledore?\" he said, dashing to the door to make sure. Fred was right. There was no mistaking that silver beard. Harry could have laughed out loud with relief, he was safe. There was simply no way that Snape would dare to try to hurt him if Dumbledore was watching. Perhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as the teams marched onto the field, something that Ron noticed, too. \"I\\'ve never seen Snape look so mean,\" he told Hermione. \"Look - they\\'re off. Ouch!\" Someone had poked Ron in the back of the head. It was Malfoy. \"Oh, sorry, Weasley, didn\\'t see you there.\" Malfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle. \"Wonder how long Potter\\'s going to stay on his broom this time? Anyone want a bet? What about you, Weasley?\" Ron didn\\'t answer; Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff a penalty because George Weasley had hit a Bludger at him. Hermione, who had all her fingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry, who was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the Snitch. \"You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team?\" said Malfoy loudly a few minutes later, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all. \"It\\'s people they feel sorry for. See, there\\'s Potter, who\\'s got no parents, then there\\'s the Weasleys, who\\'ve got no money - you should be on the team, Longbottom, you\\'ve got no brains.\" Neville went bright red but turned in his seat to face Malfoy. \"I\\'m worth twelve of you, Malfoy,\" he stammered. Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still not daring to take his eyes from the game, said, \"You tell him, Neville.\" \"Longbottom, if brains were gold you\\'d be poorer than Weasley, and that\\'s saying something.\" Ron\\'s nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about Harry. \"I\\'m warning you, Malfoy - one more word - \" \"Ron!\" said Hermione suddenly, \"Harry - \" \"What? Where?\" Harry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd. Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her mouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet. \"You\\'re in luck, Weasley, Potter\\'s obviously spotted some money on the ground!\" said Malfoy. Ron snapped. Before Malfoy knew what was happening, Ron was on top of him, wrestling him to the ground. Neville hesitated, then clambered over the back of his seat to help. \"Come on, Harry!\" Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape - she didn\\'t even notice Malfoy and Ron rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle. Up in the air, Snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see something scarlet shoot past him, missing him by inches - the next second, Harry had pulled out of the dive, his arm raised in triumph, the Snitch clasped in his hand. The stands erupted; it had to be a record, no one could ever remember the Snitch being caught so quickly. \"Ron! Ron! Where are you? The game\\'s over! Harry\\'s won! We\\'ve won! Gryffindor is in the lead!\" shrieked Hermione, dancing up and down on her seat and hugging Parvati Patil in the row in front. Harry jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground. He couldn\\'t believe it. He\\'d done it - the game was over; it had barely lasted five minutes. As Gryffindors came spilling onto the field, he saw Snape land nearby, white-faced and tight-lipped - then Harry felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up into Dumbledore\\'s smiling face. \"Well done,\" said Dumbledore quietly, so that only Harry could hear. \"Nice to see you haven\\'t been brooding about that mirror– been keeping busy– excellent–\" Snape spat bitterly on the ground. Harry left the locker room alone some time later, to take his Nimbus Two Thousand back to the broomshed. He couldn\\'t ever remember feeling happier. He\\'d really done something to be proud of now Œ no one could say he was just a famous name any more. The evening air had never smelled so sweet. He walked over the damp grass, reliving the last hour in his head, which was a happy blur: Gryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders; Ron and Hermione in the distance, jumping up and down, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed. Harry had reached the shed. He leaned against the wooden door and looked up at Hogwarts, with its windows glowing red in the setting sun. Gryffindor in the lead. He\\'d done it, he\\'d shown Snape– And speaking of Snape– A hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle. Clearly not wanting to be seen, it walked as fast as possible toward the forbidden forest. Harry\\'s victory faded from his mind as he watched. He recognized the figure\\'s prowling walk. Snape, sneaking into the forest while everyone else was at dinner - what was going on? Harry jumped back on his Nimbus Two Thousand and took off. Gliding silently over the castle he saw Snape enter the forest at a run. He followed. The trees were so thick he couldn\\'t see where Snape had gone. He flew in circles, lower and lower, brushing the top branches of trees until he heard voices. He glided toward them and landed noiselessly in a towering beech tree. He climbed carefully along one of the branches, holding tight to his broomstick, trying to see through the leaves. Below, in a shadowy clearing, stood Snape, but he wasn\\'t alone. Quirrell was there, too. Harry couldn\\'t make out the look on his face, but he was stuttering worse than ever. Harry strained to catch what they were saying. \"– d-don\\'t know why you wanted t-t-to meet here of all p-places, Severus–\" \"Oh, I thought we\\'d keep this private,\" said Snape, his voice icy. \"Students aren\\'t supposed to know about the Sorcerer\\'s Stone, after all.\" Harry leaned forward. Quirrell was mumbling something. Snape interrupted him. \"Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid\\'s yet?\" \"B-b-but Severus, I - \" \"You don\\'t want me as your enemy, Quirrell,\" said Snape, taking a step toward him. \"I-I don\\'t know what you - \" \"You know perfectly well what I mean.\" An owl hooted loudly, and Harry nearly fell out of the tree. He steadied himself in time to hear Snape say, \" - your little bit of hocus-pocus. I\\'m waiting.\" \"B-but I d-d-don\\'t - \" \"Very well,\" Snape cut in. \"We\\'ll have another little chat soon, when you\\'ve had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie.\" He threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing. It was almost dark now, but Harry could see Quirrell, standing quite still as though he was petrified. \"Harry, where have you been?\" Hermione squeaked. \"We won! You won! We won!\" shouted Ron, thumping Harry on the back. \"And I gave Malfoy a black eye, and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single-handed! He\\'s still out cold but Madam Pomfrey says he\\'ll be all right - talk about showing Slytherin! Everyone\\'s waiting for you in the common room, we\\'re having a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens.\" \"Never mind that now,\" said Harry breathlessly. \"Let\\'s find an empty room, you wait \\'til you hear this–\" He made sure Peeves wasn\\'t inside before shutting the door behind them, then he told them what he\\'d seen and heard. \"So we were right, it is the Sorcerer\\'s Stone, and Snape\\'s trying to force Quirrell to help him get it. He asked if he knew how to get past Fluffy - and he said something about Quirrell\\'s ‚hocus pocus\\' - I reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from Fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell would have done some anti-Dark Arts spell that Snape needs to break through - \" \"So you mean the Stone\\'s only safe as long as Quirrell stands up to Snape?\" said Hermione in alarm. \"It\\'ll be gone by next Tuesday,\" said Ron. CHAPTER FOURTEEN Norbert the Norwegian Ridgeback Quirrell, however, must have been braver than they\\'d thought. In the weeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner, but it didn\\'t look as though he\\'d cracked yet. Every time they passed the third-floor corridor, Harry, Ron, and Hermione would press their ears to the door to check that Fluffy was still growling inside. Snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper, which surely meant that the Stone was still safe. Whenever Harry passed Quirrell these days he gave him an encouraging sort of smile, and Ron had started telling people off for laughing at Quirrell\\'s stutter. Hermione, however, had more on her mind than the Sorcerer\\'s Stone. She had started drawing up study schedules and color coding all her notes. Harry and Ron wouldn\\'t have minded, but she kept nagging them to do the same. \"Hermione, the exams are ages away.\" \"Ten weeks,\" Hermione snapped. \"That\\'s not ages, that\\'s like a second to Nicolas Flamel.\" \"But we\\'re not six hundred years old,\" Ron reminded her. \"Anyway, what are you studying for, you already know it\\'s an A.\" \"What am I studying for? Are you crazy? You realize we need to pass these exams to get into the second year? They\\'re very important, I should have started studying a month ago, I don\\'t know what\\'s gotten into me–\" Unfortunately, the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same lines as Hermione. They piled so much homework on them that the Easter holidays weren\\'t nearly as much fun as the Christmas ones. It was hard to relax with Hermione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragon\\'s blood or practicing wand movements. Moaning and yawning, Harry and Ron spent most of their free time in the library with her, trying to get through all their extra work. \"I\\'ll never remember this,\" Ron burst out one afternoon, throwing down his quill and looking longingly out of the library window. It was the first really fine day they\\'d had in months. The sky was a clear, forget-me-not blue, and there was a feeling in the air of summer coming. Harry, who was looking up \"Dittany\" in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi, didn\\'t look up until he heard Ron say, \"Hagrid! What are you doing in the library?\" Hagrid shuffled into view, hiding something behind his back. He looked very out of place in his moleskin overcoat. \"Jus\\' lookin\\',\" he said, in a shifty voice that got their interest at once. \"An\\' what\\'re you lot up ter?\" He looked suddenly suspicious. \"Yer not still lookin\\' fer Nicolas Flamel, are yeh?\" \"Oh, we found out who he is ages ago,\" said Ron impressively. \"And we know what that dog\\'s guarding, it\\'s a Sorcerer\\'s St - \" \"Shhhh!\" Hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening. \"Don\\' go shoutin\\' about it, what\\'s the matter with yeh?\" \"There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of fact,\" said Harry, \"about what\\'s guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy - \" \"SHHHH!\" said Hagrid again. \"Listen - come an\\' see me later, I\\'m not promisin\\' I\\'ll tell yeh anythin\\', mind, but don\\' go rabbitin\\' about it in here, students aren\\' s\\'pposed ter know. They\\'ll think I\\'ve told yeh - \" \"See you later, then,\" said Harry. Hagrid shuffled off. \"What was he hiding behind his back?\" said Hermione thoughtfully. \"Do you think it had anything to do with the Stone?\" \"I\\'m going to see what section he was in,\" said Ron, who\\'d had enough of working. He came back a minute later with a pile of books in his arms and slammed them down on the table. \"Dragons!\" he whispered. \"Hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons! Look at these: Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland; From Egg to Inferno, A Dragon Keeper\\'s Guide. \" \"Hagrid\\'s always wanted a dragon, he told me so the first time I ever met him, \" said Harry. \"But it\\'s against our laws,\" said Ron. \"Dragon breeding was outlawed by the Warlocks\\' Convention of 1709, everyone knows that. It\\'s hard to stop Muggles from noticing us if we\\'re keeping dragons in the back garden - anyway, you can\\'t tame dragons, it\\'s dangerous. You should see the burns Charlie\\'s got off wild ones in Romania.\" \"But there aren\\'t wild dragons in Britain?\" said Harry. \"Of course there are,\" said Ron. \"Common Welsh Green and Hebridean Blacks. The Ministry of Magic has a job hushing them up, I can tell you. Our kind have to keep putting spells on Muggles who\\'ve spotted them, to make them forget.\" \"So what on earth\\'s Hagrid up to?\" said Hermione. When they knocked on the door of the gamekeeper\\'s hut an hour later, they were surprised to see that all the curtains were closed. Hagrid called \"Who is it?\" before he let them in, and then shut the door quickly behind them. It was stifling hot inside. Even though it was such a warm day, there was a blazing fire in the grate. Hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat sandwiches, which they refused. \"So - yeh wanted to ask me somethin\\'?\" \"Yes,\" said Harry. There was no point beating around the bush. \"We were wondering if you could tell us what\\'s guarding the Sorcerer\\'s Stone apart from Fluffy.\" Hagrid frowned at him. \"O\\' course I can\\'t,\" he said. \"Number one, I don\\' know meself. Number two, yeh know too much already, so I wouldn\\' tell yeh if I could. That Stone\\'s here fer a good reason. It was almost stolen outta Gringotts - I s\\'ppose yeh\\'ve worked that out an\\' all? Beats me how yeh even know abou\\' Fluffy.\" \"Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us, but you do know, you know everything that goes on round here,\" said Hermione in a warm, flattering voice. Hagrid\\'s beard twitched and they could tell he was smiling. \"We only wondered who had done the guarding, really.\" Hermione went on. \"We wondered who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him, apart from you.\" Hagrid\\'s chest swelled at these last words. Harry and Ron beamed at Hermione. \"Well, I don\\' s\\'pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that– let\\'s see– he borrowed Fluffy from me– then some o\\' the teachers did enchantments– Professor Sprout - Professor Flitwick - Professor McGonagall - \" he ticked them off on his fingers, \"Professor Quirrell - an\\' Dumbledore himself did somethin\\', o\\' course. Hang on, I\\'ve forgotten someone. Oh yeah, Professor Snape.\" \"Snape?\" \"Yeah - yer not still on abou\\' that, are yeh? Look, Snape helped protect the Stone, he\\'s not about ter steal it.\" Harry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he was. If Snape had been in on protecting the Stone, it must have been easy to find out how the other teachers had guarded it. He probably knew everything - except, it seemed, Quirrell\\'s spell and how to get past Fluffy. \"You\\'re the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy. aren\\'t you, Hagrid?\" said Harry anxiously. \"And you wouldn\\'t tell anyone, would you? Not even one of the teachers?\" \"Not a soul knows except me an\\' Dumbledore,\" said Hagrid proudly. \"Well, that\\'s something,\" Harry muttered to the others. \"Hagrid, can we have a window open? I\\'m boiling.\" \"Can\\'t, Harry, sorry,\" said Hagrid. Harry noticed him glance at the fire. Harry looked at it, too. \"Hagrid - what\\'s that?\" But he already knew what it was. In the very heart of the fire, underneath the kettle, was a huge, black egg. \"Ah,\" said Hagrid, fiddling nervously with his beard, \"That\\'s - er–\" \"Where did you get it, Hagrid?\" said Ron, crouching over the fire to get a closer look at the egg. \"It must\\'ve cost you a fortune.\" \"Won it,\" said Hagrid. \"Las\\' night. I was down in the village havin\\' a few drinks an\\' got into a game o\\' cards with a stranger. Think he was quite glad ter get rid of it, ter be honest.\" \"But what are you going to do with it when it\\'s hatched?\" said Hermione. \"Well, I\\'ve bin doin\\' some readin\\',\" said Hagrid, pulling a large book from under his pillow. \"Got this outta the library - Dragon Breeding for Pleasure and Profit - it\\'s a bit outta date, o\\' course, but it\\'s all in here. Keep the egg in the fire, ‚cause their mothers breathe on I em, see, an\\' when it hatches, feed it on a bucket o\\' brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour. An\\' see here - how ter recognize diff\\'rent eggs - what I got there\\'s a Norwegian Ridgeback. They\\'re rare, them.\" He looked very pleased with himself, but Hermione didn\\'t. \"Hagrid, you live in a wooden house,\" she said. But Hagrid wasn\\'t listening. He was humming merrily as he stoked the fire. So now they had something else to worry about: what might happen to Hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut. \"Wonder what it\\'s like to have a peaceful life,\" Ron sighed, as evening after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were getting. Hermione had now started making study schedules for Harry and Ron, too. It was driving them nuts. Then, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry another note from Hagrid. He had written only two words: It\\'s hatching. Ron wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to the hut. Hermione wouldn\\'t hear of it. \"Hermione, how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon hatching?\" \"We\\'ve got lessons, we\\'ll get into trouble, and that\\'s nothing to what Hagrid\\'s going to be in when someone finds out what he\\'s doing - \" \"Shut up!\" Harry whispered. Malfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen. How much had he heard? Harry didn\\'t like the look on Malfoy\\'s face at all. Ron and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology and in the end, Hermione agreed to run down to Hagrid\\'s with the other two during morning break. When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their lesson, the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest. Hagrid greeted them, looking flushed and excited. \"It\\'s nearly out.\" He ushered them inside. The egg was lying on the table. There were deep cracks in it. Something was moving inside; a funny clicking noise was coming from it. They all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated breath. All at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open. The baby dragon flopped onto the table. It wasn\\'t exactly pretty; Harry thought it looked like a crumpled, black umbrella. Its spiny wings were huge compared to its skinny jet body, it had a long snout with wide nostrils, the stubs of horns and bulging, orange eyes. It sneezed. A couple of sparks flew out of its snout. \"Isn\\'t he beautiful?\" Hagrid murmured. He reached out a hand to stroke the dragon\\'s head. It snapped at his fingers, showing pointed fangs. \"Bless him, look, he knows his mommy!\" said Hagrid. \"Hagrid,\" said Hermione, \"how fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks grow, exactly?\" Hagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from his face - he leapt to his feet and ran to the window. \"What\\'s the matter?\" \"Someone was lookin\\' through the gap in the curtains - it\\'s a kid - he\\'s runnin\\' back up ter the school.\" Harry bolted to the door and looked out. Even at a distance there was no mistaking him. Malfoy had seen the dragon. Something about the smile lurking on Malfoy\\'s face during the next week made Harry, Ron, and Hermione very nervous. They spent most of their free time in Hagrid\\'s darkened hut, trying to reason with him. \"Just let him go,\" Harry urged. \"Set him free.\" \"I can\\'t,\" said Hagrid. \"He\\'s too little. He\\'d die.\" They looked at the dragon. It had grown three times in length in just a week. Smoke kept furling out of its nostrils. Hagrid hadn\\'t been doing his gamekeeping duties because the dragon was keeping him so busy. There were empty brandy bottles and chicken feathers all over the floor. \"I\\'ve decided to call him Norbert,\" said Hagrid, looking at the dragon with misty eyes. \"He really knows me now, watch. Norbert! Norbert! Where\\'s Mommy?\" \"He\\'s lost his marbles,\" Ron muttered in Harry\\'s ear. \"Hagrid,\" said Harry loudly, \"give it two weeks and Norbert\\'s going to be as long as your house. Malfoy could go to Dumbledore at any moment.\" Hagrid bit his lip. \"I - I know I can\\'t keep him forever, but I can\\'t jus\\' dump him, I can\\'t.\" Harry suddenly turned to Ron. \"Charlie.\" he said. \"You\\'re losing it, too,\" said Ron. \"I\\'m Ron, remember?\" \"No - Charlie - your brother, Charlie. In Romania. Studying dragons. We could send Norbert to him. Charlie can take care of him and then put him back in the wild!\" \"Brilliant!\" said Ron. \"How about it, Hagrid?\" And in the end, Hagrid agreed that they could send an owl to Charlie to ask him. The following week dragged by. Wednesday night found Hermione and Harry sitting alone in the common room, long after everyone else had gone to bed. The clock on the wall had just chimed midnight when the portrait hole burst open. Ron appeared out of nowhere as he pulled off Harry\\'s invisibility cloak. He had been down at Hagrid\\'s hut, helping him feed Norbert, who was now eating dead rats by the crate. \"It bit me!\" he said, showing them his hand, which was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief. \"I\\'m not going to be able to hold a quill for a week. I tell you, that dragon\\'s the most horrible animal I\\'ve ever met, but the way Hagrid goes on about it, you\\'d think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit. When it bit me he told me off for frightening it. And when I left, he was singing it a lullaby.\" There was a tap on the dark window. \"It\\'s Hedwig!\" said Harry, hurrying to let her in. \"She\\'ll have Charlie\\'s answer!\" The three of them put their heads together to read the note. Dear Ron, How are you? Thanks for the letter - I\\'d be glad to take the Norwegian Ridgeback, but it won\\'t be easy getting him here. I think the best thing will be to send him over with some friends of mine who are coming to visit me next week. Trouble is, they mustn\\'t be seen carrying an illegal dragon. Could you get the Ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on Saturday? They can meet you there and take him away while it\\'s still dark. Send me an answer as soon as possible. Love, Charlie They looked at one another. \"We\\'ve got the invisibility cloak,\" said Harry. \"It shouldn\\'t be too difficult Œ I think the cloaks big enough to cover two of us and Norbert.\" It was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two agreed with him. Anything to get rid of Norbert - and Malfoy. There was a hitch. By the next morning, Ron\\'s bitten hand had swollen to twice its usual size. He didn\\'t know whether it was safe to go to Madam Pomfrey - would she recognize a dragon bite? By the afternoon, though, he had no choice. The cut had turned a nasty shade of green. It looked as if Norbert\\'s fangs were poisonous. Harry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day to find Ron in a terrible state in bed. \"It\\'s not just my hand,\" he whispered, \"although that feels like it\\'s about to fall off. Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me. He kept threatening to tell her what really bit me - I\\'ve told her it was a dog, but I don\\'t think she believes me - I shouldn\\'t have hit him at the Quidditch match, that\\'s why he\\'s doing this.\" Harry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down. \"It\\'ll all be over at midnight on Saturday,\" said Hermione, but this didn\\'t soothe Ron at all. On the contrary, he sat bolt upright and broke into a sweat. \"Midnight on Saturday!\" he said in a hoarse voice. \"Oh no oh no - I\\'ve just remembered - Charlie\\'s letter was in that book Malfoy took, he\\'s going to know we\\'re getting rid of Norbert.\" Harry and Hermione didn\\'t get a chance to answer. Madam Pomfrey came over at that moment and made them leave, saying Ron needed sleep. \"It\\'s too late to change the plan now,\" Harry told Hermione. \"We haven\\'t got time to send Charlie another owl, and this could be our only chance to get rid of Norbert. We\\'ll have to risk it. And we have got the invisibility cloak, Malfoy doesn\\'t know about that.\" They found Fang, the boarhound, sitting outside with a bandaged tail when they went to tell Hagrid, who opened a window to talk to them. \"I won\\'t let you in,\" he puffed. \"Norbert\\'s at a tricky stage - nothin\\' I can\\'t handle.\" When they told him about Charlie\\'s letter, his eyes filled with tears, although that might have been because Norbert had just bitten him on the leg. \"Aargh! It\\'s all right, he only got my boot - jus\\' playin\\' - he\\'s only a baby, after all.\" The baby banged its tail on the wall, making the windows rattle. Harry and Hermione walked back to the castle feeling Saturday couldn\\'t come quickly enough. They would have felt sorry for Hagrid when the time came for him to say good-bye to Norbert if they hadn\\'t been so worried about what they had to do. It was a very dark, cloudy night, and they were a bit late arriving at Hagrid\\'s hut because they\\'d had to wait for Peeves to get out of their way in the entrance hall, where he\\'d been playing tennis against the wall. Hagrid had Norbert packed and ready in a large crate. \"He\\'s got lots o\\' rats an\\' some brandy fer the journey,\" said Hagrid in a muffled voice. \"An\\' I\\'ve packed his teddy bear in case he gets lonely.\" From inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to Harry as though the teddy was having his head torn off. \"Bye-bye, Norbert!\" Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and Hermione covered the crate with the invisibility cloak and stepped underneath it themselves. \"Mommy will never forget you!\" How they managed to get the crate back up to the castle, they never knew. Midnight ticked nearer as they heaved Norbert up the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors. Up another staircase, then another Œ even one of Harry\\'s shortcuts didn\\'t make the work much easier. \"Nearly there!\" Harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath the tallest tower. Then a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the crate. Forgetting that they were already invisible, they shrank into the shadows, staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each other ten feet away. A lamp flared. Professor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net, had Malfoy by the ear. \"Detention!\" she shouted. \"And twenty points from Slytherin! Wandering around in the middle of the night, how dare you - \" \"You don\\'t understand, Professor. Harry Potter\\'s coming - he\\'s got a dragon!\" \"What utter rubbish! How dare you tell such lies! Come on - I shall see Professor Snape about you, Malfoy!\" The steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest thing in the world after that. Not until they\\'d stepped out into the cold night air did they throw off the cloak, glad to be able to breathe properly again. Hermione did a sort of jig. \"Malfoy\\'s got detention! I could sing!\" \"Don\\'t,\" Harry advised her. Chuckling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbert thrashing about in his crate. About ten minutes later, four broomsticks came swooping down out of the darkness. Charlie\\'s friends were a cheery lot. They showed Harry and Hermione the harness they\\'d rigged up, so they could suspend Norbert between them. They all helped buckle Norbert safely into it and then Harry and Hermione shook hands with the others and thanked them very much. At last, Norbert was going– going– gone. They slipped back down the spiral staircase, their hearts as light as their hands, now that Norbert was off them. No more dragon - Malfoy in detention - what could spoil their happiness? The answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs. As they stepped into the corridor, Filch\\'s face loomed suddenly out of the darkness. \"Well, well, well,\" he whispered, \"we are in trouble.\" They\\'d left the invisibility cloak on top of the tower. CHAPTER FIFTEEN The Forbidden Forest Things couldn\\'t have been worse. Filch took them down to Professor McGonagall\\'s study on the first floor, where they sat and waited without saying a word to each other. Hermione was trembling. Excuses, alibis, and wild cover- up stories chased each other around Harry\\'s brain, each more feeble than the last. He couldn\\'t see how they were going to get out of trouble this time. They were cornered. How could they have been so stupid as to forget the cloak? There was no reason on earth that Professor McGonagall would accept for their being out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of night, let alone being up the tallest astronomy tower, which was out-of-bounds except for classes. Add Norbert and the invisibility cloak, and they might as well be packing their bags already. Had Harry thought that things couldn\\'t have been worse? He was wrong. When Professor McGonagall appeared, she was leading Neville. \"Harry!\" Neville burst out, the moment he saw the other two. \"I was trying to find you to warn you, I heard Malfoy saying he was going to catch you, he said you had a drag - \" Harry shook his head violently to shut Neville up, but Professor McGonagall had seen. She looked more likely to breathe fire than Norbert as she towered over the three of them. \"I would never have believed it of any of you. Mr. Filch says you were up in the astronomy tower. It\\'s one o\\'clock in the morning. Explain yourselves.\" It was the first time Hermione had ever failed to answer a teacher\\'s question. She was staring at her slippers, as still as a statue. \"I think I\\'ve got a good idea of what\\'s been going on,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"It doesn\\'t take a genius to work it out. You fed Draco Malfoy some cock-and-bull story about a dragon, trying to get him out of bed and into trouble. I\\'ve already caught him. I suppose you think it\\'s funny that Longbottom here heard the story and believed it, too?\" Harry caught Neville\\'s eye and tried to tell him without words that this wasn\\'t true, because Neville was looking stunned and hurt. Poor, blundering Neville - Harry knew what it must have cost him to try and find them in the dark, to warn them. \"I\\'m disgusted,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"Four students out of bed in one night! I\\'ve never heard of such a thing before! You, Miss Granger, I thought you had more sense. As for you, Mr. Potter, I thought Gryffindor meant more to you than this. All three of you will receive detentions - yes, you too, Mr. Longbottom, nothing gives you the right to walk around school at night, especially these days, it\\'s very dangerous - and fifty points will be taken from Gryffindor.\" \"Fifty?\" Harry gasped - they would lose the lead, the lead he\\'d won in the last Quidditch match. \"Fifty points each,\" said Professor McGonagall, breathing heavily through her long, pointed nose. \"Professor - please - \" \"You can\\'t - \" \"Don\\'t tell me what I can and can\\'t do, Potter. Now get back to bed, all of you. I\\'ve never been more ashamed of Gryffindor students.\" A hundred and fifty points lost. That put Gryffindor in last place. In one night, they\\'d ruined any chance Gryffindor had had for the house cup. Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach. How could they ever make up for this? Harry didn\\'t sleep all night. He could hear Neville sobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours. Harry couldn\\'t think of anything to say to comfort him. He knew Neville, like himself, was dreading the dawn. What would happen when the rest of Gryffindor found out what they\\'d done? At first, Gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that recorded the house points the next day thought there\\'d been a mistake. How could they suddenly have a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday? And then the story started to spread: Harry Potter, the famous Harry Potter, their hero of two Quidditch matches, had lost them all those points, him and a couple of other stupid first years. From being one of the most popular and admired people at the school, Harry was suddenly the most hated. Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs turned on him, because everyone had been longing to see Slytherin lose the house cup. Everywhere Harry went, people pointed and didn\\'t trouble to lower their voices as they insulted him. Slytherins, on the other hand, clapped as he walked past them, whistling and cheering, \"Thanks Potter, we owe you one!\" Only Ron stood by him. \"They\\'ll all forget this in a few weeks. Fred and George have lost loads of points in all the time they\\'ve been here, and people still like them.\" \"They\\'ve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go, though, have they?\" said Harry miserably. \"Well - no,\" Ron admitted. It was a bit late to repair the damage, but Harry swore to himself not to meddle in things that weren\\'t his business from now on. He\\'d had it with sneaking around and spying. He felt so ashamed of himself that he went to Wood and offered to resign from the Quidditch team. \"Resign?\" Wood thundered. \"What good\\'ll that do? How are we going to get any points back if we can\\'t win at Quidditch?\" But even Quidditch had lost its fun. The rest of the team wouldn\\'t speak to Harry during practice, and if they had to speak about him, they called him \"the Seeker.\" Hermione and Neville were suffering, too. They didn\\'t have as bad a time as Harry, because they weren\\'t as well-known, but nobody would speak to them, either. Hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in class, keeping her head down and working in silence. Harry was almost glad that the exams weren\\'t far away. All the studying he had to do kept his mind off his misery. He, Ron, and Hermione kept to themselves, working late into the night, trying to remember the ingredients in complicated potions, learn charms and spells by heart, memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions– Then, about a week before the exams were due to start, Harry\\'s new resolution not to interfere in anything that didn\\'t concern him was put to an unexpected test. Walking back from the library on his own one afternoon, he heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead. As he drew closer, he heard Quirrell\\'s voice. \"No - no - not again, please - \" It sounded as though someone was threatening him. Harry moved closer. \"All right - all right - \" he heard Quirrell sob. Next second, Quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom straightening his turban. He was pale and looked as though he was about to cry. He strode out of sight; Harry didn\\'t think Quirrell had even noticed him. He waited until Quirrell\\'s footsteps had disappeared, then peered into the classroom. It was empty, but a door stood ajar at the other end. Harry was halfway toward it before he remembered what he\\'d promised himself about not meddling. All the same, he\\'d have gambled twelve Sorcerer\\'s Stones that Snape had just left the room, and from what Harry had just heard, Snape would be walking with a new spring in his step - Quirrell seemed to have given in at last. Harry went back to the library, where Hermione was testing Ron on Astronomy. Harry told them what he\\'d heard. \"Snape\\'s done it, then!\" said Ron. \"If Quirrell\\'s told him how to break his Anti-Dark Force spell - \" \"There\\'s still Fluffy, though,\" said Hermione. \"Maybe Snape\\'s found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid,\" said Ron, looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them. \"I bet there\\'s a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant three-headed dog. So what do we do, Harry?\" The light of adventure was kindling again in Ron\\'s eyes, but Hermione answered before Harry could. \"Go to Dumbledore. That\\'s what we should have done ages ago. If we try anything ourselves we\\'ll be thrown out for sure.\" \"But we\\'ve got no proof!\" said Harry. \"Quirrell\\'s too scared to back us up. Snape\\'s only got to say he doesn\\'t know how the troll got in at Halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor - who do you think they\\'ll believe, him or us? It\\'s not exactly a secret we hate him, Dumbledore\\'ll think we made it up to get him sacked. Filch wouldn\\'t help us if his life depended on it, he\\'s too friendly with Snape, and the more students get thrown out, the better, he\\'ll think. And don\\'t forget, we\\'re not supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy. That\\'ll take a lot of explaining.\" Hermione looked convinced, but Ron didn\\'t. \"If we just do a bit of poking around - \" \"No,\" said Harry flatly, \"we\\'ve done enough poking around.\" He pulled a map of Jupiter toward him and started to learn the names of its moons. The following morning, notes were delivered to Harry, Hermione, and Neville at the breakfast table. They were all the same: Your detention will take place at eleven o\\'clock tonight. Meet Mr. Filch in the entrance hall. Professor McGonagall Harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furor over the points they\\'d lost. He half expected Hermione to complain that this was a whole night of studying lost, but she didn\\'t say a word. Like Harry, she felt they deserved what they\\'d got. At eleven o\\'clock that night, they said good-bye to Ron in the common room and went down to the entrance hall with Neville. Filch was already there - and so was Malfoy. Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy had gotten a detention, too. \"Follow me,\" said Filch, lighting a lamp and leading them outside. \"I bet you\\'ll think twice about breaking a school rule again, won\\'t you, eh?\" he said, leering at them. \"Oh yes– hard work and pain are the best teachers if you ask me– It\\'s just a pity they let the old punishments die out– hang you by your wrists from the ceiling for a few days, I\\'ve got the chains still in my office, keep ‚em well oiled in case they\\'re ever needed– Right, off we go, and don\\'t think of running off, now, it\\'ll be worse for you if you do.\" They marched off across the dark grounds. Neville kept sniffing. Harry wondered what their punishment was going to be. It must be something really horrible, or Filch wouldn\\'t be sounding so delighted. The moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them into darkness. Ahead, Harry could see the lighted windows of Hagrid\\'s hut. Then they heard a distant shout. \"Is that you, Filch? Hurry up, I want ter get started.\" Harry\\'s heart rose; if they were going to be working with Hagrid it wouldn\\'t be so bad. His relief must have showed in his face, because Filch said, \"I suppose you think you\\'ll be enjoying yourself with that oaf? Well, think again, boy - it\\'s into the forest you\\'re going and I\\'m much mistaken if you\\'ll all come out in one piece.\" At this, Neville let out a little moan, and Malfoy stopped dead in his tracks. \"The forest?\" he repeated, and he didn\\'t sound quite as cool as usual. \"We can\\'t go in there at night - there\\'s all sorts of things in there - werewolves, I heard.\" Neville clutched the sleeve of Harry\\'s robe and made a choking noise. \"That\\'s your problem, isn\\'t it?\" said Filch, his voice cracking with glee. \"Should\\'ve thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble, shouldn\\'t you?\" Hagrid came striding toward them out of the dark, Fang at his heel. He was carrying his large crossbow, and a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulder. \"Abou\\' time,\" he said. \"I bin waitin\\' fer half an hour already. All right, Harry, Hermione?\" \"I shouldn\\'t be too friendly to them, Hagrid,\" said Filch coldly, \"they\\'re here to be punished, after all.\" \"That\\'s why yer late, is it?\" said Hagrid, frowning at Filch. \"Bin lecturin\\' them, eh? ‚Snot your place ter do that. Yeh\\'ve done yer bit, I\\'ll take over from here.\" \"I\\'ll be back at dawn,\" said Filch, \"for what\\'s left of them,\" he added nastily, and he turned and started back toward the castle, his lamp bobbing away in the darkness. Malfoy now turned to Hagrid. \"I\\'m not going in that forest,\" he said, and Harry was pleased to hear the note of panic in his voice. \"Yeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts,\" said Hagrid fiercely. \"Yeh\\'ve done wrong an\\' now yeh\\'ve got ter pay fer it.\" \"But this is servant stuff, it\\'s not for students to do. I thought we\\'d be copying lines or something, if my father knew I was doing this, he\\'d - \" \" - tell yer that\\'s how it is at Hogwarts,\" Hagrid growled. \"Copyin\\' lines! What good\\'s that ter anyone? Yeh\\'ll do summat useful or yeh\\'ll get out. If yeh think yer father\\'d rather you were expelled, then get back off ter the castle an\\' pack. Go on.\" Malfoy didn\\'t move. He looked at Hagrid furiously, but then dropped his gaze. \"Right then,\" said Hagrid, \"now, listen carefully, ‚cause it\\'s dangerous what we\\'re gonna do tonight, an\\' I don\\' want no one takin\\' risks. Follow me over here a moment.\" He led them to the very edge of the forest. Holding his lamp up high, he pointed down a narrow, winding earth track that disappeared into the thick black trees. A light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into the forest. \"Look there,\" said Hagrid, \"see that stuff shinin\\' on the ground? Silvery stuff? That\\'s unicorn blood. There\\'s a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat. This is the second time in a week. I found one dead last Wednesday. We\\'re gonna try an\\' find the poor thing. We might have ter put it out of its misery.\" \"And what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first?\" said Malfoy, unable to keep the fear out of his voice. \"There\\'s nothin\\' that lives in the forest that\\'ll hurt yeh if yer with me or Fang,\" said Hagrid. \"An\\' keep ter the path. Right, now, we\\'re gonna split inter two parties an\\' follow the trail in diff\\'rent directions. There\\'s blood all over the place, it must\\'ve bin staggerin\\' around since last night at least.\" \"I want Fang,\" said Malfoy quickly, looking at Fang\\'s long teeth. \"All right, but I warn yeh, he\\'s a coward,\" said Hagrid. \"So me, Harry, an\\' Hermione\\'ll go one way an\\' Draco, Neville, an\\' Fang\\'ll go the other. Now, if any of us finds the unicorn, we\\'ll send up green sparks, right? Get yer wands out an\\' practice now - that\\'s it - an\\' if anyone gets in trouble, send up red sparks, an\\' we\\'ll all come an\\' find yeh - so, be careful - let\\'s go.\" The forest was black and silent. A little way into it they reached a fork in the earth path, and Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid took the left path while Malfoy, Neville, and Fang took the right. They walked in silence, their eyes on the ground. Every now and then a ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silver-blue blood on the fallen leaves. Harry saw that Hagrid looked very worried. \"Could a werewolf be killing the unicorns?\" Harry asked. \"Not fast enough,\" said Hagrid. \"It\\'s not easy ter catch a unicorn, they\\'re powerful magic creatures. I never knew one ter be hurt before.\" They walked past a mossy tree stump. Harry could hear running water; there must be a stream somewhere close by. There were still spots of unicorn blood here and there along the winding path. \"You all right, Hermione?\" Hagrid whispered. \"Don\\' worry, it can\\'t\\'ve gone far if it\\'s this badly hurt, an\\' then we\\'ll be able ter - GET BEHIND THAT TREE!\" Hagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted them off the path behind a towering oak. He pulled out an arrow and fitted it into his crossbow, raising it, ready to fire. The three of them listened. Something was slithering over dead leaves nearby: it sounded like a cloak trailing along the ground. Hagrid was squinting up the dark path, but after a few seconds, the sound faded away. \"I knew it,\" he murmured. \"There\\'s summat in here that shouldn\\' be.\" \"A werewolf?\" Harry suggested. \"That wasn\\' no werewolf an\\' it wasn\\' no unicorn, neither,\" said Hagrid grimly. \"Right, follow me, but careful, now.\" They walked more slowly, ears straining for the faintest sound. Suddenly, in a clearing ahead, something definitely moved. \"Who\\'s there?\" Hagrid called. \"Show yerself - I\\'m armed!\" And into the clearing came - was it a man, or a horse? To the waist, a man, with red hair and beard, but below that was a horse\\'s gleaming chestnut body with a long, reddish tail. Harry and Hermione\\'s jaws dropped. \"Oh, it\\'s you, Ronan,\" said Hagrid in relief. \"How are yeh?\" He walked forward and shook the centaur\\'s hand. \"Good evening to you, Hagrid,\" said Ronan. He had a deep, sorrowful voice. \"Were you going to shoot me?\" \"Can\\'t be too careful, Ronan,\" said Hagrid, patting his crossbow. \"There\\'s summat bad loose in this forest. This is Harry Potter an\\' Hermione Granger, by the way. Students up at the school. An\\' this is Ronan, you two. He\\'s a centaur. \"We\\'d noticed,\" said Hermione faintly. \"Good evening,\" said Ronan. \"Students, are you? And do you learn much, up at the school?\" \"Erm - \" \"A bit,\" said Hermione timidly. \"A bit. Well, that\\'s something.\" Ronan sighed. He flung back his head and stared at the sky. \"Mars is bright tonight.\" \"Yeah,\" said Hagrid, glancing up, too. \"Listen, I\\'m glad we\\'ve run inter yeh, Ronan, ‚cause there\\'s a unicorn bin hurt - you seen anythin\\'?\" Ronan didn\\'t answer immediately. He stared unblinkingly upward, then sighed again. \"Always the innocent are the first victims,\" he said. \"So it has been for ages past, so it is now.\" \"Yeah,\" said Hagrid, \"but have yeh seen anythin\\' Ronan? Anythin\\' unusual?\" \"Mars is bright tonight,\" Ronan repeated, while Hagrid watched him impatiently. \"Unusually bright.\" \"Yeah, but I was meanin\\' anythin\\' unusual a bit nearer home,\" said Hagrid. \"So yeh haven\\'t noticed anythin\\' strange?\" Yet again, Ronan took a while to answer. At last, he said, \"The forest hides many secrets.\" A movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid raise his bow again, but it was only a second centaur, black-haired and - bodied and wilder-looking than Ronan. \"Hullo, Bane,\" said Hagrid. \"All right?\" \"Good evening, Hagrid, I hope you are well?\" \"Well enough. Look, I\\'ve jus\\' bin askin\\' Ronan, you seen anythin\\' odd in here lately? There\\'s a unicorn bin injured - would yeh know anythin\\' about it?\" Bane walked over to stand next to Ronan. He looked skyward. \"Mars is bright tonight,\" he said simply. \"We\\'ve heard,\" said Hagrid grumpily. \"Well, if either of you do see anythin\\', let me know, won\\'t yeh? We\\'ll be off, then.\" Harry and Hermione followed him out of the clearing, staring over their shoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked their view. \"Never,\" said Hagrid irritably, \"try an\\' get a straight answer out of a centaur. Ruddy stargazers. Not interested in anythin\\' closer\\'n the moon.\" \"Are there many of them in here?\" asked Hermione. \"Oh, a fair few– Keep themselves to themselves mostly, but they\\'re good enough about turnin\\' up if ever I want a word. They\\'re deep, mind, centaurs– they know things– jus\\' don\\' let on much.\" \"D\\'you think that was a centaur we heard earlier?\" said Harry. \"Did that sound like hooves to you? Nah, if yeh ask me, that was what\\'s bin killin\\' the unicorns Œ never heard anythin\\' like it before.\" They walked on through the dense, dark trees. Harry kept looking nervously over his shoulder. He had the nasty feeling they were being watched. He was very glad they had Hagrid and his crossbow with them. They had just passed a bend in the path when Hermione grabbed Hagrid\\'s arm. \"Hagrid! Look! Red sparks, the others are in trouble!\" \"You two wait here!\" Hagrid shouted. \"Stay on the path, I\\'ll come back for yeh!\" They heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood looking at each other, very scared, until they couldn\\'t hear anything but the rustling of leaves around them. \"You don\\'t think they\\'ve been hurt, do you?\" whispered Hermione. \"I don\\'t care if Malfoy has, but if something\\'s got Neville– it\\'s our fault he\\'s here in the first place.\" The minutes dragged by. Their ears seemed sharper than usual. Harry\\'s seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind, every cracking twig. What was going on? Where were the others? At last, a great crunching noise announced Hagrid\\'s return. Malfoy, Neville, and Fang were with him. Hagrid was fuming. Malfoy, it seemed, had sneaked up behind Neville and grabbed him as a joke. Neville had panicked and sent up the sparks. \"We\\'ll be lucky ter catch anythin\\' now, with the racket you two were makin\\'. Right, we\\'re changin\\' groups - Neville, you stay with me an\\' Hermione, Harry, you go with Fang an\\' this idiot. I\\'m sorry,\" Hagrid added in a whisper to Harry, \"but he\\'ll have a harder time frightenin\\' you, an\\' we\\'ve gotta get this done.\" So Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy and Fang. They walked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into the forest, until the path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so thick. Harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker. There were splashes on the roots of a tree, as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by. Harry could see a clearing ahead, through the tangled branches of an ancient oak. \"Look - \" he murmured, holding out his arm to stop Malfoy. Something bright white was gleaming on the ground. They inched closer. It was the unicorn all right, and it was dead. Harry had never seen anything so beautiful and sad. Its long, slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly-white on the dark leaves. Harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him freeze where he stood. A bush on the edge of the clearing quivered– Then, out of the shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast. Harry, Malfoy, and Fang stood transfixed. The cloaked figure reached the unicorn, lowered its head over the wound in the animal\\'s side, and began to drink its blood. \"AAAAAAAAAARGH!\" Malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted - so did Fang. The hooded figure raised its head and looked right at Harry - unicorn blood was dribbling down its front. It got to its feet and came swiftly toward Harry - he couldn\\'t move for fear. Then a pain like he\\'d never felt before pierced his head; it was as though his scar were on fire. Half blinded, he staggered backward. He heard hooves behind him, galloping, and something jumped clean over Harry, charging at the figure. The pain in Harry\\'s head was so bad he fell to his knees. It took a minute or two to pass. When he looked up, the figure had gone. A centaur was standing over him, not Ronan or Bane; this one looked younger; he had white-blond hair and a palomino body. \"Are you all right?\" said the centaur, pulling Harry to his feet. \"Yes - thank you - what was that?\" The centaur didn\\'t answer. He had astonishingly blue eyes, like pale sapphires. He looked carefully at Harry, his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out, livid, on Harry\\'s forehead. \"You are the Potter boy,\" he said. \"You had better get back to Hagrid. The forest is not safe at this time - especially for you. Can you ride? It will be quicker this way. \"My name is Firenze,\" he added, as he lowered himself on to his front legs so that Harry could clamber onto his back. There was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing. Ronan and Bane came bursting through the trees, their flanks heaving and sweaty. \"Firenze!\" Bane thundered. \"What are you doing? You have a human on your back! Have you no shame? Are you a common mule?\" \"Do you realize who this is?\" said Firenze. \"This is the Potter boy. The quicker he leaves this forest, the better.\" \"What have you been telling him?\" growled Bane. \"Remember, Firenze, we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens. Have we not read what is to come in the movements of the planets?\" Ronan pawed the ground nervously. \"I\\'m sure Firenze thought he was acting for the best,\" he said in his gloomy voice. Bane kicked his back legs in anger. \"For the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold! It is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest!\" Firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, so that Harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on. \"Do you not see that unicorn?\" Firenze bellowed at Bane. \"Do you not understand why it was killed? Or have the planets not let you in on that secret? I set myself against what is lurking in this forest, Bane, yes, with humans alongside me if I must.\" And Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on as best he could, they plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane behind them. Harry didn\\'t have a clue what was going on. \"Why\\'s Bane so angry?\" he asked. \"What was that thing you saved me from, anyway?\" Firenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep his head bowed in case of low-hanging branches, but did not answer Harry\\'s question. They made their way through the trees in silence for so long that Harry thought Firenze didn\\'t want to talk to him anymore. They were passing through a particularly dense patch of trees, however, when Firenze suddenly stopped. \"Harry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used for?\" \"No,\" said Harry, startled by the odd question. \"We\\'ve only used the horn and tail hair in Potions.\" \"That is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn,\" said Firenze. \"Only one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a crime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price. You have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself, and you will have but a half-life, a cursed life, from the moment the blood touches your lips.\" Harry stared at the back of Firenze\\'s head, which was dappled silver in the moonlight. \"But who\\'d be that desperate?\" he wondered aloud. \"If you\\'re going to be cursed forever, death\\'s better, isn\\'t it?\" \"It is,\" Firenze agreed, \"unless all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something else - something that will bring you back to full strength and power - something that will mean you can never die. Mr. Potter, do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?\" \"The Sorcerer\\'s Stone! Of course - the Elixir of Life! But I don\\'t understand who - \" \"Can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power, who has clung to life, awaiting their chance?\" It was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around Harry\\'s heart. Over the rustling of the trees, he seemed to hear once more what Hagrid had told him on the night they had met: \"Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die.\" \"Do you mean,\" Harry croaked, \"that was Vol- \" \"Harry! Harry, are you all right?\" Hermione was running toward them down the path, Hagrid puffing along behind her. \"I\\'m fine,\" said Harry, hardly knowing what he was saying. \"The unicorn\\'s dead, Hagrid, it\\'s in that clearing back there.\" \"This is where I leave you,\" Firenze murmured as Hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn. \"You are safe now.\" Harry slid off his back. \"Good luck, Harry Potter,\" said Firenze. \"The planets have been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope this is one of those times.\" He turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest, leaving Harry shivering behind him. Ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room, waiting for them to return. He shouted something about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook him awake. In a matter of seconds, though, he was wide-eyed as Harry began to tell him and Hermione what had happened in the forest. Harry couldn\\'t sit down. He paced up and down in front of the fire. He was still shaking. \"Snape wants the stone for Voldemort– and Voldemort\\'s waiting in the forest– and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get rich–\" \"Stop saying the name!\" said Ron in a terrified whisper, as if he thought Voldemort could hear them. Harry wasn\\'t listening. \"Firenze saved me, but he shouldn\\'t have done so– Bane was furious– he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happen– They must show that Voldemort\\'s coming back– Bane thinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me– I suppose that\\'s written in the stars as well.\" \"Will you stop saying the name!\" Ron hissed. \"So all I\\'ve got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone,\" Harry went on feverishly, \"then Voldemort will be able to come and finish me off– Well, I suppose Bane\\'ll be happy.\" Hermione looked very frightened, but she had a word of comfort. \"Harry, everyone says Dumbledore\\'s the only one You-Know-Who was ever afraid of, with Dumbledore around, You-Know-Who won\\'t touch you. Anyway, who says the centaurs are right? It sounds like fortune-telling to me, and Professor McGonagall says that\\'s a very imprecise branch of magic.\" The sky had turned light before they stopped talking. They went to bed exhausted, their throats sore. But the night\\'s surprises weren\\'t over. When Harry pulled back his sheets, he found his invisibility cloak folded neatly underneath them. There was a note pinned to it: Just in case. CHAPTER SIXTEEN Through the Trapdoor In years to come, Harry would never quite remember how he had managed to get through his exams when he half expected Voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment. Yet the days crept by, and there could be no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door. It was sweltering hot, especially in the large classroom where they did their written papers. They had been given special, new quills for the exams, which had been bewitched with an Anticheating spell. They had practical exams as well. Professor Flitwick called them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance across a desk. Professor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox - points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers. Snape made them all nervous, breathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion. Harry did the best he could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his forehead, which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest. Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because Harry couldn\\'t sleep, but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by his old nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it. Maybe it was because they hadn\\'t seen what Harry had seen in the forest, or because they didn\\'t have scars burning on their foreheads, but Ron and Hermione didn\\'t seem as worried about the Stone as Harry. The idea of Voldemort certainly scared them, but he didn\\'t keep visiting them in dreams, and they were so busy with their studying they didn\\'t have much time to fret about what Snape or anyone else might be up to. Their very last exam was History of Magic. One hour of answering questions about batty old wizards who\\'d invented selfstirring cauldrons and they\\'d be free, free for a whole wonderful week until their exam results came out. When the ghost of Professor Binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their parchment, Harry couldn\\'t help cheering with the rest. \"That was far easier than I thought it would be,\" said Hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds. \"I needn\\'t have learned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Elfric the Eager.\" Hermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward, but Ron said this made him feel ill, so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under a tree. The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was basking in the warm shallows. \"No more studying,\" Ron sighed happily, stretching out on the grass. \"You could look more cheerful, Harry, we\\'ve got a week before we find out how badly we\\'ve done, there\\'s no need to worry yet.\" Harry was rubbing his forehead. \"I wish I knew what this means!\" he burst out angrily. \"My scar keeps hurting - it\\'s happened before, but never as often as this.\" \"Go to Madam Pomfrey,\" Hermione suggested. \"I\\'m not ill,\" said Harry. \"I think it\\'s a warning– it means danger\\'s coming–\" Ron couldn\\'t get worked up, it was too hot. \"Harry, relax, Hermione\\'s right, the Stone\\'s safe as long as Dumbledore\\'s around. Anyway, we\\'ve never had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy. He nearly had his leg ripped off once, he\\'s not going to try it again in a hurry. And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.\" Harry nodded, but he couldn\\'t shake off a lurking feeling that there was something he\\'d forgotten to do, something important. When he tried to explain this, Hermione said, \"That\\'s just the exams. I woke up last night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered we\\'d done that one.\" Harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn\\'t have anything to do with work, though. He watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky, a note clamped in its mouth. Hagrid was the only one who ever sent him letters. Hagrid would never betray Dumbledore. Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy– never– but– Harry suddenly jumped to his feet. \"Where\\'re you going?\" said Ron sleepily. \"I\\'ve just thought of something,\" said Harry. He had turned white. \"We\\'ve got to go and see Hagrid, now.\" \"Why?\" panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up. \"Don\\'t you think it\\'s a bit odd,\" said Harry, scrambling up the grassy slope, \"that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon, and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket? How many people wander around with dragon eggs if it\\'s against wizard law? Lucky they found Hagrid, don\\'t you think? Why didn\\'t I see it before?\" \"What are you talking about?\" said Ron, but Harry, sprinting across the grounds toward the forest, didn\\'t answer. Hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house; his trousers and sleeves were rolled up, and he was shelling peas into a large bowl. \"Hullo,\" he said, smiling. \"Finished yer exams? Got time fer a drink?\" \"Yes, please,\" said Ron, but Harry cut him off. \"No, we\\'re in a hurry. Hagrid, I\\'ve got to ask you something. You know that night you won Norbert? What did the stranger you were playing cards with look like?\" \"Dunno,\" said Hagrid casually, \"he wouldn\\' take his cloak off.\" He saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows. \"It\\'s not that unusual, yeh get a lot o\\' funny folk in the Hog\\'s Head - that\\'s one of the pub down in the village. Mighta bin a dragon dealer, mightn\\' he? I never saw his face, he kept his hood up.\" Harry sank down next to the bowl of peas. \"What did you talk to him about, Hagrid? Did you mention Hogwarts at all?\" \"Mighta come up,\" said Hagrid, frowning as he tried to remember. \"Yeah– he asked what I did, an\\' I told him I was gamekeeper here– He asked a bit about the sorta creatures I took after– so I told him– an\\' I said what I\\'d always really wanted was a dragon– an\\' then– I can\\' remember too well, ‚cause he kept buyin\\' me drinks– Let\\'s see– yeah, then he said he had the dragon egg an\\' we could play cards fer it if I wanted– but he had ter be sure I could handle it, he didn\\' want it ter go ter any old home– So I told him, after Fluffy, a dragon would be easy–\" \"And did he - did he seem interested in Fluffy?\" Harry asked, trying to keep his voice calm. \"Well - yeah - how many three-headed dogs d\\'yeh meet, even around Hogwarts? So I told him, Fluffy\\'s a piece o\\' cake if yeh know how to calm him down, jus\\' play him a bit o\\' music an\\' he\\'ll go straight off ter sleep - \" Hagrid suddenly looked horrified. \"I shouldn\\'ta told yeh that!\" he blurted out. \"Forget I said it! Hey - where\\'re yeh goin\\'?\" Harry, Ron, and Hermione didn\\'t speak to each other at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds. \"We\\'ve got to go to Dumbledore,\" said Harry. \"Hagrid told that stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak - it must\\'ve been easy, once he\\'d got Hagrid drunk. I just hope Dumbledore believes us. Firenze might back us up if Bane doesn\\'t stop him. Where\\'s Dumbledore\\'s office?\" They looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right direction. They had never been told where Dumbledore lived, nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see him. \"We\\'ll just have to - \" Harry began, but a voice suddenly rang across the hall. \"What are you three doing inside?\" It was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of books. \"We want to see Professor Dumbledore,\" said Hermione, rather bravely, Harry and Ron thought. \"See Professor Dumbledore?\" Professor McGonagall repeated, as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do. \"Why?\" Harry swallowed - now what? \"It\\'s sort of secret,\" he said, but he wished at once he hadn\\'t, because Professor McGonagall\\'s nostrils flared. \"Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,\" she said coldly. \"He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for London at once.\" \"He\\'s gone?\" said Harry frantically. \"Now?\" \"Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, he has many demands on his time Œ \" \"But this is important.\" \"Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic, Potter?\" \"Look,\" said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, \"Professor - it\\'s about the Sorcerer\\'s Stone - \" Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it wasn\\'t that. The books she was carrying tumbled out of her arms, but she didn\\'t pick them up. \"How do you know - ?\" she spluttered. \"Professor, I think - I know - that Sn - that someone\\'s going to try and steal the Stone. I\\'ve got to talk to Professor Dumbledore.\" She eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion. \"Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,\" she said finally. \"I don\\'t know how you found out about the Stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly steal it, it\\'s too well protected.\" \"But Professor - \" \"Potter, I know what I\\'m talking about,\" she said shortly. She bent down and gathered up the fallen books. \"I suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the sunshine.\" But they didn\\'t. \"It\\'s tonight,\" said Harry, once he was sure Professor McGonagall was out of earshot. \"Snape\\'s going through the trapdoor tonight. He\\'s found out everything he needs, and now he\\'s got Dumbledore out of the way. He sent that note, I bet the Ministry of Magic will get a real shock when Dumbledore turns up.\" \"But what can we - \" Hermione gasped. Harry and Ron wheeled round. Snape was standing there. \"Good afternoon,\" he said smoothly. They stared at him. \"You shouldn\\'t be inside on a day like this,\" he said, with an odd, twisted smile. \"We were - \" Harry began, without any idea what he was going to say. \"You want to be more careful,\" said Snape. \"Hanging around like this, people will think you\\'re up to something. And Gryffindor really can\\'t afford to lose any more points, can it?\" Harry flushed. They turned to go outside, but Snape called them back. \"Be warned, Potter - any more nighttime wanderings and I will personally make sure you are expelled. Good day to you.\" He strode off in the direction of the staffroom. Out on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others. \"Right, here\\'s what we\\'ve got to do,\" he whispered urgently. \"One of us has got to keep an eye on Snape - wait outside the staff room and follow him if he leaves it. Hermione, you\\'d better do that.\" \"Why me?\" \"It\\'s obvious,\" said Ron. \"You can pretend to be waiting for Professor Flitwick, you know.\" He put on a high voice, \"‚Oh Professor Flitwick, I\\'m so worried, I think I got question fourteen b wrong– \\'\" \"Oh, shut up,\" said Hermione, but she agreed to go and watch out for Snape. \"And we\\'d better stay outside the third-floor corridor,\" Harry told Ron. \"Come on.\" But that part of the plan didn\\'t work. No sooner had they reached the door separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than Professor McGonagall turned up again and this time, she lost her temper. \"I suppose you think you\\'re harder to get past than a pack of enchantments!\" she stormed. \"Enough of this nonsense! If I hear you\\'ve come anywhere near here again, I\\'ll take another fifty points from Gryffindor! Yes, Weasley, from my own house!\" Harry and Ron went back to the common room, Harry had just said, \"At least Hermione\\'s on Snape\\'s tail,\" when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came in. \"I\\'m sorry, Harry!\" she wailed. \"Snape came out and asked me what I was doing, so I said I was waiting for Flitwick, and Snape went to get him, and I\\'ve only just got away, I don\\'t know where Snape went.\" \"Well, that\\'s it then, isn\\'t it?\" Harry said. The other two stared at him. He was pale and his eyes were glittering. \"I\\'m going out of here tonight and I\\'m going to try and get to the Stone first.\" \"You\\'re mad!\" said Ron. \"You can\\'t!\" said Hermione. \"After what McGonagall and Snape have said? You\\'ll be expelled!\" \"SO WHAT\" Harry shouted. \"Don\\'t you understand? If Snape gets hold of the Stone, Voldemort\\'s coming back! Haven\\'t you heard what it was like when he was trying to take over? There won\\'t be any Hogwarts to get expelled from! He\\'ll flatten it, or turn it into a school for the Dark Arts! Losing points doesn\\'t matter anymore, can\\'t you see? D\\'you think he\\'ll leave you and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the house cup? If I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well, I\\'ll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there, it\\'s only dying a bit later than I would have, because I\\'m never going over to the Dark Side! I\\'m going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me! Voldemort killed my parents, remember?\" He glared at them. \"You\\'re right Harry,\" said Hermione in a small voice. \"I\\'ll use the invisibility cloak,\" said Harry. \"It\\'s just lucky I got it back.\" \"But will it cover all three of us?\" said Ron. \"All - all three of us?\" \"Oh, come off it, you don\\'t think we\\'d let you go alone?\" \"Of course not,\" said Hermione briskly. \"How do you think you\\'d get to the Stone without us? I\\'d better go and look through my books, there might be something useful–\" \"But if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too.\" \"Not if I can help it,\" said Hermione grimly. \"Flitwick told me in secret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam. They\\'re not throwing me out after that.\" After dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room. Nobody bothered them; none of the Gryffindors had anything to say to Harry any more, after all. This was the first night he hadn\\'t been upset by it. Hermione was skimming through all her notes, hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break. Harry and Ron didn\\'t talk much. Both of them were thinking about what they were about to do. Slowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed. \"Better get the cloak,\" Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan finally left, stretching and yawning. Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory. He pulled out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had given him for Christmas. He pocketed it to use on Fluffy - he didn\\'t feel much like singing. He ran back down to the common room. \"We\\'d better put the cloak on here, and make sure it covers all three of us Œ if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own - \" \"What are you doing?\" said a voice from the corner of the room. Neville appeared from behind an armchair, clutching Trevor the toad, who looked as though he\\'d been making another bid for freedom. \"Nothing, Neville, nothing,\" said Harry, hurriedly putting the cloak behind his back. Neville stared at their guilty faces. \"You\\'re going out again,\" he said. \"No, no, no,\" said Hermione. \"No, we\\'re not. Why don\\'t you go to bed, Neville?\" Harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door. They couldn\\'t afford to waste any more time, Snape might even now be playing Fluffy to sleep. \"You can\\'t go out,\" said Neville, \"you\\'ll be caught again. Gryffindor will be in even more trouble.\" \"You don\\'t understand,\" said Harry, \"this is important.\" But Neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate. \"I won\\'t let you do it,\" he said, hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole. \"I\\'ll - I\\'ll fight you!\" \"Neville, \"Ron exploded, \"get away from that hole and don\\'t be an idiot - \" \"Don\\'t you call me an idiot!\" said Neville. \"I don\\'t think you should be breaking any more rules! And you were the one who told me to stand up to people!\" \"Yes, but not to us,\" said Ron in exasperation. \"Neville, you don\\'t know what you\\'re doing.\" He took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the toad, who leapt out of sight. \"Go on then, try and hit me!\" said Neville, raising his fists. \"I\\'m ready!\" Harry turned to Hermione. \"Do something,\" he said desperately. Hermione stepped forward. \"Neville,\" she said, \"I\\'m really, really sorry about this.\" She raised her wand. \"Petrificus Totalus!\" she cried, pointing it at Neville. Neville\\'s arms snapped to his sides. His legs sprang together. His whole body rigid, he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face, stiff as a board. Hermione ran to turn him over. Neville\\'s jaws were jammed together so he couldn\\'t speak. Only his eyes were moving, looking at them in horror. \"What\\'ve you done to him?\" Harry whispered. \"It\\'s the full Body-Bind,\" said Hermione miserably. \"Oh, Neville, I\\'m so sorry.\" \"We had to, Neville, no time to explain,\" said Harry. \"You\\'ll understand later, Neville,\" said Ron as they stepped over him and pulled on the invisibility cloak. But leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn\\'t feel like a very good omen. In their nervous state, every statue\\'s shadow looked like Filch, every distant breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping down on them. At the foot of the first set of stairs, they spotted Mrs. Norris skulking near the top. \"Oh, let\\'s kick her, just this once,\" Ron whispered in Harry\\'s ear, but Harry shook his head. As they climbed carefully around her, Mrs. Norris turned her lamplike eyes on them, but didn\\'t do anything. They didn\\'t meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the third floor. Peeves was bobbing halfway up, loosening the carpet so that people would trip. \"Who\\'s there?\" he said suddenly as they climbed toward him. He narrowed his wicked black eyes. \"Know you\\'re there, even if I can\\'t see you. Are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?\" He rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at them. \"Should call Filch, I should, if something\\'s a-creeping around unseen.\" Harry had a sudden idea. \"Peeves,\" he said, in a hoarse whisper, \"the Bloody Baron has his own reasons for being invisible.\" Peeves almost fell out of the air in shock. He caught himself in time and hovered about a foot off the stairs. \"So sorry, your bloodiness, Mr. Baron, Sir,\" he said greasily. \"My mistake, my mistake - I didn\\'t see you - of course I didn\\'t, you\\'re invisible - forgive old Peevsie his little joke, sir.\" \"I have business here, Peeves,\" croaked Harry. \"Stay away from this place tonight.\" \"I will, sir, I most certainly will,\" said Peeves, rising up in the air again. \"Hope your business goes well, Baron, I\\'ll not bother you.\" And he scooted off. \"Brilliant, Harry!\" whispered Ron. A few seconds later, they were there, outside the third-floor corridor - and the door was already ajar. \"Well, there you are,\" Harry said quietly, \"Snape\\'s already got past Fluffy.\" Seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what was facing them. Underneath the cloak, Harry turned to the other two. \"If you want to go back, I won\\'t blame you,\" he said. \"You can take the cloak, I won\\'t need it now.\" \"Don\\'t be stupid,\" said Ron. \"We\\'re coming,\" said Hermione. Harry pushed the door open. As the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears. All three of the dog\\'s noses sniffed madly in their direction, even though it couldn\\'t see them. \"What\\'s that at its feet?\" Hermione whispered. \"Looks like a harp,\" said Ron. \"Snape must have left it there.\" \"It must wake up the moment you stop playing,\" said Harry. \"Well, here goes–\" He put Hagrid\\'s flute to his lips and blew. It wasn\\'t really a tune, but from the first note the beast\\'s eyes began to droop. Harry hardly drew breath. Slowly, the dog\\'s growls ceased - it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep. \"Keep playing,\" Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor. They could feel the dog\\'s hot, smelly breath as they approached the giant heads. \"I think we\\'ll be able to pull the door open,\" said Ron, peering over the dog\\'s back. \"Want to go first, Hermione?\" \"No, I don\\'t!\" \"All right.\" Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog\\'s legs. He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and open. \"What can you see?\" Hermione said anxiously. \"Nothing - just black - there\\'s no way of climbing down, we\\'ll just have to drop.\" Harry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Ron to get his attention and pointed at himself. \"You want to go first? Are you sure?\" said Ron. \"I don\\'t know how deep this thing goes. Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep.\" Harry handed the flute over. In the few seconds\\' silence, the dog growled and twitched, but the moment Hermione began to play, it fell back into its deep sleep. Harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor. There was no sign of the bottom. He lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his fingertips. Then he looked up at Ron and said, \"If anything happens to me, don\\'t follow. Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, right?\" \"Right,\" said Ron. \"See you in a minute, I hope–\" And Harry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past him as he fell down, down, down and - FLUMP. With a funny, muffled sort of thump he landed on something soft. He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the gloom. It felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant. \"It\\'s okay!\" he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, which was the open trapdoor, \"it\\'s a soft landing, you can jump!\" Ron followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to Harry. \"What\\'s this stuff?\" were his first words. \"Dunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it\\'s here to break the fall. Come on, Hermione!\" The distant music stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, but Hermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry\\'s other side. \"We must be miles under the school,\" she said. \"Lucky this plant thing\\'s here, really,\" said Ron. \"Lucky!\" shrieked Hermione. \"Look at you both!\" She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing. Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on her. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster the plant wound around them. \"Stop moving!\" Hermione ordered them. \"I know what this is - it\\'s Devil\\'s Snare!\" \"Oh, I\\'m so glad we know what it\\'s called, that\\'s a great help,\" snarled Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck. \"Shut up, I\\'m trying to remember how to kill it!\" said Hermione. \"Well, hurry up, I can\\'t breathe!\" Harry gasped, wrestling with it as it curled around his chest. \"Devil\\'s Snare, Devil\\'s Snare– what did Professor Sprout say? - it likes the dark and the damp.\" \"So light a fire!\" Harry choked. \"Yes - of course - but there\\'s no wood!\" Hermione cried, wringing her hands. \"HAVE YOU GONE MAD?\" Ron bellowed. \"ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?\" \"Oh, right!\" said Hermione, and she whipped out her wand, waved it, muttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on Snape at the plant. In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth. Wriggling and flailing, it unraveled itself from their bodies, and they were able to pull free. \"Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,\" said Harry as he joined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face. \"Yeah,\" said Ron, \"and lucky Harry doesn\\'t lose his head in a crisis - ‚there\\'s no wood,\\' honestly.\" \"This way,\" said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was the only way forward. All they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water trickling down the walls. The passageway sloped downward, and Harry was reminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant jolt of the heart, he remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards\\' bank. If they met a dragon, a fully-grown dragon - Norbert had been bad enough– \"Can you hear something?\" Ron whispered. Harry listened. A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up ahead. \"Do you think it\\'s a ghost?\" \"I don\\'t know– sounds like wings to me.\" \"There\\'s light ahead - I can see something moving.\" They reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling arching high above them. It was full of small, jewel-bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the room. On the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door. \"Do you think they\\'ll attack us if we cross the room?\" said Ron. \"Probably,\" said Harry. \"They don\\'t look very vicious, but I suppose if they all swooped down at once– well, there\\'s no other choice– I\\'ll run.\" He took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, and sprinted across the room. He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second, but nothing happened. He reached the door untouched. He pulled the handle, but it was locked. The other two followed him. They tugged and heaved at the door, but it wouldn\\'t budge, not even when Hermione tried her Alohomora charm. \"Now what?\" said Ron. \"These birds– they can\\'t be here just for decoration,\" said Hermione. They watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering - glittering? \"They\\'re not birds!\" Harry said suddenly. \"They\\'re keys! Winged keys - look carefully. So that must mean–\" he looked around the chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of keys. \"– yes - look! Broomsticks! We\\'ve got to catch the key to the door!\" \"But there are hundreds of them!\" Ron examined the lock on the door. \"We\\'re looking for a big, old-fashioned one - probably silver, like the handle.\" They each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air, soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys. They grabbed and snatched, but the bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one. Not for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century. He had a knack for spotting things other people didn\\'t. After a minute\\'s weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole. \"That one!\" he called to the others. \"That big one - there - no, there - with bright blue wings - the feathers are all crumpled on one side.\" Ron went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing, crashed into the ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom. \"We\\'ve got to close in on it!\" Harry called, not taking his eyes off the key with the damaged wing. \"Ron, you come at it from above - Hermione, stay below and stop it from going down and I\\'ll try and catch it. Right, NOW!\" Ron dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and Harry streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and with a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone with one hand. Ron and Hermione\\'s cheers echoed around the high chamber. They landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in his hand. He rammed it into the lock and turned Œ it worked. The moment the lock had clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very battered now that it had been caught twice. \"Ready?\" Harry asked the other two, his hand on the door handle. They nodded. He pulled the door open. The next chamber was so dark they couldn\\'t see anything at all. But as they stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight. They were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black chessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black stone. Facing them, way across the chamber, were the white pieces. Harry, Ron and Hermione shivered slightly Œ the towering white chessmen had no faces. \"Now what do we do?\" Harry whispered. \"It\\'s obvious, isn\\'t it?\" said Ron. \"We\\'ve got to play our way across the room.\" Behind the white pieces they could see another door. \"How?\" said Hermione nervously. \"I think,\" said Ron, \"we\\'re going to have to be chessmen.\" He walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knight\\'s horse. At once, the stone sprang to life. The horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron. \"Do we - er - have to join you to get across?\" The black knight nodded. Ron turned to the other two. \"This needs thinking about–\" he said. \"I suppose we\\'ve got to take the place of three of the black pieces–\" Harry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think. Finally he said, \"Now, don\\'t be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at chess - \" \"We\\'re not offended,\" said Harry quickly. \"Just tell us what to do.\" \"Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, you go there instead of that castle.\" \"What about you?\" \"I\\'m going to be a knight,\" said Ron. The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron, and Hermione took. \"White always plays first in chess,\" said Ron, peering across the board. \"Yes– look–\" A white pawn had moved forward two squares. Ron started to direct the black pieces. They moved silently wherever he sent them. Harry\\'s knees were trembling. What if they lost? \"Harry - move diagonally four squares to the right.\" Their first real shock came when their other knight was taken. The white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board, where he lay quite still, facedown. \"Had to let that happen,\" said Ron, looking shaken. \"Leaves you free to take that bishop, Hermione, go on.\" Every time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed no mercy. Soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall. Twice, Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in danger. He himself darted around the board, taking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black ones. \"We\\'re nearly there,\" he muttered suddenly. \"Let me think - let me think–\" The white queen turned her blank face toward him. \"Yes–\" said Ron softly, \"It\\'s the only way– I\\'ve got to be taken.\" \"NO!\" Harry and Hermione shouted. \"That\\'s chess!\" snapped Ron. \"You\\'ve got to make some sacrifices! I make my move and she\\'ll take me - that leaves you free to checkmate the king, Harry!\" \"But - \" \"Do you want to stop Snape or not?\" \"Ron - \" \"Look, if you don\\'t hurry up, he\\'ll already have the Stone!\" There was no alternative. \"Ready?\" Ron called, his face pale but determined. \"Here I go - now, don\\'t hang around once you\\'ve won.\" He stepped forward, and the white queen pounced. She struck Ron hard across the head with her stone arm, and he crashed to the floor - Hermione screamed but stayed on her square - the white queen dragged Ron to one side. He looked as if he\\'d been knocked out. Shaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left. The white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry\\'s feet. They had won. The chessmen parted and bowed, leaving the door ahead clear. With one last desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione charged through the door and up the next passageway. \"What if he\\'s - ?\" \"He\\'ll be all right,\" said Harry, trying to convince himself. \"What do you reckon\\'s next?\" \"We\\'ve had Sprout\\'s, that was the Devil\\'s Snare; Flitwick must\\'ve put charms on the keys; McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive; that leaves Quirrell\\'s spell, and Snape\\'s.\" They had reached another door. \"All right?\" Harry whispered. \"Go on.\" Harry pushed it open. A disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of them pull their robes up over their noses. Eyes watering, they saw, flat on the floor in front of them, a troll even larger than the one they had tackled, out cold with a bloody lump on its head. \"I\\'m glad we didn\\'t have to fight that one,\" Harry whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its massive legs. \"Come on, I can\\'t breathe.\" He pulled open the next door, both of them hardly daring to look at what came next - but there was nothing very frightening in here, just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line. \"Snape\\'s,\" said Harry. \"What do we have to do?\" They stepped over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway. It wasn\\'t ordinary fire either; it was purple. At the same instant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward. They were trapped. \"Look!\" Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles. Harry looked over her shoulder to read it: Danger lies before you, while safety lies behind, Two of us will help you, which ever you would find, One among us seven will let you move ahead, Another will transport the drinker back instead, Two among our number hold only nettle wine, Three of us are killers, waiting bidden in line. Choose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore, To help you in your choice, we give you these clues four: First, however slyly the poison tries to hide You will always find some on nettle wine\\'s left side; Second, different are those who stand at either end, But if you would move onward, neither is your friend; Third, as you see clearly, all are different size, Neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides; Fourth, the second left and the second on the right Are twins once you taste them, though different at first sight. Hermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw that she was smiling, the very last thing he felt like doing. \"Brilliant,\" said Hermione. \"This isn\\'t magic - it\\'s logic - a puzzle. A lot of the greatest wizards haven\\'t got an ounce of logic, they\\'d be stuck in here forever.\" \"But so will we, won\\'t we?\" \"Of course not,\" said Hermione. \"Everything we need is here on this paper. Seven bottles: three are poison; two are wine; one will get us safely through the black fire, and one will get us back through the purple.\" \"But how do we know which to drink?\" \"Give me a minute.\" Hermione read the paper several times. Then she walked up and down the line of bottles, muttering to herself and pointing at them. At last, she clapped her hands. \"Got it,\" she said. \"The smallest bottle will get us through the black fire - toward the Stone.\" Harry looked at the tiny bottle. \"There\\'s only enough there for one of us,\" he said. \"That\\'s hardly one swallow.\" They looked at each other. \"Which one will get you back through the purple flames?\" Hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line. \"You drink that,\" said Harry. \"No, listen, get back and get Ron. Grab brooms from the flying-key room, they\\'ll get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy - go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, we need him. I might be able to hold Snape off for a while, but I\\'m no match for him, really.\" \"But Harry - what if You-Know-Who\\'s with him?\" \"Well - I was lucky once, wasn\\'t I?\" said Harry, pointing at his scar. \"I might get lucky again.\" Hermione\\'s lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at Harry and threw her arms around him. \"Hermione!\" \"Harry - you\\'re a great wizard, you know.\" \"I\\'m not as good as you,\" said Harry, very embarrassed, as she let go of him. \"Me!\" said Hermione. \"Books! And cleverness! There are more important things - friendship and bravery and - oh Harry - be careful! \" \"You drink first,\" said Harry. \"You are sure which is which, aren\\'t you?\" \"Positive,\" said Hermione. She took a long drink from the round bottle at the end, and shuddered. \"It\\'s not poison?\" said Harry anxiously. \"No - but it\\'s like ice.\" \"Quick, go, before it wears off.\" \"Good luck - take care.\" \"GO!\" Hermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire. Harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle. He turned to face the black flames. \"Here I come,\" he said, and he drained the little bottle in one gulp. It was indeed as though ice was flooding his body. He put the bottle down and walked forward; he braced himself, saw the black flames licking his body, but couldn\\'t feel them - for a moment he could see nothing but dark fire - then he was on the other side, in the last chamber. There was already someone there - but it wasn\\'t Snape. It wasn\\'t even Voldemort. CHAPTER SEVENTEEN The Man With Two Faces It was Quirrell. \"You!\" gasped Harry. Quirrell smiled. His face wasn\\'t twitching at all. \"Me,\" he said calmly. \"I wondered whether I\\'d be meeting you here, Potter.\" \"But I thought - Snape - \" \"Severus?\" Quirrell laughed, and it wasn\\'t his usual quivering treble, either, but cold and sharp. \"Yes, Severus does seem the type, doesn\\'t he? So useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat. Next to him, who would suspect p-p-poor, st-stuttering P-Professor Quirrell?\" Harry couldn\\'t take it in. This couldn\\'t be true, it couldn\\'t. \"But Snape tried to kill me!\" \"No, no, no. I tried to kill you. Your friend Miss Granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to Snape at that Quidditch match. She broke my eye contact with you. Another few seconds and I\\'d have got you off that broom. I\\'d have managed it before then if Snape hadn\\'t been muttering a countercurse, trying to save you.\" \"Snape was trying to save me?\" \"Of course,\" said Quirrell coolly. \"Why do you think he wanted to referee your next match? He was trying to make sure I didn\\'t do it again. Funny, really– he needn\\'t have bothered. I couldn\\'t do anything with Dumbledore watching. All the other teachers thought Snape was trying to stop Gryffindor from winning, he did make himself unpopular– and what a waste of time, when after all that, I\\'m going to kill you tonight.\" Quirrell snapped his fingers. Ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped themselves tightly around Harry. \"You\\'re too nosy to live, Potter. Scurrying around the school on Halloween like that, for all I knew you\\'d seen me coming to look at what was guarding the Stone.\" \"You let the troll in?\" \"Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls - you must have seen what I did to the one in the chamber back there? Unfortunately, while everyone else was running around looking for it, Snape, who already suspected me, went straight to the third floor to head me off - and not only did my troll fail to beat you to death, that three-headed dog didn\\'t even manage to bite Snape\\'s leg off properly. \"Now, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this interesting mirror.\" It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell. It was the Mirror of Erised. \"This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,\" Quirrell murmured, tapping his way around the frame. \"Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like this– but he\\'s in London– I\\'ll be far away by the time he gets back–\" All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him from concentrating on the mirror. \"I saw you and Snape in the forest - \" he blurted out. \"Yes,\" said Quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to look at the back. \"He was on to me by that time, trying to find out how far I\\'d got. He suspected me all along. Tried to frighten me - as though he could, when I had Lord Voldemort on my side–\" Quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into it. \"I see the Stone– I\\'m presenting it to my master– but where is it?\" Harry struggled against the ropes binding him, but they didn\\'t give. He had to keep Quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror. \"But Snape always seemed to hate me so much.\" \"Oh, he does,\" said Quirrell casually, \"heavens, yes. He was at Hogwarts with your father, didn\\'t you know? They loathed each other. But he never wanted you dead.\" \"But I heard you a few days ago, sobbing - I thought Snape was threatening you–\" For the first time, a spasm of fear flitted across Quirrell\\'s face. \"Sometimes,\" he said, \"I find it hard to follow my master\\'s instructions - he is a great wizard and I am weak - \" \"You mean he was there in the classroom with you?\" Harry gasped. \"He is with me wherever I go,\" said Quirrell quietly. \"I met him when I traveled around the world. A foolish young man I was then, full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil. Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong I was. There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it– Since then, I have served him faithfully, although I have let him down many times. He has had to be very hard on me.\" Quirrell shivered suddenly. \"He does not forgive mistakes easily. When I failed to steal the stone from Gringotts, he was most displeased. He punished me– decided he would have to keep a closer watch on me–\" Quirrell\\'s voice trailed away. Harry was remembering his trip to Diagon Alley - how could he have been so stupid? He\\'d seen Quirrell there that very day, shaken hands with him in the Leaky Cauldron. Quirrell cursed under his breath. \"I don\\'t understand– is the Stone inside the mirror? Should I break it?\" Harry\\'s mind was racing. What I want more than anything else in the world at the moment, he thought, is to find the Stone before Quirrell does. So if I look in the mirror, I should see myself finding it - which means I\\'ll see where it\\'s hidden! But how can I look without Quirrell realizing what I\\'m up to? He tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass without Quirrell noticing, but the ropes around his ankles were too tight: he tripped and fell over. Quirrell ignored him. He was still talking to himself. \"What does this mirror do? How does it work? Help me, Master!\" And to Harry\\'s horror, a voice answered, and the voice seemed to come from Quirrell himself. \"Use the boy– Use the boy–\" Quirrell rounded on Harry. \"Yes - Potter - come here.\" He clapped his hands once, and the ropes binding Harry fell off. Harry got slowly to his feet. \"Come here,\" Quirrell repeated. \"Look in the mirror and tell me what you see.\" Harry walked toward him. I must lie, he thought desperately. I must look and lie about what I see, that\\'s all. Quirrell moved close behind him. Harry breathed in the funny smell that seemed to come from Quirrell\\'s turban. He closed his eyes, stepped in front of the mirror, and opened them again. He saw his reflection, pale and scared-looking at first. But a moment later, the reflection smiled at him. It put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a blood-red stone. It winked and put the Stone back in its pocket - and as it did so, Harry felt something heavy drop into his real pocket. Somehow - incredibly - he\\'d gotten the Stone. \"Well?\" said Quirrell impatiently. \"What do you see?\" Harry screwed up his courage. \"I see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore,\" he invented. \"I - I\\'ve won the house cup for Gryffindor.\" Quirrell cursed again. \"Get out of the way,\" he said. As Harry moved aside, he felt the Sorcerer\\'s Stone against his leg. Dare he make a break for it? But he hadn\\'t walked five paces before a high voice spoke, though Quirrell wasn\\'t moving his lips. \"He lies– He lies–\" \"Potter, come back here!\" Quirrell shouted. \"Tell me the truth! What did you just see?\" The high voice spoke again. \"Let me speak to him– face-to-face–\" \"Master, you are not strong enough!\" \"I have strength enough– for this–\" Harry felt as if Devil\\'s Snare was rooting him to the spot. He couldn\\'t move a muscle. Petrified, he watched as Quirrell reached up and began to unwrap his turban. What was going on? The turban fell away. Quirrell\\'s head looked strangely small without it. Then he turned slowly on the spot. Harry would have screamed, but he couldn\\'t make a sound. Where there should have been a back to Quirrell\\'s head, there was a face, the most terrible face Harry had ever seen. It was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake. \"Harry Potter–\" it whispered. Harry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldn\\'t move. \"See what I have become?\" the face said. \"Mere shadow and vapor– I have form only when I can share another\\'s body– but there have always been those willing to let me into their hearts and minds– Unicorn blood has strengthened me, these past weeks– you saw faithful Quirrell drinking it for me in the forest– and once I have the Elixir of Life, I will be able to create a body of my own– Now– why don\\'t you give me that Stone in your pocket?\" So he knew. The feeling suddenly surged back into Harry\\'s legs. He stumbled backward. \"Don\\'t be a fool,\" snarled the face. \"Better save your own life and join me– or you\\'ll meet the same end as your parents– They died begging me for mercy–\" \"LIAR!\" Harry shouted suddenly. Quirrell was walking backward at him, so that Voldemort could still see him. The evil face was now smiling. \"How touching–\" it hissed. \"I always value bravery– Yes, boy, your parents were brave– I killed your father first; and he put up a courageous fight– but your mother needn\\'t have died– she was trying to protect you– Now give me the Stone, unless you want her to have died in vain.\" \"NEVER!\" Harry sprang toward the flame door, but Voldemort screamed \"SEIZE HIM!\" and the next second, Harry felt Quirrell\\'s hand close on his wrist. At once, a needle-sharp pain seared across Harry\\'s scar; his head felt as though it was about to split in two; he yelled, struggling with all his might, and to his surprise, Quirrell let go of him. The pain in his head lessened - he looked around wildly to see where Quirrell had gone, and saw him hunched in pain, looking at his fingers - they were blistering before his eyes. \"Seize him! SEIZE HIM!\" shrieked Voldemort again, and Quirrell lunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet landing on top of him, both hands around Harry\\'s neck - Harry\\'s scar was almost blinding him with pain, yet he could see Quirrell howling in agony. \"Master, I cannot hold him - my hands - my hands!\" And Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground with his knees, let go of his neck and stared, bewildered, at his own palms - Harry could see they looked burned, raw, red, and shiny. \"Then kill him, fool, and be done!\" screeched Voldemort. Quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, but Harry, by instinct, reached up and grabbed Quirrell\\'s face - \"AAAARGH!\" Quirrell rolled off him, his face blistering, too, and then Harry knew: Quirrell couldn\\'t touch his bare skin, not without suffering terrible pain - his only chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep him in enough pain to stop him from doing a curse. Harry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm, and hung on as tight as he could. Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry off - the pain in Harry\\'s head was building - he couldn\\'t see - he could only hear Quirrell\\'s terrible shrieks and Voldemort\\'s yells of, \"KILL HIM! KILL HIM!\" and other voices, maybe in Harry\\'s own head, crying, \"Harry! Harry!\" He felt Quirrell\\'s arm wrenched from his grasp, knew all was lost, and fell into blackness, down– down– down– Something gold was glinting just above him. The Snitch! He tried to catch it, but his arms were too heavy. He blinked. It wasn\\'t the Snitch at all. It was a pair of glasses. How strange. He blinked again. The smiling face of Albus Dumbledore swam into view above him. \"Good afternoon, Harry,\" said Dumbledore. Harry stared at him. Then he remembered: \"Sir! The Stone! It was Quirrell! He\\'s got the Stone! Sir, quick - \" \"Calm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the times,\" said Dumbledore. \"Quirrell does not have the Stone.\" \"Then who does? Sir, I - \" \"Harry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown out.\" Harry swallowed and looked around him. He realized he must be in the hospital wing. He was lying in a bed with white linen sheets, and next to him was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop. \"Tokens from your friends and admirers,\" said Dumbledore, beaming. \"What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. I believe your friends Misters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat. No doubt they thought it would amuse you. Madam Pomfrey, however, felt it might not be very hygienic, and confiscated it.\" \"How long have I been in here?\" \"Three days. Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger will be most relieved you have come round, they have been extremely worried.\" \"But sir, the Stone - \" \"I see you are not to be distracted. Very well, the Stone. Professor Quirrell did not manage to take it from you. I arrived in time to prevent that, although you were doing very well on your own, I must say.\" \"You got there? You got Hermione\\'s owl?\" \"We must have crossed in midair. No sooner had I reached London than it became clear to me that the place I should be was the one I had just left. I arrived just in time to pull Quirrell off you.\" \"It was you.\" \"I feared I might be too late.\" \"You nearly were, I couldn\\'t have kept him off the Stone much longer Œ\" \"Not the Stone, boy, you - the effort involved nearly killed you. For one terrible moment there, I was afraid it had. As for the Stone, it has been destroyed.\" \"Destroyed?\" said Harry blankly. \"But your friend - Nicolas Flamel - \" \"Oh, you know about Nicolas?\" said Dumbledore, sounding quite delighted. \"You did do the thing properly, didn\\'t you? Well, Nicolas and I have had a little chat, and agreed it\\'s all for the best.\" \"But that means he and his wife will die, won\\'t they?\" \"They have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then, yes, they will die.\" Dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry\\'s face. \"To one as young as you, I\\'m sure it seems incredible, but to Nicolas and Perenelle, it really is like going to bed after a very, very long day. After all, to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure. You know, the Stone was really not such a wonderful thing. As much money and life as you could want! The two things most human beings would choose above all - the trouble is, humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them.\" Harry lay there, lost for words. Dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the ceiling. \"Sir?\" said Harry. \"I\\'ve been thinking– sir - even if the Stone\\'s gone, Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who - \" \"Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things. Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself.\" \"Yes, sir. Well, Voldemort\\'s going to try other ways of coming back, isn\\'t he? I mean, he hasn\\'t gone, has he?\" \"No, Harry, he has not. He is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking for another body to share– not being truly alive, he cannot be killed. He left Quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies. Nevertheless, Harry, while you may only have delayed his return to power, it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time - and if he is delayed again, and again, why, he may never return to power.\" Harry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made his head hurt. Then he said, \"Sir, there are some other things I\\'d like to know, if you can tell me– things I want to know the truth about–\" \"The truth.\" Dumbledore sighed. \"It is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution. However, I shall answer your questions unless I have a very good reason not to, in which case I beg you\\'ll forgive me. I shall not, of course, lie.\" \"Well– Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried to stop him from killing me. But why would he want to kill me in the first place?\" Dumbledore sighed very deeply this time. \"Alas, the first thing you ask me, I cannot tell you. Not today. Not now. You will know, one day– put it from your mind for now, Harry. When you are older– I know you hate to hear this– when you are ready, you will know.\" And Harry knew it would be no good to argue. \"But why couldn\\'t Quirrell touch me?\" \"Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand, it is love. He didn\\'t realize that love as powerful as your mother\\'s for you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign– to have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever. It is in your very skin. Quirrell, full of hatred, greed, and ambition, sharing his soul with Voldemort, could not touch you for this reason. It was agony to touch a person marked by something so good.\" Dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill, which gave Harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet. When he had found his voice again, Harry said, \"And the invisibility cloak - do you know who sent it to me?\" \"Ah - your father happened to leave it in my possession, and I thought you might like it.\" Dumbledore\\'s eyes twinkled. \"Useful things– your father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when he was here.\" \"And there\\'s something else–\" \"Fire away.\" \"Quirrell said Snape - \" \"Professor Snape, Harry.\" \"Yes, him - Quirrell said he hates me because he hated my father. Is that true?\" \"Well, they did rather detest each other. Not unlike yourself and Mr. Malfoy. And then, your father did something Snape could never forgive.\" \"What?\" \"He saved his life.\" \"What?\" \"Yes–\" said Dumbledore dreamily. \"Funny, the way people\\'s minds work, isn\\'t it? Professor Snape couldn\\'t bear being in your father\\'s debt– I do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would make him and your father even. Then he could go back to hating your father\\'s memory in peace–\" Harry tried to understand this but it made his head pound, so he stopped. \"And sir, there\\'s one more thing–\" \"Just the one?\" \"How did I get the Stone out of the mirror?\" \"Ah, now, I\\'m glad you asked me that. It was one of my more brilliant ideas, and between you and me, that\\'s saying something. You see, only one who wanted to find the Stone - find it, but not use it - would be able to get it, otherwise they\\'d just see themselves making gold or drinking Elixir of Life. My brain surprises even me sometimes– Now, enough questions. I suggest you make a start on these sweets. Ah! Bettie Bott\\'s Every Flavor Beans! I was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomit flavored one, and since then I\\'m afraid I\\'ve rather lost my liking for them - but I think I\\'ll be safe with a nice toffee, don\\'t you?\" He smiled and popped the golden-brown bean into his mouth. Then he choked and said, \"Alas! Ear wax!\" Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, was a nice woman, but very strict. \"Just five minutes,\" Harry pleaded. \"Absolutely not.\" \"You let Professor Dumbledore in–\" \"Well, of course, that was the headmaster, quite different. You need rest.\" \"I am resting, look, lying down and everything. Oh, go on, Madam Pomfrey–\" \"Oh, very well,\" she said. \"But five minutes only.\" And she let Ron and Hermione in. \"Harry!\" Hermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again, but Harry was glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore. \"Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to - Dumbledore was so worried - \" \"The whole school\\'s talking about it,\" said Ron. \"What really happened?\" It was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more strange and exciting than the wild rumors. Harry told them everything: Quirrell; the mirror; the Stone; and Voldemort. Ron and Hermione were a very good audience; they gasped in all the right places, and when Harry told them what was under Quirrell\\'s turban, Hermione screamed out loud. \"So the Stone\\'s gone?\" said Ron finally. \"Flamel\\'s just going to die?\" \"That\\'s what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that - what was it? - ‚to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.\\'\" \"I always said he was off his rocker,\" said Ron, looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was. \"So what happened to you two?\" said Harry. \"Well, I got back all right,\" said Hermione. \"I brought Ron round - that took a while - and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact Dumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall - he already knew - he just said, ‚Harry\\'s gone after him, hasn\\'t he?\\' and hurtled off to the third floor.\" \"D\\'you think he meant you to do it?\" said Ron. \"Sending you your father\\'s cloak and everything?\" \"Well, \" Hermione exploded, \"if he did - I mean to say that\\'s terrible - you could have been killed.\" \"No, it isn\\'t,\" said Harry thoughtfully. \"He\\'s a funny man, Dumbledore. I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance. I think he knows more or less everything that goes on here, you know. I reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try, and instead of stopping us, he just taught us enough to help. I don\\'t think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked. It\\'s almost like he thought I had the right to face Voldemort if I could–\" \"Yeah, Dumbledore\\'s off his rocker, all right,\" said Ron proudly. \"Listen, you\\'ve got to be up for the end-of-year feast tomorrow. The points are all in and Slytherin won, of course - you missed the last Quidditch match, we were steamrollered by Ravenclaw without you - but the food\\'ll be good.\" At that moment, Madam Pomfrey bustled over. \"You\\'ve had nearly fifteen minutes, now OUT\" she said firmly. After a good night\\'s sleep, Harry felt nearly back to normal. \"I want to go to the feast,\" he told Madam Pomfrey as she straightened his many candy boxes. \"I can, can\\'t I?\" \"Professor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go,\" she said stiffly, as though in her opinion Professor Dumbledore didn\\'t realize how risky feasts could be. \"And you have another visitor.\" \"Oh, good,\" said Harry. \"Who is it?\" Hagrid sidled through the door as he spoke. As usual when he was indoors, Hagrid looked too big to be allowed. He sat down next to Harry, took one look at him, and burst into tears. \"It\\'s - all - my - ruddy - fault!\" he sobbed, his face in his hands. \"I told the evil git how ter get past Fluffy! I told him! It was the only thing he didn\\'t know, an\\' I told him! Yeh could\\'ve died! All fer a dragon egg! I\\'ll never drink again! I should be chucked out an\\' made ter live as a Muggle!\" \"Hagrid!\" said Harry, shocked to see Hagrid shaking with grief and remorse, great tears leaking down into his beard. \"Hagrid, he\\'d have found out somehow, this is Voldemort we\\'re talking about, he\\'d have found out even if you hadn\\'t told him.\" \"Yeh could\\'ve died!\" sobbed Hagrid. \"An\\' don\\' say the name!\" \"VOLDEMORT!\" Harry bellowed, and Hagrid was so shocked, he stopped crying. \"I\\'ve met him and I\\'m calling him by his name. Please cheer up, Hagrid, we saved the Stone, it\\'s gone, he can\\'t use it. Have a Chocolate Frog, I\\'ve got loads–\" Hagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said, \"That reminds me. I\\'ve got yeh a present.\" \"It\\'s not a stoat sandwich, is it?\" said Harry anxiously, and at last Hagrid gave a weak chuckle. \"Nah. Dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it. ‚course, he shoulda sacked me instead - anyway, got yeh this–\" It seemed to be a handsome, leather-covered book. Harry opened it curiously. It was full of wizard photographs. Smiling and waving at him from every page were his mother and father. \"Sent owls off ter all yer parents\\' old school friends, askin\\' fer photos– knew yeh didn\\' have any– d\\'yeh like it?\" Harry couldn\\'t speak, but Hagrid understood. Harry made his way down to the end-of-year feast alone that night. He had been held up by Madam Pomfrey\\'s fussing about, insisting on giving him one last checkup, so the Great Hall was already full. It was decked out in the Slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate Slytherin\\'s winning the house cup for the seventh year in a row. A huge banner showing the Slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the High Table. When Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and then everybody started talking loudly at once. He slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione at the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up to look at him. Fortunately, Dumbledore arrived moments later. The babble died away. \"Another year gone!\" Dumbledore said cheerfully. \"And I must trouble you with an old man\\'s wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast. What a year it has been! Hopefully your heads are all a little fuller than they were– you have the whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty before next year starts– \"Now, as I understand it, the house cup here needs awarding, and the points stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor, with three hundred and twelve points; in third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty-two; Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty-six and Slytherin, four hundred and seventy-two.\" A storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin table. Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging his goblet on the table. It was a sickening sight. \"Yes, Yes, well done, Slytherin,\" said Dumbledore. \"However, recent events must be taken into account.\" The room went very still. The Slytherins\\' smiles faded a little. \"Ahem,\" said Dumbledore. \"I have a few last-minute points to dish out. Let me see. Yes– \"First - to Mr. Ronald Weasley–\" Ron went purple in the face; he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn. \"– for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.\" Gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars overhead seemed to quiver. Percy could be heard telling the other prefects, \"My brother, you know! My youngest brother! Got past McGonagall\\'s giant chess set!\" At last there was silence again. \"Second - to Miss Hermione Granger– for the use of cool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.\" Hermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected she had burst into tears. Gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves - they were a hundred points up. \"Third - to Mr. Harry Potter–\" said Dumbledore. The room went deadly quiet. \"– for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house sixty points.\" The din was deafening. Those who could add up while yelling themselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy-two points - exactly the same as Slytherin. They had tied for the house cup - if only Dumbledore had given Harry just one more point. Dumbledore raised his hand. The room gradually fell silent. \"There are all kinds of courage,\" said Dumbledore, smiling. \"It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends. I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville Longbottom.\" Someone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the noise that erupted from the Gryffindor table. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people hugging him. He had never won so much as a point for Gryffindor before. Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn\\'t have looked more stunned and horrified if he\\'d just had the Body-Bind Curse put on him. \"Which means,\" Dumbledore called over the storm of applause, for even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of Slytherin, \"we need a little change of decoration.\" He clapped his hands. In an instant, the green hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold; the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a towering Gryffindor lion took its place. Snape was shaking Professor McGonagall\\'s hand, with a horrible, forced smile. He caught Harry\\'s eye and Harry knew at once that Snape\\'s feelings toward him hadn\\'t changed one jot. This didn\\'t worry Harry. It seemed as though life would be back to normal next year, or as normal as it ever was at Hogwarts. It was the best evening of Harry\\'s life, better than winning at Quidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out mountain trolls– he would never, ever forget tonight. Harry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come, but come they did. To their great surprise, both he and Ron passed with good marks; Hermione, of course, had the best grades of the first years. Even Neville scraped through, his good Herbology mark making up for his abysmal Potions one. They had hoped that Goyle, who was almost as stupid as he was mean, might be thrown out, but he had passed, too. It was a shame, but as Ron said, you couldn\\'t have everything in life. And suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed, Neville\\'s toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out to all students, warning them not to use magic over the holidays (\"I always hope they\\'ll forget to give us these,\" said Fred Weasley sadly); Hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake; they were boarding the Hogwarts Express; talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier; eating Bettie Bott\\'s Every Flavor Beans as they sped past Muggle towns; pulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; pulling into platform nine and three-quarters at King\\'s Cross Station. It took quite a while for them all to get off the platform. A wizened old guard was up by the ticket barrier, letting them go through the gate in twos and threes so they didn\\'t attract attention by all bursting out of a solid wall at once and alarming the Muggles. \"You must come and stay this summer,\" said Ron, \"both of you - I\\'ll send you an owl.\" \"Thanks,\" said Harry, \"I\\'ll need something to look forward to.\" People jostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway back to the Muggle world. Some of them called: \"Bye, Harry!\" \"See you, Potter!\" \"Still famous,\" said Ron, grinning at him. \"Not where I\\'m going, I promise you,\" said Harry. He, Ron, and Hermione passed through the gateway together. \"There he is, Mom, there he is, look!\" It was Ginny Weasley, Ron\\'s younger sister, but she wasn\\'t pointing at Ron. \"Harry Potter!\" she squealed. \"Look, Mom! I can see - \" \"Be quiet, Ginny, and it\\'s rude to point.\" Mrs. Weasley smiled down at them. \"Busy year?\" she said. \"Very,\" said Harry. \"Thanks for the fudge and the sweater, Mrs. Weasley.\" \"Oh, it was nothing, dear.\" \"Ready, are you?\" It was Uncle Vernon, still purple-faced, still mustached, still looking furious at the nerve of Harry, carrying an owl in a cage in a station full of ordinary people. Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and Dudley, looking terrified at the very sight of Harry. \"You must be Harry\\'s family!\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"In a manner of speaking,\" said Uncle Vernon. \"Hurry up, boy, we haven\\'t got all day.\" He walked away. Harry hung back for a last word with Ron and Hermione. \"See you over the summer, then.\" \"Hope you have - er - a good holiday,\" said Hermione, looking uncertainly after Uncle Vernon, shocked that anyone could be so unpleasant. \"Oh, I will,\" said Harry, and they were surprised at the grin that was spreading over his face. \"They don\\'t know we\\'re not allowed to use magic at home. I\\'m going to have a lot of fun with Dudley this summer–\" ']\n"

Rowling \\n     CHAPTER ONE \\n  \\nThe Worst Birthday  Not for the first time, an argument had broken out\\n over breakfast at number four, Privet Drive. \\nMr. Vernon Dursley had been woken in the early hours of the morning by a loud, hooting noise from his nephew Harry™s room. \\n \\n      ﬁThird time this week!ﬂ he roared across th\\ne table. ﬁIf you can™t control that owl, it™ll have to go!ﬂ  \\n      Harry tried, yet again, to explain. \\n \\n      ﬁShe™s bored\\n,ﬂ he said. ﬁShe™s used to flying around outside. If I could just let her out at night -ﬂ  \\n      ﬁDo I look stupid?ﬂ snarled Uncle Vernon, a bit of fried egg dangling from his bushy mustache. \\nﬁI know what™ll happen if that owl™s let out.ﬂ \\n \\n      He exchanged dark looks with his wife, Petunia.        Harry tried to argue back but his words were drowned by a long, loud belch from the Dursleys™ \\nson, Dudley.  \\n      ﬁI want more bacon.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁThere™s more in the frying pan, sweetum\\ns,ﬂ said Aunt Petunia, turning misty eyes on her \\nmassive son. ﬁWe must build you up while we™ve got the chance– I don™t \\nlike the sound of that school food–ﬂ  \\n      ﬁNonsense, Petunia, I never went hungry when I was at Smeltings,ﬂ said Uncle Vernon heartily. \\nﬁDudley gets enough, don™t you, son?ﬂ \\n \\n      Dudley, who was so large his bottom drooped \\nover either side of the kitchen chair, grinned and turned to Harry.  \\n      ﬁPass the frying pan.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁYou™ve forgotten the magic word,ﬂ said Harry irritably. \\n\\n       The effect of this simple sentence on the re\\nst of the family was incredible: Dudley gasped and \\nfell off his chair with a crash that shook the whole kitchen; Mrs. Dursley gave a small scream \\nand clapped her hands to her mouth; Mr. Dursle\\ny jumped to his feet, veins throbbing in his \\ntemples. \\n \\n      ﬁI meant ‚please™!ﬂ said Harry quickly. ﬁI didn™t mean Šﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁWHAT HAVE I TOLD YOU,ﬂ thundered hi\\ns uncle, spraying spit over the table, ﬁABOUT SAYING THE ‚M™ WORD IN OUR HOUSE?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁBut I Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁHOW DARE YOU THRE\\nATEN DUDLEY!ﬂ roared Uncle Vernon, pounding the table with his fist. \\n \\n      ﬁI just Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁI WARNED YOU! I WILL NOT \\nTOLERATE MENTION OF YOUR ABNORMALITY \\nUNDER THIS ROOF!ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry stared from his pur\\nple-faced uncle to his pale aunt, who was trying to heave Dudley to his feet.  \\n      ﬁAll right,ﬂ said Harry, ﬁall right–ﬂ  \\n      Uncle Vernon sat back down, breathing like a winded rhinoceros and watching Harry closely out of the corners of his small, sharp eyes. \\n \\n      Ever since Harry had come home for th\\ne summer holidays, Uncle Vernon had been treating him \\nlike a bomb that might go off at any moment, because Harry Potter \\nwasn™t a normal boy. As a \\nmatter of fact, he was as not normal as it is possible to be. \\n \\n      Harry Potter was a wizard Š a wizard fresh from his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft \\nand Wizardry. And if the Dursleys were unhappy \\nto have him back for the holidays, it was \\nnothing to how Harry felt.  \\n      He missed Hogwarts so much it was like ha\\nving a constant stomachache. He missed the castle, \\nwith its secret passageways and ghosts, his classes (though perhaps not Snape, the Potions \\n\\nmaster), the mail arriving by owl, eating banquets \\nin the Great Hall, sleeping in his four-poster bed in the tower dormitory, visiting the gamekeeper\\n, Hagrid, in his cabin next to the Forbidden \\nForest in the grounds, and, especially, Quidditch, the most popular sport in the wizarding world \\n(six tall goal posts, four flying balls, and fourteen players on broomsticks). \\n \\n      All Harry™s spellbooks, his wand, robes, cauldron, and top-of-the-line Nimbus Two Thousand \\nbroomstick had been locked in a cupboard unde\\nr the stairs by Uncle Vernon the instant Harry had come home. What did the Dursleys care if \\nHarry lost his place on the House Quidditch team \\nbecause he hadn™t practiced all \\nsummer? What was it to the Durs\\nleys if Harry went back to school without any of his homewor\\nk done? The Dursleys were what \\nwizards called Muggles (not a drop of magical blood in their veins), and as far \\nas they were concerned, having a wizard in the family was a matter of deepest shame. Uncle Ve\\nrnon had even padlocked Harry™s owl, Hedwig, \\ninside her cage, to stop her from carrying messages to anyone in the wizarding world. \\n       Harry looked nothing like the rest of the family. Uncle Vernon was larg\\ne and neckless, with an enormous black mustache; Aunt Petunia was \\nhorse-faced and bony; Dudley was blond, pink, and porky. Harry, on the other hand, was small and ski\\nnny, with brilliant green eyes and jet-black hair that was always untidy. He wore round glasses, and on his forehead was a thin, lightning-shaped scar. \\n \\n      It was this scar that made Harry so partic\\nularly unusual, even for a wizard. This scar was the only hint of Harry™s very mysterious past, of the reason he had been left \\non the Dursleys™ doorstep eleven years before. \\n \\n      At the age of one year old, Harry had somehow survived a curse from the greatest Dark sorcerer \\nof all time, Lord Voldemort, whose name most w\\nitches and wizards still feared to speak. Harry™s parents had died in Voldemort™s attack, but \\nHarry had escaped with his lightning scar, and somehow Š nobody understood why ŠVoldemort™s pow\\ners had been destroyed the instant he had failed to kill Harry. \\n \\n      So Harry had been brought up by his dead mother™s sister and her husband. He had spent ten \\nyears with the Dursleys, never understanding why he kept making odd things happen without meaning to, believing the Dursleys™ st\\nory that he had got his scar in the car crash that had killed his parents.  \\n      And then, exactly a year ago, Hogwarts had \\nwritten to Harry, and the whole story had come out. \\nHarry had taken up his place at wizard school, wher\\ne he and his scar were famous– but now the \\nschool year was over, and he was back with the Dursleys for the summer, back to being treated \\nlike a dog that had rolled in something smelly. \\n \\n      The Dursleys hadn™t even remembered that\\n today happened to be Harry™s twelfth birthday. Of course, his hopes hadn™t been high; they™d never given him a real \\npresent, let alone a cake Š but to ignore it completely–  \\n \\n      At that moment, Uncle \\nVernon cleared his throat importantly\\n and said, ﬁNow, as we all know, today is a very important day.ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry looked up, hardly daring to believe it. \\n \\n      ﬁThis could well be the day I make th\\ne biggest deal of my career,ﬂ said Uncle Vernon.  \\n      Harry went back to his toast. Of course, he thought bitterly, Uncle Vernon was talking about the \\nstupid dinner party. He™d been talking of nothing else for two weeks. Some rich builder and his \\n\\nwife were coming to dinner and Uncle Vernon was hoping to get a huge order from him (Uncle \\nVernon™s company made drills). \\n       ﬁI think we should run through the schedule one more time,ﬂ said Uncle Vernon. ﬁWe should all \\nbe in position at eight o™clock. Petunia, you will be Š?ﬂ  \\n      ﬁIn the lounge,ﬂ said Aunt Petunia promptl\\ny, ﬁwaiting to welcome them graciously to our home.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁGood, good. And Dudley?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁI™ll be waiting to open the door.ﬂ Dudley put on a foul, simpering smile. ﬁMay I take your coats, \\nMr. and Mrs. Mason?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁThey™ll love him!ﬂ cried Aunt Petunia rapturously. \\n \\n      ﬁExcellent, Dudley,ﬂ said Uncle Vernon. Then he rounded on Harry. ﬁAnd you?ﬂ  \\n      ﬁI™ll be in my bedroom, making no noise a\\nnd pretending I™m not there,\\nﬂ said Harry tonelessly.  \\n      ﬁExactly,ﬂ said Uncle Vernon nastily. ﬁI \\nwill lead them into the l\\nounge, introduce you, Petunia, \\nand pour them drinks. At eight-fifteen Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁI™ll announce dinner,ﬂ said Aunt Petunia. \\n \\n      ﬁAnd, Dudley, you™ll say Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁMay I take you through to the dining room, \\nMrs. Mason?ﬂ said Dudley, offering his fat arm to \\nan invisible woman. \\n \\n      ﬁMy perfect little gentleman!ﬂ sniffed Aunt Petunia. \\n \\n      ﬁAnd you?ﬂ said Uncle Vernon \\nviciously to Harry.  \\n      ﬁI™ll be in my room, making no noise \\nand pretending I™m not there,ﬂ said Harry dully. \\n \\n      ﬁPrecisely. Now, we should aim to get in \\na few good compliments at dinne\\nr. Petunia, any ideas?ﬂ  \\n      ﬁVernon tells me you™re a \\nwonderful golfer, Mr. Mason– Do tell me where you bought your \\ndress, Mrs. Mason–ﬂ  \\n      ﬁPerfect– Dudley?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁHow about Š‚We had to write an essay \\nabout our hero at school, Mr. Mason, and I wrote about you.™ﬂ  \\n      This was too much for both Aunt Petuni\\na and Harry. Aunt Petunia burst into tears and hugged her son, while Harry ducked under the table so they wouldn™t see him laughing. \\n      ﬁAnd you, boy?ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry fought to keep his face straight as he emerged. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁI™ll be in my room, making no no\\nise and pretending I™m not there,ﬂ he said. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁToo right, you will.ﬂ said Uncle Vernon \\nforcefully. ﬁThe Masons don™t know anything about \\nyou and it™s going to stay that way. When dinner™s over, you take Mrs. Mason back to the lounge for coffee, Petunia, and I™ll bri\\nng the subject around to drills. With any luck, I™ll have the deal \\nsigned and sealed before the news at ten. Be shopping for a vacation home \\nin Majorca this time \\ntomorrow.ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry couldn™t feel too excited about this. He didn™t think the Dursleys\\n would like him any better \\nin Majorca than they did on Privet Drive. \\n \\n      ﬁRight Š I™m off into town to pi\\nck up the dinner jackets for Dudley and me. And \\nyou,ﬂ he snarled at Harry. ﬁYou stay out of yo\\nur aunt™s way while she™s cleaning.ﬂ  \\n      Harry left through the back door. It was a brilliant, sunny day. He crossed the lawn, slumped \\ndown on the garden bench, and sang under his breath:  \\n      ﬁHappy birthday to me– happy birthday to me–ﬂ \\n \\n      No cards, no presents, and he would be spending the evening pretending not to exist. He gazed \\nmiserably into the hedge. He had never felt so \\nlonely. More than anything else at Hogwarts, more even than playing Quidditch, Harry misse\\nd his best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione \\nGranger. They, however, didn™t seem to be missi\\nng him at all. Neither of them had written to \\nhim all summer, even though Ron had said he was going to ask Harry to come and stay. \\n \\n      Countless times, Harry had been on the point\\n of unlocking Hedwig™s cage by magic and sending \\nher to Ron and Hermione with a letter, but it wa\\nsn™t worth the risk. U\\nnderage wizards weren™t allowed to use magic outside of school. Harry ha\\ndn™t told the Dursleys this; he knew it was only their terror that he might turn\\n them all into dung beetles th\\nat stopped them from locking \\nhim in the cupboard under the stairs with his wand and broomstick. For the first couple of weeks back, \\nHarry had enjoyed muttering nonsense words under \\nhis breath and watching Dudley tearing out of the room as fast as his fat legs would carry him. But the long silence from Ron and Hermione \\n\\nhad made Harry feel so cut off from the magical\\n world that even taunting Dudley had lost its appeal Š and now Ron and Hermione had forgotten his birthday. \\n \\n      What wouldn™t he give now for a message\\n from Hogwarts? From any witch or wizard? He™d \\nalmost be glad of a sight of his archenemy, Draco\\n Malfoy, just to be sure it hadn™t all been a dream–  \\n \\n      Not that his whole year at Hogwarts had been fun. At the very end of last term, Harry had come \\nface-to-face with none other than Lord Voldemort \\nhimself. Voldemort might be a ruin of his \\nformer self, but he was still te\\nrrifying, still cunning, still determined to re\\ngain power. Harry had slipped through Voldemort™s clutches for a second time, but it had been a narrow escape, and \\neven now, weeks later, Harry kept waking in the \\nnight, drenched in cold sweat, wondering where Voldemort was now, remembering his livid face, his wide, mad eyes Š \\n       Harry suddenly sat bolt upright on the garden bench. He had been staring absent-mindedly into \\nthe hedge Š and the hedge was staring back. Two enormous green eyes had appeared among \\nthe leaves.  \\n      Harry jumped to his feet just as a jeering voice floated across the lawn.  \\n      ﬁI know what day it is,ﬂ sang Dudley, waddling toward him. \\n \\n      The huge eyes blinked and vanished. \\n \\n      ﬁWhat?ﬂ said Harry, not taking hi\\ns eyes off the spot where they had been. \\n \\n      ﬁI know what day it is,ﬂ Dudley repeated, coming right up to him. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁWell done,ﬂ said Harry. ﬁSo you™\\nve finally learned the days of the week.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁToday™s your birthday,ﬂ sneered Dudley. ﬁHow come you \\nhaven™t got any cards? Haven™t you \\neven got friends at that freak place?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁBetter not let your mum hear you talking about my \\nschool,ﬂ said Harry coolly.  \\n      Dudley hitched up his trousers, which were slipping down his fat bottom. \\n \\n      ﬁWhy™re you staring at th\\ne hedge?ﬂ he said suspiciously. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁI™m trying to decide what would be \\nthe best spell to set it on fire,ﬂ said Harry.  \\n      Dudley stumbled backward at once, a look of panic on his fat face. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁYou c-can™t Š Dad told you you™re not to do m-magic Š he said he™ll chuck you out of the \\nhouse Š and you haven™t got anywhere else to go Š you haven™t got any friends to take you Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁJiggery pokery!ﬂ said Harry in a fierce voice. ﬁ\\nHocus pocus Š squiggly wiggly Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁMUUUUUUM!ﬂ howled Dudley, tripping over his feet as he dashed back toward the house. ﬁMUUUUM! He™s doing you know what!ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry paid dearly for his moment of fun. \\nAs neither Dudley nor the hedge was in any way hurt, Aunt Petunia knew he hadn™t really done magic, \\nbut he still had to duck as she aimed a heavy \\nblow at his head with the soapy frying pan. Then she gave him work to do, with the promise he \\nwouldn™t eat again until he™d finished.        While Dudley lolled ar\\nound watching and eating ice cream, Harry cleaned the windows, washed the car, mowed the lawn, trimmed the flowerbeds\\n, pruned and watered the roses, and repainted the garden bench. The sun blazed overhead, burning the back of his neck. Harry knew he \\nshouldn™t have risen to Dudley™s bait, but Dudley had said the very thing Harry had been thinking himself– maybe he \\ndidn™t have any friends at Hogwarts–   \\n      Wish they could see famous Harry Potter now, he thought savagely as he spread manure on the \\nflower beds, his back aching, sweat running down his face.  \\n      It was half past seven in the evening when at last, exhausted, he heard Aunt Petunia calling him.  \\n      ﬁGet in here! And walk on the newspaper!ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry moved gladly into the shade of the gleaming kitchen. On\\n top of the fridge stood tonight™s pudding: a huge mound of whipped cream and sugared \\nviolets. A loin of roast pork was sizzling in the oven.  \\n      ﬁEat quickly! The Masons will be here soon\\n!ﬂ snapped Aunt Petunia, pointing to two slices of \\nbread and a lump of cheese on the kitchen table.\\n She was already wearing a salmon-pink cocktail \\ndress.  \\n      Harry washed his hands and bolted down his pitiful supper. The moment he had finished, Aunt \\nPetunia whisked away his plate. ﬁUpstairs! Hurry!ﬂ \\n \\n      As he passed the door to the living room, Harry \\ncaught a glimpse of Uncl\\ne Vernon and Dudley in bow ties and dinner jackets. He had only just reached the upstairs landing when the door bell rang and Uncle Vernon™s furious face appeared at the foot of the stairs. \\n \\n      ﬁRemember, boy Š one sound Šﬂ \\n\\n \\n      Harry crossed to his bedroom on tiptoe slipped inside, closed th\\ne door, and turned to collapse on his bed. The trouble was, there was already someone sitting on it. \\n \\n           \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  CHAPTER TWO \\n  Dobby™s Warning  \\n  Harry managed not to shout out, but it was a cl\\nose thing. The little creature on the bed had large, \\nbat-like ears and bulging green eyes the size of tennis balls. Harry knew instantly that this was what had been watching him out of the garden hedge that morning. \\n \\n      As they stared at each other, Harry heard Dudley™s voice from the hall. \\n \\n      ﬁMay I take your coats, Mr. and Mrs. Mason?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      The creature slipped off the bed and bowed so low that the end of its long, thin nose touched the carpet. Harry noticed that it was wearing what looked like an old pillowcase, with rips for arm- \\nand leg-holes.  \\n      ﬁEr Š hello,ﬂ said Harry nervously. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁHarry Potter!ﬂ said the creature in a \\nhigh-pitched voice Harry was sure would carry down the \\nstairs. ﬁSo long has Dobby wanted to meet you, sir– Such an honor it is–ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁTh-thank you,ﬂ said Harry, edging along the wall and sinking into his desk chair, next to Hedwig, who was asleep in her large cage. He wanted to ask, ﬁWhat ar\\ne you?ﬂ but thought it \\nwould sound too rude, so instead he said, ﬁWho are you?ﬂ \\n       ﬁDobby, sir. Just Dobby. Dobby the house-elf,ﬂ said the creature.  \\n      ﬁOh Š really?ﬂ said Harry. ﬁEr Š I don™t want to be rude or \\nanything, but Š this isn™t a great time for me to have a house-elf in my bedroom.ﬂ \\n \\n      Aunt Petunias high, false laugh sounde\\nd from the living room. The elf hung his head. \\n \\n      ﬁNot that I™m not pleased to meet you,ﬂ sa\\nid Harry quickly, ﬁbut, er, is there any particular reason you™re here?ﬂ  \\n      ﬁOh, yes, sir,ﬂ said Dobby earnestly. ﬁDobby has come to tell you, sir– it is difficult, sir– \\nDobby wonders where to begin–ﬂ  \\n      ﬁSit down,ﬂ said Harry politely, pointing at the bed.  \\n      To his horror, the elf burst into tears Š very noisy tears.  \\n      ﬁS-sit down!ﬂ he wailed. ﬁNever– never ever–ﬂ  \\n      Harry thought he heard the voices downstairs falter.       ﬁI™m sorry,ﬂ he whispered, ﬁI \\ndidn™t mean to offend you or anything Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁOffend Dobby!ﬂ choked the elf. ﬁDobby has never been asked to sit down by a wizard Š like an equal Šﬂ  \\n      Harry, trying to say ﬁShh!ﬂ and look comforting at the same time, ushered Dobby back onto the \\nbed where he sat hiccoughing, looking like a large and very ugly doll. At last he managed to \\n\\ncontrol himself, and sat with his great eyes fixe\\nd on Harry in an expression of watery adoration.  \\n      ﬁYou can™t have met many decent wi\\nzards,ﬂ said Harry, trying to cheer him up. \\n \\n      Dobby shook his head. Then, without warning, he leapt up and started banging his head furiously on the window, shouting, ﬁBad Dobby! Bad Dobby!ﬂ  \\n      ﬁDon™t Š what are you doing?ﬂ Harry hi\\nssed, springing up and pulling Dobby back onto the bed Š Hedwig had woken up with a particularly loud screech and was beating her wings wildly \\nagainst the bars of her cage.  \\n      ﬁDobby had to punish himself, sir,ﬂ said\\n the elf, who had gone slightly cross-eyed. ﬁDobby almost spoke ill of his family, sir–ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁYour family?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁThe wizard family Dobby serves, sir– \\nDobby is a house-elf Š bound to serve one house and one family forever–ﬂ \\n       ﬁDo they know you™re here?ﬂ asked Harry curiously. \\n \\n      Dobby shuddered. \\n \\n      ﬁOh, no, sir, no– Dobby will have to punish hi\\nmself most grievously for coming to see you, sir. \\nDobby will have to shut his ears in the oven \\ndoor for this. If they ever knew, sir Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁBut won™t they notice if you shut your ears in the oven door?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁDobby doubts it, sir. Dobby is always having to punish himself for something, sir. They lets \\nDobby get on with it, sir. Sometimes they\\n reminds me to do extra punishments–ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁBut why don™t you leave? Escape?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁA house-elf must be set free, sir. And \\nthe family will never set Dobby free– Dobby will serve \\nthe family until he dies, sir–ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry stared. \\n \\n      ﬁAnd I thought I had it bad staying here for another four weeks,ﬂ he said. ﬁThis makes the \\nDursleys sound almost human. Can™t anyone help you? Can™t I?ﬂ \\n       Almost at once, Harry wished he hadn™t \\nspoken. Dobby dissolved again into wails of gratitude. \\n \\n      ﬁPlease,ﬂ Harry whispered frantically, ﬁplease be quiet. If the Dursleys hear anything, if they know you™re here Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁHarry Potter asks if he can help D\\nobby– Dobby has heard of your greatness, sir, but of your goodness, Dobby never knew–ﬂ  \\n      Harry, who was feeling distinctly hot in\\n the face, said, ﬁWhateve\\nr you™ve heard about my \\ngreatness is a load of rubbish. I™m not even top of\\n my year at Hogwarts; that™s Hermione, she Šﬂ \\n \\n      But he stopped quickly, because thinking about Hermione was painful. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁHarry Potter is humble and modest,ﬂ said\\n Dobby reverently, his orb-like eyes aglow. ﬁHarry Potter speaks not of his triumph \\nover He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁVoldemort?ﬂ said Harry. \\n\\n \\n      Dobby clapped his hands over his bat ears and moaned, ﬁAh, speak not the name, sir! Speak not \\nthe name!ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁSorry,ﬂ said Harry quickly. ﬁI know lots of people don™t like it. My friend Ron Šﬂ  \\n      He stopped again. Thinking about Ron was painful, too.        Dobby leaned toward Harry, his eyes wide as headlights. \\n \\n      ﬁDobby heard tell,ﬂ he said hoarsely, ﬁthat Harry\\n Potter met the Dark Lord for a second time just \\nweeks ago– that Harry Potter escaped yet again.ﬂ  \\n      Harry nodded and Dobby™s eyes suddenly shone with tears. \\n \\n      ﬁAh, sir,ﬂ he gasped, dabbing his face with\\n a corner of the grubby pillowcase he was wearing. ﬁHarry Potter is valiant and bold! He has braved so many dangers already! But Dobby has come \\nto protect Harry Potter, to warn him, even if \\nhe does have to shut his ears in the oven door later– \\nHarry Potter must not go back to Hogwarts.ﬂ  \\n      There was a silence broken only by the chink of knives and forks from downstairs and the distant rumble of Uncle Vernon™s voice. \\n \\n      ﬁW-what?ﬂ Harry stammered. ﬁBut I™ve got to \\ngo back Š term starts on September first. It™s all \\nthat™s keeping me going. You don™t \\nknow what it™s like here. I don™t belong here. I belong in your world Š at Hogwarts.ﬂ        ﬁNo, no, no,ﬂ squeaked Dobby, shaking his head so hard his ears flapped. ﬁHarry Potter must \\nstay where he is safe. He is too great, too good, to lose. If Harry Potter goes back to Hogwarts, \\nhe will be in mortal danger.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWhy?ﬂ said Harry in surprise. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁThere is a plot, Harry Potter. A plot to ma\\nke most terrible things ha\\nppen at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year,ﬂ whispe\\nred Dobby, suddenly trembling all over. ﬁDobby has \\nknown it for months, sir. Harry Potter must not put \\nhimself in peril. He is too important, sir!ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWhat terrible things?ﬂ said\\n Harry at once. ﬁWho™s plotting them?ﬂ \\n \\n      Dobby made a funny choking noise and then\\n banged his head frantically against the wall.  \\n      ﬁAll right!ﬂ cried Harry, grabbing the elf™s arm to stop him. ﬁYou can™t tell me. I understand. But \\nwhy are you warning me?ﬂ A sudden, unpleasant thought struck \\nhim. ﬁHang on Š this hasn™t got \\nanything to do with Vol Š sorry Š with You-Know-Who, has it? You could just shake or nod,ﬂ \\nhe added hastily as Dobby™s head tilted worryingly close to the wall again. \\n \\n      Slowly, Dobby shook his head. \\n \\n      ﬁNot Š not He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named\\n, sir Šﬂ  \\n      But Dobby™s eyes were wide and he seemed\\n to be trying to give Harry a hint. Harry, however, was completely lost. \\n       ﬁHe hasn™t got a brother, has he?ﬂ  \\n      Dobby shook his head, his eyes wider than ever.  \\n      ﬁWell then, I can™t think who else would have a chance of\\n making horrible things happen at \\nHogwarts,ﬂ said Harry. ﬁI mean, there™s \\nDumbledore, for one thing Š you know who \\nDumbledore is, don™t you?ﬂ \\n \\n      Dobby bowed his head. \\n \\n      ﬁAlbus Dumbledore is the greatest head\\nmaster Hogwarts has ever\\n had. Dobby knows it, sir. Dobby has heard Dumbledore™s powers rival thos\\ne of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named at the \\nheight of his strength. But, sirﬂ Š Dobby™s voice dropped to an urgent whisper Š ﬁthere are \\npowers Dumbledore doesn™t– powers no decent wizard–ﬂ \\n \\n      And before Harry could stop him, Dobby bounded off the bed, seized Harry™s desk lamp, and \\nstarted beating himself around the \\nhead with earsplitting yelps.  \\n      A sudden silence fell downstairs. Two seconds later Harry, heart thudding madly, heard Uncle \\nVernon coming into the hall, calling, ﬁDudley must have left his television on again, the little tyke!ﬂ        ﬁQuick! In the closet!ﬂ hissed Harry, st\\nuffing Dobby in, shutting the door, and flinging himself \\nonto the bed just as the door handle turned.  \\n      ﬁWhat Š the Š\\ndevil Š are Š you Š doing?ﬂ said Uncle Ve\\nrnon through gritted teeth, his face horribly close to Harry™s. ﬁYou™ve just ruined the punch line of my Japanese golfer joke– One \\nmore sound and you™ll wish you™d never been born, boy!ﬂ  \\n      He stomped flat-footed from the room. \\n\\n \\n      Shaking, Harry let Dobby out of the closet. \\n \\n      ﬁSee what it™s like here?ﬂ he said. ﬁSee why \\nI™ve got to go back to Hogwarts? It™s the only place \\nI™ve got Š well, I think I™ve got friends.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁFriends who don™t even write to Harry Potter?ﬂ said Dobby slyly. \\n \\n      ﬁI expect they™ve just been Š wait a minute,ﬂ said Harry, frowning. ﬁHow do \\nyou know my \\nfriends haven™t been writing to me?ﬂ \\n \\n      Dobby shuffled his feet. \\n \\n      ﬁHarry Potter mustn™t be angr\\ny with Dobby. Dobby did it for the best Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁHave you been stopping my letters?ﬂ  \\n      ﬁDobby has them here, sir,ﬂ said the elf. St\\nepping nimbly out of Harry™s reach, he pulled a thick \\nwad of envelopes from the inside of the pi\\nllowcase he was wearing. Harry could make out \\nHermione™s neat writing, Ron™s untidy scrawl, an\\nd even a scribble that looked as though it was from the Hogwarts gamekeeper, Hagrid. \\n \\n      Dobby blinked anxiously up at Harry. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁHarry Potter mustn™t be angry– D\\nobby hoped– if Harry Potter thought his friends had forgotten him– Harry Potter might not want to go back to school, sir–ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry wasn™t listening. He made a grab\\n for the letters, but Dobby jumped out of reach. \\n \\n      ﬁHarry Potter will have them, sir, if he gi\\nves Dobby his word that he will not return to Hogwarts. \\nAh, sir, this is a danger you must \\nnot face! Say you won™t go back, sir!ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁNo,ﬂ said Harry angrily. ﬁGive me my friends™ letters!ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁThen Harry Potter leaves Dobby no choice,ﬂ said the elf sadly. \\n       Before Harry could move, Dobby had darted to the bedroom door, pu\\nlled it open, and sprinted down the stairs.        Mouth dry, stomach lurching, Harry sprang af\\nter him, trying not to make a sound. He jumped the \\nlast six steps, landing catlike on the hall carpet, looking around for Dobby. From the dining room \\nhe heard Uncle Vernon saying, ﬁ– tell Petunia that very funny story about those American plumbers, Mr. Mason. She™s been dying to hear–ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry ran up the hall into the kitchen and felt his stomach disappear. \\n \\n      Aunt Petunia™s masterpiece of a pudding, \\nthe mountain of cream and sugared violets, was \\nfloating up near the ceiling. On top of a cupboard in the corner crouched Dobby.  \\n      ﬁNo,ﬂ croaked Harry. ﬁPlease– they™ll kill me–ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁHarry Potter must say he™s not going back to school Šﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁDobby– please–ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁSay it, sir Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁI can™t Šﬂ \\n \\n      Dobby gave him a tragic look. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁThen Dobby must do it, sir, for Harry Potter™s own good.ﬂ \\n       The pudding fell to the floor with a heart-stopping crash. Cream \\nsplattered the windows and walls as the dish shattered. With \\na crack like a whip, Dobby vanished.  \\n      There were screams from the dining room \\nand Uncle Vernon burst into the kitchen to find Harry, rigid with shock, covered from head\\n to foot in Aunt Petunia™s pudding.  \\n      At first, it looked as though Uncle Vernon would manage to \\ngloss the whole thing over. (ﬁJust our nephew Švery disturbed Š meeting strangers upsets him, so we kept\\n him upstairs–ﬂ) He \\n\\nshooed the shocked Masons back into the dining room, promised Harry he would flay him to \\nwithin an inch of his life when the Masons had left, and handed him a mop. Aunt Petunia dug \\nsome ice cream out of the freezer and Harry, st\\nill shaking, started scrubbing the kitchen clean. \\n \\n      Uncle Vernon might still have been able to\\n make his deal Š if it hadn™t been for the owl.  \\n      Aunt Petunia was just passing around a box of after-dinner mints when\\n a huge barn owl swooped through the dining room window, dropped a lette\\nr on Mrs. Mason™s head, and swooped out again. Mrs. Mason screamed like a banshee and \\nran from the house shouting about lunatics. Mr. \\nMason stayed just long enough to tell the Dursleys that his wife was mortally afraid of birds of \\nall shapes and sizes, and to ask whether this was their idea of a joke. \\n      Harry stood in the kitchen, clutching the mop for support, as Uncle Vernon advanced on him, a \\ndemonic glint in his tiny eyes. \\n       ﬁRead it!ﬂ he hissed evilly, brandishing the letter the owl had deliv\\nered. ﬁGo on Š read it!ﬂ  \\n      Harry took it. It did not contain birthday greetings.        Dear Mr. Potter,  \\n      We have received intelligence that a Hover \\nCharm was used at your place of residence this \\nevening at twelve minutes past nine. \\n \\n      As you know, underage wizards are not permitted to perform spells outside school, and further spellwork on your part may lead to expulsion from said school. (Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery, 1875, Paragraph C). \\n \\n      We would also ask you to remember that any magical activity that risks notice by members of the non magical community (Muggles) is a serious of\\nfense under section 13 of the International Confederation of Warlocks™ Statute of Secrecy.  \\n      Enjoy your holidays! \\n \\n  Yours sincerely, \\n\\n \\n    Mafalda Hopkirk \\n\\n   IMPROPER USE OF MAGIC OFFICE \\n \\n  Ministry of Magic \\n       Harry looked up from the letter and gulped. \\n \\n      ﬁYou didn™t tell us you weren™t allowed to use magic outside school,\\nﬂ said Uncle Vernon, a mad gleam dancing in his eyes. ﬁForgot to me\\nntion it– Slipped your mind, I daresay–ﬂ \\n \\n      He was bearing down on Harry like a great \\nbulldog, all his teeth bared. ﬁWell, I™ve got news for \\nyou, boy– I™m locking you up– You™re never going back to that school– never– and if you \\n\\ntry and magic yourself out Š they™ll expel you!ﬂ \\n \\n      And laughing like a maniac, \\nhe dragged Harry back upstairs. \\n \\n      Uncle Vernon was as bad as his word. The following morning, he paid a man to fit bars on \\nHarry™s window. He himself fitted a cat-flap in \\nthe bedroom door, so that small amounts of food \\ncould be pushed inside three times a day. They \\nlet Harry out to use the bathroom morning and \\nevening. Otherwise, he was locked in his room around the clock. \\n     Three days later, the Du\\nrsleys were showing no sign of relenting, and Harry couldn™t see any way out of his situation. He lay on his bed watching the sun sinking behind the bars on the window and wondered miserably what\\n was going to happen to him. \\n       What was the good of magi\\ncking himself out of his room if \\nHogwarts would expel him for doing \\nit? Yet life at Privet Drive had reached an all-ti\\nme low. Now that the Dursleys knew they weren™t \\ngoing to wake up as fruit bats, he had lost his only weapon. Dobby might have saved Harry from \\nhorrible happenings at Hogwarts, but the way things were going, he™d probably starve to death anyway.  \\n      The cat-flap rattled and Aunt Petunias hand appeared, pushing a bowl of canned soup into the \\nroom. Harry, whose insides were \\naching with hunger, jumped off his bed and seized it. The soup \\nwas stone-cold, but he drank half of it in one gulp. Then he crossed the room to Hedwig™s cage \\nand tipped the soggy vegetables at the bottom of \\nthe bowl into her empty food tray. She ruffled \\nher feathers and gave him a look of deep disgust.  \\n      ﬁIt™s no good turning your beak up at it Š that™s all we™ve got,ﬂ said Harry grimly. \\n \\n      He put the empty bowl back on the floor \\nnext to the cat-flap and lay back down on the bed, somehow even hungrier than he had been before the soup. \\n \\n      Supposing he was still alive in another four \\nweeks, what would happen if he didn™t turn up at \\nHogwarts? Would someone be sent\\n to see why he hadn™t come b\\nack? Would they be able to \\nmake the Dursleys let him go? \\n \\n      The room was growing dark. Exhausted, stomach rumbling, mind spinning over the same \\nunanswerable questions, Harry fell into an uneasy sleep.  \\n      He dreamed that he was on show in a \\nzoo, with a card reading UNDERAGE WIZARD attached \\nto his cage. People goggled through the bars at him as he lay, starving and weak, on a bed of straw. He saw Dobby™s face in the crowd and shouted out, asking for help, but Dobby called, \\nﬁHarry Potter is safe there, sir!ﬂ and vanished. Then the Dursleys appeared and Dudley rattled \\n\\nthe bars of the cage, laughing at him.  \\n      ﬁStop it,ﬂ Harry muttered as the rattling \\npounded in his sore head. ﬁLeave me alone– cut it \\nout– I™m trying to sleep–ﬂ \\n \\n      He opened his eyes. Moonlight was shining through the bars on the window. And someone \\nwas goggling through the bars at him: a freck\\nle-faced, red-haired, long-nosed someone. \\n \\n      Ron Weasley was outside Harry™s window. \\n\\n \\n        CHAPTER THREE   The Burrow \\n \\n  ﬁRon.ﬂ breathed Harry, creeping to the window a\\nnd pushing it up so they could talk through the bars. ﬁRon, how did you Š? What the Š?ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry™s mouth fell open as the full impact of\\n what he was seeing hit him. Ron was leaning out of \\nthe back window of an old turquoise car, which was parked in midair. Grinning at Harry from \\nthe front seats were Fred and George, Ron™s elder twin brothers.  \\n      ﬁAll right, Harry?ﬂ asked George. \\n \\n      ﬁWhat™s been going on?ﬂ said Ron. ﬁWhy \\nhaven™t you been answering my letters? I™ve asked \\nyou to stay about twelve times, and then Dad came\\n home and said you™d got an official warning for using magic in front of Muggles Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁIt wasn™t me Š and how did he know?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁHe works for the Ministry,ﬂ said Ron. ﬁYou know we™re not supposed to do spells outside school Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁYou should talk,ﬂ said Harry, staring at the floating car. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁOh, this doesn™t count,ﬂ said Ron. ﬁWe™re only borrowing this. It™s Dad™s, \\nwe didn™t enchant it. But doing magic in front of those Muggles you live with Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁI told you, I didn™t Š but it™ll take too long to explain now Š look, can you tell them at \\nHogwarts that the Dursleys have locked me up and won™t let me come back, and obviously I \\ncan™t magic myself out, because the Ministry™ll \\nthink that™s the second spell I™ve done in three \\ndays, so Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁStop gibbering,ﬂ said Ron. ﬁWe™ve come to take you home with us.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁBut you can™t magic me out either Šﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁWe don™t need to,ﬂ said Ron, jerking his h\\nead toward the front seat and grinning. ﬁYou forget who I™ve got with me.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁTie that around the bars,ﬂ said Fred, throwing the end of a rope to Harry. \\n \\n      ﬁIf the Dursleys wake up, I™m dead,ﬂ said Ha\\nrry as he tied the rope tightly around a bar and Fred revved up the car.  \\n      ﬁDon™t worry,ﬂ said Fred, ﬁand stand back.ﬂ       Harry moved back into the shadows next to Hedwig, who seemed to ha\\nve realized how important \\nthis was and kept still and silent. The car revved louder and louder and suddenly, with a crunching noise, the bars were pulled clean out of the window as Fred drove straight up in the air. Harry ran back to the window to see the bars dangling a few feet above the ground. Panting, \\nRon hoisted them up into the car. Harry liste\\nned anxiously, but there was no sound from the Dursleys™ bedroom. \\n       When the bars were safely in the back se\\nat with Ron, Fred reversed as close as possible to Harry™s window.  \\n      ﬁGet in,ﬂ Ron said. \\n \\n      ﬁBut all my Hogwarts stuff Š my wand Š my broomstick Šﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁWhere is it?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁLocked in the cupboard under the stairs, and I can™t get out of this room Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁNo problem,ﬂ said George from th\\ne front passenger seat. ﬁOut of the way, Harry.ﬂ  \\n      Fred and George climbed catlike through the window into Harry™s room. You had to hand it to \\nthem, thought Harry, as George took\\n an ordinary hairpin from his pocket and started to pick the lock.  \\n      ﬁA lot of wizards think it™s a waste of time, knowing this sort \\nof Muggle trick,ﬂ said Fred, ﬁbut we feel they™re skills worth learning, even if they are a bit slow.ﬂ \\n \\n      There was a small click and the door swung open. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁSo Š we™ll get your trunk Š you grab anything you need from your room and hand it out to \\nRon,ﬂ whispered George.  \\n      ﬁWatch out for the bottom stair Š it creak\\ns,ﬂ Harry whispered back as the twins disappeared onto the dark landing.  \\n      Harry dashed around his room, collecting his \\nthings and passing them out of the window to Ron. \\nThen he went to help Fred and George heave his trunk up the stairs. Harry heard Uncle Vernon cough.  \\n      At last, panting, they reached the landi\\nng, then carried the trunk through Harry™s room to the \\nopen window. Fred climbed back into the car to\\n pull with Ron, and Harry and George pushed from the bedroom side. Inch by inch, the trunk slid through the window. \\n \\n      Uncle Vernon coughed again. \\n \\n      ﬁA bit more,ﬂ panted Fred, who was pulling from inside the car. ﬁOne good push Šﬂ \\n      Harry and George threw their shoulders against the trunk and it slid out of the window into the back seat of the car.        ﬁOkay, let™s go,ﬂ George whispered. \\n \\n      But as Harry climbed onto the windowsill there came a sudden loud screech from behind him, \\nfollowed immediately by the thunde\\nr of Uncle Vernon™s voice.  \\n      ﬁTHAT RUDDY OWL!ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁI™ve forgotten Hedwig!ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry tore back across the room as the \\nlanding light clicked on Š he snatched up Hedwig™s cage, dashed to the window, and passed it out to Ron. He was scrambling back onto the chest of \\ndrawers when Uncle Vernon hammered on the unlocked door Š and it crashed open.  \\n      For a split second, Uncle Vernon stood framed\\n in the doorway; then he let out a bellow like an angry bull and dived at Harry, grabbing him by the ankle. \\n \\n      Ron, Fred, and George seized Harry™s arms and pulled as \\nhard as they could.  \\n      ﬁPetunia!ﬂ roared Uncle Vernon. ﬁHe™s getting away! \\nHE™S GETTING AWAY!ﬂ \\n \\n      But the Weasleys gave a gigantic tug and Harry™s leg slid out of Uncle Vernon™s grasp Š Harry was in the car Š he™d slammed the door shut Š        ﬁPut your foot down, Fred!ﬂ yelled Ron, and the car shot suddenly toward the moon. \\n       Harry couldn™t believe it Š he was free. He rolled down the window, the night air whipping his hair, and looked back at the shrinking rooftops of Privet Drive. Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley were all hanging, dumbst\\nruck, out of Harry™s window.  \\n      ﬁSee you next summer!ﬂ Harry yelled. \\n\\n \\n      The Weasleys roared with\\n laughter and Harry settled back in his seat, grinning from ear to ear.  \\n      ﬁLet Hedwig out,ﬂ he told Ron. ﬁShe can fly behind us. She hasn™t had a chance to stretch her \\nwings for ages.ﬂ  \\n      George handed the hairpin to Ron and, a mo\\nment later, Hedwig soared joyfully out of the \\nwindow to glide alongside them like a ghost. \\n \\n      ﬁSo Š what™s the story, Harry?ﬂ sa\\nid Ron impatiently. ﬁWh\\nat™s been happening?ﬂ  \\n      Harry told them all about Dobby, the warnin\\ng he™d given Harry and the fiasco of the violet pudding. There was a long, shocked silence when he had finished.       ﬁVery fishy,ﬂ said Fred finally.  \\n      ﬁDefinitely dodgyﬂ agreed George. ﬁSo he wouldn™t even tell you who™s supposed to be plotting all this stuff?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁI don™t think he could,ﬂ said Harry. ﬁI told you, every time he got close to letting something \\nslip, he started banging his head against the wall.ﬂ \\n \\n      He saw Fred and George look at each other. \\n \\n      ﬁWhat, you think he was lying to me?ﬂ said Harry. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁWell,ﬂ said Fred, ﬁput it this way Š house-\\nelves have got powerful magic of their own, but they \\ncan™t usually use it without their master™s pe\\nrmission. I reckon old Dobby was sent to stop you \\ncoming back to Hogwarts. Someone™s idea of a j\\noke. Can you think of anyone at school with a grudge against you?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁYes,ﬂ said Harry and Ron together, instantly. \\n \\n      ﬁDraco Malfoy,ﬂ Harry explained. ﬁHe hates me.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁDraco Malfoy?ﬂ said George, turning around. ﬁNot Lucius Malfoy™s son?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁMust be, it™s not a very common name, is it?ﬂ said Harry. \\n \\n      ﬁI™ve heard Dad talking about him,ﬂ said George. ﬁHe was a big supporter of You-Know-Who.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁAnd when You-Know-Who disappeared,ﬂ sa\\nid Fred, craning around to look at Harry, ﬁLucius Malfoy came back saying he™d never meant any of\\n it. Load of dung Š Dad reckons he was right in You- Know-Who™s inner circle.ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry had heard these rumo\\nrs about Malfoy™s family before, and they didn™t surprise him at all. \\nMalfoy made Dudley Dursley look like \\na kind, thoughtful, and sensitive boy–   \\n      ﬁI don™t know whether the Malfoys own a house-elf–ﬂ said Harry. \\n \\n      ﬁWell, whoever owns him will be an old \\nwizarding family, and they™ll be rich,ﬂ said Fred. \\n \\n      ﬁYeah, Mum™s always wishing we had a hous\\ne-elf to do the ironing,ﬂ said George. ﬁBut all we™ve got is a lousy old ghoul in the attic and gnomes all over the gard\\nen. House-elves come \\nwith big old manors and castles and places like that; you wouldn™t catch one in our house–ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry was silent. Judging by the fact that Draco Malfoy usually had the best of everything, his family was rolling in wizard gol\\nd; he could just see Malfoy strutting around a large manor house. \\nSending the family servant to stop Harry from go\\ning back to Hogwarts also sounded exactly like \\nthe sort of thing Malfoy would do. Had Harry been stupid to take Dobby seriously? \\n      ﬁI™m glad we came to get you, anyway,ﬂ sa\\nid Ron. ﬁI was getting really worried when you didn™t answer any of my letters. I thought \\nit was Errol™s fault at first Šﬂ        ﬁWho™s Errol?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁOur owl. He™s ancient. It wouldn™t be the first time he™d collapsed on\\n a delivery. So then I tried to borrow Hermes Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWho?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁThe owl Mum and Dad bought Percy when he\\n was made prefect,ﬂ said\\n Fred from the front.  \\n      ﬁBut Percy wouldn™t lend him to\\n me,ﬂ said Ron. ﬁSaid he needed him.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁPercy™s been acting very oddly this summer,ﬂ said George, frowning. ﬁAnd he \\nhas been sending a lot of letters and spending a load of time s\\nhut up in his room– I mean, there™s only so many \\ntimes you can polish a prefect badge– You™re drivi\\nng too far west, Fred,ﬂ he added, pointing at a compass on the dashboard. Fred twiddled the steering wheel. \\n \\n      ﬁSo, does your dad know you™ve got the car?ﬂ said Harry, guessing the answer. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁEr, no,ﬂ said Ron, ﬁhe had to work tonight. Hopefully we™ll be able to get it back in the garage without Mum noticing we flew it.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁWhat does your dad do at \\nthe Ministry of Magic, anyway?ﬂ \\n       ﬁHe works in the most boring department,ﬂ\\n said Ron. ﬁThe Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office.ﬂ        ﬁThe what?ﬂ  \\n      ﬁIt™s all to do with bewitching things that are Muggle-made\\n, you know, in case they end up back in a Muggle shop or house. Like, last year, some \\nold witch died and her tea set was sold to an antiques shop. This Muggle woman bought it, took it \\nhome, and tried to serve her friends tea in \\nit. It was a nightmare Š Dad wa\\ns working overtime for weeks.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWhat happened?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁThe teapot went berserk and squirted boiling tea all over the place and one man ended up in the \\nhospital with the sugar tongs clamped to his nos\\ne. Dad was going frantic Š it™s only him and an \\nold warlock called Perkins in the office Š and they had to do Memory Charms and all sorts of \\nstuff to cover it up Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁBut your dad Š this car Šﬂ \\n \\n      Fred laughed. ﬁYeah, Dad™s crazy about everything to do with Muggles; our shed™s full of Muggle stuff. He takes it apart, puts spells on \\nit, and puts it back together again. If he raided our house he™d have to put himself unde\\nr arrest. It drives Mum mad.ﬂ \\n       ﬁThat™s the main road,ﬂ said George, \\npeering down through the windshield. ﬁWe™ll be there in \\nten minutes– Just as well, it™s getting light–ﬂ \\n \\n      A faint pinkish glow was visible along the horizon to the east.  \\n      Fred brought the car lower, and Harry saw a dark patchwork of fields and clumps of trees. \\n \\n      ﬁWe™re a little way outside the v\\nillage,ﬂ said George. ﬁOttery St. Catchpole.ﬂ  \\n      Lower and lower went the flying car. The edge of a brilliant red \\nsun was now gleaming through \\nthe trees.  \\n      ﬁTouchdown!ﬂ said Fred as, with a slight bump, they hit the ground. They had landed next to a tumbledown garage in a small yard, and Harry \\nlooked out for the first time at Ron™s house. \\n \\n      It looked as though it had once been a large stone pigpen, but extra rooms had been added here \\nand there until it was several stories high and so crooked it looked as though it were held up by \\n\\nmagic (which Harry reminded himself, it probably \\nwas). Four or five chimneys were perched on top of the red roof. A lopsided sign stuck in the ground near the entrance read, THE BURROW. \\nAround the front door lay a jumble of rubber boots \\nand a very rusty cauldron. Several fat brown \\nchickens were pecking their way around the yard.  \\n      ﬁIt™s not much,ﬂ said Ron. \\n       ﬁIt™s wonderful,ﬂ said Harry happily, thinking of Privet Drive.        They got out of the car. \\n \\n      ﬁNow, we™ll go upstairs really quietly,ﬂ said Fred, ﬁand wait for Mum to call us for breakfast \\nThen, Ron, you come bounding downstairs going, ‚M\\num, look who turned up in the night!™ and \\n\\nshe™ll be all pleased to see Harry and no one need ever know we flew the car.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁRight,ﬂ said Ron. ﬁCome on, \\nHarry, I sleep at the Š at the top Šﬂ  \\n      Ron had gone a nasty greenish color, his eyes fixed on the house. The other three wheeled around.  \\n      Mrs. Weasley was marching across the yar\\nd, scattering chickens, and for a short, plump, kind-\\nfaced woman, it was remarkable how much \\nshe looked like a saber-toothed tiger. \\n \\n      ﬁAh, ﬁsaid Fred.  \\n      ﬁOh, dear,ﬂ said George. \\n       Mrs. Weasley came to a halt in front of th\\nem, her hands on her hips, st\\naring from one guilty face \\nto the next. She was wearing a flowered ap\\nron with a wand sticking out of the pocket.        ﬁSo,ﬂ she said.  \\n      ﬁMorning, Mum,ﬂ said George, in wh\\nat he clearly thought was a jaunty, winning voice.  \\n      ﬁHave you any idea how worried I™ve been?ﬂ said Mrs. \\nWeasley in a deadly whisper.  \\n      ﬁSorry, Mum, but see, we had to Šﬂ \\n\\n \\n      All three of Mrs. Weasley™s sons were talle\\nr than she was, but they cowered as her rage broke over them. \\n \\n      ﬁBeds empty! No note! Car gone Š could have crashed Š out of my mind with worry Š did \\nyou care? Š never, as long as I™ve lived Š you wa\\nit until your father gets home, we never had \\ntrouble like this from Bill or Charlie or Percy Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁPerfect Percy,ﬂ muttered Fred. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁYOU COULD DO WITH TAKING A LE\\nAF OUT OF PERCY™S BOOK!ﬂ yelled Mrs. \\nWeasley, prodding a finger in Fred™s chest. ﬁYou could have died, you could have been seen, you could have lost your father his job Šﬂ  \\n      It seemed to go on for hours. Mrs. Weas\\nley had shouted herself hoarse before she turned on Harry, who backed away.  \\n      ﬁI™m very pleased to see you, Harry, dear\\n,ﬂ she said. ﬁCome in and have some breakfast.ﬂ \\n \\n      She turned and walked back into the house and Harry, after a nervous glance at Ron, who nodded encouragingly, followed her.  \\n      The kitchen was small and rather cramped. \\nThere was a scrubbed wooden table and chairs in the middle, and Harry sat down on the edge of hi\\ns seat, looking around. He had never been in a wizard house before.  \\n      The clock on the wall opposite him had only one hand and no numbers at all. Written around the \\nedge were things like Time to make tea, Time to feed the chickens\\n, and You™re late\\n. Books were stacked three deep on the mant\\nelpiece, books with titles like Charm Your Own Cheese, \\nEnchantment in Baking, and One Minute Feasts Š It™s Magic! And unless Harry™s ears were \\ndeceiving him, the old radio next to the sink \\nhad just announced that coming up was ﬁWitching \\nHour, with the popular singing sorceress, Celestina Warbeck.ﬂ \\n \\n      Mrs. Weasley was clattering around, cooking \\nbreakfast a little haphazardly, throwing dirty looks at her sons as she threw sausages into the fr\\nying pan. Every now and then she muttered things \\nlike ﬁdon™t know what you were thinking of,ﬂ and ﬁnever would have believed it.ﬂ       ﬁI don™t blame \\nyou, dear,ﬂ she assured Harry, tipping eight or nine sausages onto his plate. ﬁArthur and I have been worried about you, too. Just last night we were saying we™d come and \\nget you ourselves if you hadn™t written back to Ron by Friday. But really,ﬂ (she was now adding three fried eggs to his plate) \\nﬁflying an illegal car halfway ac\\nross the country Š anyone could have seen you Šﬂ        She flicked her wand casually at the dishes in the sink, which began to clean themselves, \\nclinking gently in the background.  \\n      ﬁIt was cloudy, Mum!ﬂ said Fred. \\n \\n      ﬁYou keep your mouth closed while you™re eating!ﬂ Mr\\ns. Weasley snapped.  \\n      ﬁThey were starving him, Mum!ﬂ said George. \\n \\n      ﬁAnd you!ﬂ said Mrs. Weasley, but it was with a slightly softened expression that she started \\ncutting Harry bread and buttering it for him. \\n \\n      At that moment there was a diversion in\\n the form of a small, redheaded figure in a long \\nnightdress, who appeared in the kitchen, gave a small squeal, and ran out again. \\n \\n      ﬁGinny,ﬂ said Ron in an undertone to Harry. ﬁMy sister. She™s been talking about you all summer.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁYeah, she™ll be wanting your autograph, Harry,ﬂ Fred said with a grin, but he caught his mother™s eye and bent his face over his plate wi\\nthout another word. Nothing more was said until \\nall four plates were clean, which took a surprisingly short time. \\n \\n      ﬁBlimey, I™m tired,ﬂ yawned Fred, setting down his kni\\nfe and fork at last. ﬁI think I™ll go to bed and Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁYou will not,ﬂ snapped Mrs. Weasley. ﬁI\\nt™s your own fault you™ve been up all night. You™re \\ngoing to de-gnome the garden for me; they™re\\n getting completely out of hand again Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁOh, Mum Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁAnd you two,ﬂ she said, glaring at Ron and Fred. ﬁYou can go up to bed, dear,ﬂ she added to Harry. ﬁYou didn™t ask them to fly that wretched car Šﬂ \\n \\n      But Harry, who felt wide awake, said quickly, ﬁI™ll help Ron. I™ve never seen a de-gnoming Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁThat™s very sweet of you, dear, but it™s dull work,ﬂ said Mrs. Weasley. ﬁNow, let™s see what \\nLockhart™s got to say on the subject Šﬂ  \\n      And she pulled a heavy book from the stack on the mantelpie\\nce. George groaned.        ﬁMum, we know how to de-gnome a garden Šﬂ \\n \\n      Harry looked at the cover of Mrs. Weas\\nley™s book. Written across it in \\nfancy gold letters were the words Gilderoy Lockhart™s Guide to Household Pests. There was a big photograph on the front of a very good-looking wizard with wavy blond hair and bright blue eyes. As always in the wizarding world, the photograph was moving; th\\ne wizard, who Harry supposed was Gilderoy Lockhart, kept winking cheekily up at them a\\nll. Mrs. Weasley beamed down at him. \\n \\n      ﬁOh, he is marvelous,ﬂ she said. ﬁHe know\\ns his household pests, all right, it™s a wonderful book–ﬂ  \\n      ﬁMum \\nfancies\\n him,ﬂ said Fred, in a very audible whisper. \\n \\n      ﬁDon™t be so ridiculous, Fred,ﬂ said Mrs. Weasley, her cheeks rather \\npink. ﬁAll right, if you think you know better than Lockhart, you can go and get on with it, and woe betide you if there™s a single gnome in that garden when I come out to inspect it.ﬂ \\n \\n      Yawning and grumbling, the Weasleys sl\\nouched outside with Harry behind them. The garden \\nwas large, and in Harry™s eyes, exactly what a garden should be. The Dursleys wouldn™t have liked it Š there were plenty of weeds, and th\\ne grass needed cutting Š but there were gnarled \\ntrees all around the walls, plants Harry had never seen spilling from every flower bed, and a big \\ngreen pond full of frogs.  \\n      ﬁMuggles have garden gnomes, too, you \\nknow,ﬂ Harry told Ron they crossed the lawn.  \\n      ﬁYeah, I™ve seen those things they think are gnomes,ﬂ said Ron, bent\\n double with his head in a peony bush, ﬁlike fat little Santa Clauses with fishing rods–ﬂ  \\n      There was a violent scuffling noise, the peony bush shuddered, and Ron straightened up. ﬁ\\nThis is a gnome,ﬂ he said grimly. \\n \\n      ﬁGerroff me! Gerroff me!ﬂ squealed the gnome. \\n\\n \\n      It was certainly nothing like Santa Claus. It was small and leathery looking, with a large, knobby, \\nbald head exactly like a potato. R\\non held it at arm™s length as it kicked out at him with its horny \\n\\nlittle feet; he grasped it around the ankles and turned it upside down.  \\n      ﬁThis is what you have to do,ﬂ he said. He raised the gnome above his head (ﬁGerroff me!ﬂ) and \\nstarted to swing it in great circles like a lasso. Seeing the shocked look on Harry™s face, Ron added, ﬁIt doesn™t hurt them Šyou™ve just got to make them \\nreally dizzy so they can™t find their way back to the gnome holes.ﬂ \\n \\n      He let go of the gnome™s ankles: It flew tw\\nenty feet into the air and landed with a thud in the field over the hedge.  \\n      ﬁPitiful,ﬂ said Fred. ﬁI \\nbet I can get mine beyond that stump.ﬂ \\n      Harry learned quickly not to feel too sorry for the gnomes. He decided just to drop the first one \\nhe caught over the hedge, but the gnome, sensi\\nng weakness, sank its razor-sharp teeth into Harry™s finger and he had a hard job shaking it off Š until Š \\n       ﬁWow, Harry Š that must™ve been fifty feet–ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      The air was soon thick with flying gnomes. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁSee, they™re not too bright,ﬂ said George, seizing five or six gnomes at once. ﬁThe moment they \\nknow the de-gnoming™s going on they storm up to ha\\nve a look. You™d think they™d have learned by now just to stay put.ﬂ  \\n      Soon, the crowd of gnomes in the field star\\nted walking away in a straggling line, their little shoulders hunched.  \\n      ﬁThey™ll be back,ﬂ said Ron as they watched the gnomes disappear into the hedge on the other \\nside of the field. ﬁThey love it here– Dad™s too soft with them; he thinks they™re funny–ﬂ \\n \\n      Just then, the front door slammed. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁHe™s back!ﬂ said George. ﬁDad™s home!ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      They hurried through the garden and back into the house.  \\n      Mr. Weasley was slumped in a kitchen chair \\nwith his glasses off and his eyes closed. He was a thin man, going bald, but the little hair he had \\nwas as red as any of his children™s. He was wearing long green robes, which were dusty and travel-worn.  \\n      ﬁWhat a night,ﬂ he mumbled, groping for \\nthe teapot as they all sat down around him. ﬁNine \\nraids. Nine! And old Mundungus Fletcher tried to put a hex on me when I had my back \\nturned–ﬂ  \\n      Mr. Weasley took a long gulp of tea and sighed. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁFind anything, Dad?ﬂ said Fred eagerly. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁAll I got were a few shrinking door keys and a biting kettle,ﬂ yawned Mr. Weasley. ﬁThere was \\nsome pretty nasty stuff that wasn™t my de\\npartment, though. Mortlake was taken away for questioning about some extremely odd ferrets, \\nbut that™s the Committee on Experimental \\nCharms, thank goodness–ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWhy would anyone bother making door keys shrink?ﬂ said George. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁJust Muggle-baiting,ﬂ sighed Mr. Weasley. ﬁSell them a key th\\nat keeps shrinking to nothing so they can never find it when they need it.. Of course, it™s very hard to convict anyone because no Muggle would admit their key keeps shrinking Š they\\n™ll insist they just keep losing it. Bless them, they™ll go to any lengths to ignore magic, \\neven if it™s staring them in the face– But the \\nthings our lot have taken to enchanting, you wouldn™t believe Šﬂ        ﬁLIKE CARS, FOR INSTANCE?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      Mrs. Weasley had appear\\ned, holding a long poker like a sword. Mr. Weasley™s eyes jerked open. He stared guiltily at his wife.  \\n      ﬁC-cars, Molly, dear?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁYes, Arthur, cars,ﬂ said Mrs. Weasley, \\nher eyes flashing. ﬁImagine a wizard buying a rusty old \\ncar and telling his wife all he wanted to do with it was take it apart to see how it worked, while really he was enchanting it to make it \\nfly.ﬂ  \\n      Mr. Weasley blinked. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁWell, dear, I think you™ll \\nfind that he would be quite within the law to do that, even if Š er Š he maybe would have done better to, um, tell hi\\ns wife the truth– There™s a loophole in the law, you™ll find– As long as he wasn™t intending to fly the car, the fact that the car \\ncould\\n fly wouldn™t Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁArthur Weasley, you ma\\nde sure there was a loophole when you wrote that law!ﬂ shouted Mrs. Weasley. ﬁJust so you could carry on tinkering with all that Muggle rubbish in your shed! And for your information, Harry arrived this morni\\nng in the car you weren™t intending to fly!ﬂ  \\n      ﬁHarry?ﬂ said Mr. Weasley blankly. ﬁHarry who?ﬂ \\n \\n      He looked around, saw Harry, and jumped. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁGood lord, is it Harry Potter? Very plea\\nsed to meet you, Ron™s told us so much about Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁYour sons flew that car to Harry™s house and back last night!ﬂ shouted Mrs. Weasley. ﬁWhat \\nhave you got to say about that, eh?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁDid you really?ﬂ said Mr. Weasley eagerl\\ny. ﬁDid it go all right? I Š \\nI mean,ﬂ he faltered as \\nsparks flew from Mrs. Weasley™s eyes, ﬁt\\nhat Š that was very wrong, boys Š very wrong indeed–ﬂ  \\n      ﬁLet™s leave them to it,ﬂ Ron muttered to\\n Harry as Mrs. Weasley swelled like a bullfrog. ﬁCome on, I™ll show you my bedroom.ﬂ \\n \\n      They slipped out of the kitchen and down a narrow passageway to an uneven staircase, which wound its way, zigzagging up through the house. On the third landing, a door stood ajar. Harry just caught sight of a pair of bright brown eyes staring at him before it closed with a snap. \\n \\n      ﬁGinny,ﬂ said Ron. ﬁYou don™t know how weird it is for her to be this shy. She never shuts up normally Šﬂ \\n       They climbed two more flights until they \\nreached a door with peeling \\npaint and a small plaque \\non it, saying RONALD™S ROOM. \\n \\n      Harry stepped in, his head almost touc\\nhing the sloping ceiling, and blinked. It was like walking into a furnace: Nearly everything in Ron™s room seemed to be \\na violent shade of orange: the bedspread, the walls, even the ceiling. Then Harry realized that\\n Ron had covered nearly every inch of the shabby wallpaper with posters of the same seven \\nwitches and wizards, all wearing bright orange robes, carrying broomsticks, and waving energetically. \\n \\n      ﬁYour Quidditch team?ﬂ said Harry. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁThe Chudley Cannons,ﬂ said Ron, pointing at the orange bedspread, which was emblazoned with two giant black C™s and a speeding cannonball. ﬁNinth in the league.ﬂ  \\n      Ron™s school spellbooks were stacked untidily in a corner, next to a pile of comics that all \\nseemed to feature \\nThe Adventures of Martin Miggs, the Mad Muggle. Ron™s magic wand was \\nlying on top of a fish tank full of frog spawn on the windowsill, next to his fat gray rat, Scabbers, \\n\\nwho was snoozing in a patch of sun.  \\n      Harry stepped over a pack of Self-Shuffling playing cards on the floor and looked out of the tiny window. In the field far below he could see a gang of gnomes sneaking one by one back through \\nthe Weasleys™ hedge. Then he turned to look at\\n Ron, who was watching him almost nervously, as \\nthough waiting for his opinion.        ﬁIt™s a bit small,ﬂ said Ron quickly. ﬁNot li\\nke that room you had with\\n the Muggles. And I™m right \\nunderneath the ghoul in the attic; he™s always banging on the pipes and groaning–ﬂ        But Harry, grinning widely, said, ﬁThis is the best house I™ve ever been in.ﬂ  \\n      Ron™s ears went pink. \\n \\n            \\n    \\n \\n \\n \\n CHAPTER FOUR \\n  At Flourish and Blotts \\n \\n  Life at the Burrow was as different as possibl\\ne from life on Privet Drive. The Dursleys liked \\neverything neat and ordered; the Weasleys™ house\\n burst with the strange and unexpected. Harry got a shock the first time he looked in the mirro\\nr over the kitchen mantelpiece and it shouted, \\nﬁTuck your shirt in, scruffy!ﬂ\\n The ghoul in the attic howled and dropped pipes whenever he felt things were getting too quiet, and small explosions from Fred and George™s bedroom were \\nconsidered perfectly normal. What Harry found \\nmost unusual about life at Ron™s, however, \\nwasn™t the talking mirror or the clanking ghoul: It\\n was the fact that everybody there seemed to \\nlike him. \\n \\n      Mrs. Weasley fussed over the state of his sock\\ns and tried to force him to\\n eat fourth helpings at every meal. Mr. Weasley liked Harry to sit next \\nto him at the dinner table so that he could \\n\\nbombard him with questions about life with Mu\\nggles, asking him to explain how things like \\nplugs and the postal service worked.  \\n      ﬁFascinating\\n.ﬂ he would say as Harry talk\\ned him through using a telephone. ﬁ\\nIngenious, really, how many ways Muggles have found \\nof getting along without magic.ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry heard from Hogwar\\nts one sunny morning about a week af\\nter he had arrived at the Burrow. He and Ron went down to breakfast to find Mr. and Mrs. Weasley and Ginny already sitting at \\nthe kitchen table. The moment she saw Harr\\ny, Ginny accidentally knocked her porridge bowl to the floor with a loud clatter. Ginny seemed very\\n prone to knocking things over whenever Harry entered a room. She dived under the table to \\nretrieve the bowl and emerged with her face \\nglowing like the setting sun. Pretending he hadn™t noticed this, Harry sat down and took the toast Mrs. Weasley offered him. \\n \\n      ﬁLetters from school,ﬂ said Mr. Weas\\nley, passing Harry and Ron identical envelopes of yellowish parchment, addressed in green ink. \\nﬁDumbledore already knows you™re here, Harry Š doesn™t miss a trick, that man. You two™ve got them\\n, too,ﬂ he added, as Fred and George ambled \\nin, still in their pajamas. \\n \\n      For a few minutes there was silence as they \\nall read their letters. Harry™s told him to catch the \\nHogwarts Express as usual from King™s Cross stat\\nion on September first. There was also a list of \\nthe new books he™d need for the coming year.    SECOND-YEAR STUDENTS WILL REQUIRE:    The Standard Book of Spells\\n, Grade 2by Miranda Goshawk  \\n  Break with a Banshee by Gilderoy Lockhart \\n\\n   \\nGadding with Ghouls by Gilderoy Lockhart   Holidays with Hags by Gilderoy Lockhart \\n \\n  43 Travels with Trolls by Gilderoy Lockhart \\n\\n \\n  Voyages with Vampires by Gilderoy Lockhart \\n\\n \\n  Wanderings with Werewolves by Gilderoy Lockhart \\n\\n \\n  Year with the Yeti by Gilderoy Lockhart \\n       Fred, who had finished his own list, peered over at Harry™s. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁYou™ve been told to get all Lockhart™s books, too!ﬂ he said. ﬁThe new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher must be a fan Š bet it™s a witch.ﬂ  \\n      At this point, Fred caught his mother™s \\neye and quickly busied hims\\nelf with the marmalade. \\n \\n      ﬁThat lot won™t come cheap,ﬂ said George\\n, with a quick look at his parents. ﬁLockhart™s books are really expensive–ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWell, we™ll manage,ﬂ said Mrs. Weasley, but \\nshe looked worried. ﬁI expect we™ll be able to pick up a lot of Ginny™s things secondhand.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁOh, are you starting at Hogwarts this year?ﬂ Harry asked Ginny. \\n \\n      She nodded, blushing to the roots of her flaming hair, and put her elbow in the butter dish. Fortunately no one saw this except Harry, because just then Ron™s elder brother Percy walked in. \\n\\nHe was already dressed, his Hogwarts prefect badge pinned to his sweater vest. \\n \\n      ﬁMorning, all,ﬂ said Percy briskly. ﬁLovely day.ﬂ \\n \\n      He sat down in the only remaining chai\\nr but leapt up again almost immediately, pulling from \\nunderneath him a molting, gray feat\\nher duster Š at least, that \\nwas what Harry thought it was, \\nuntil he saw that it was breathing. \\n \\n      ﬁErrol!ﬂ said Ron, taking the limp owl from Percy and extrac\\nting a letter from under its wing. \\nﬁFinallyŠ he™s got Hermione™s answer. I wrote to he\\nr saying we were going to try and rescue you from the Dursleys.ﬂ \\n \\n      He carried Errol to a perch just inside the back door and tried to stand him on it, but Errol \\nflopped straight off again so Ron lay him on th\\ne draining board instead, muttering, ﬁPathetic.ﬂ \\nThen he ripped open Hermione™s letter and read it out loud: \\n \\n      ﬁ`Dear Ron, and Harry if you™re there,        ﬁ`I hope everything went all right and that \\nHarry is okay and that you didn™t do anything illegal \\nto get him out, Ron, because that would get Harry into trouble, too. I™ve been really worried and \\nif Harry is all right, will you please let me know at once, but perhaps it would be better if you \\nused a different owl because I think another delivery mi\\nght finish your one off.        ﬁI™m very busy with schoolwork, of course™Š How can she be?ﬂ said Ron in horror. ﬁWe™re on \\nvacation! Š‚and we™re going to London next Wednesday to buy my new books. Why don™t we meet in Diagon Alley?        Let me know what™s happening as soon as you can. Love from Hermione.™ﬂ        ﬁWell, that fits in nicely, we can go and ge\\nt all your things then, too,ﬂ said Mrs. Weasley, starting to clear the table. ﬁWhat\\n™re you all up to today?ﬂ  \\n      Harry, Ron, Fred, and George were planni\\nng to go up the hill to a small paddock the Weasleys \\nowned. It was surrounded by trees that blocked it from view of th\\ne village below, meaning that \\nthey could practice Quidditch there, as long as they didn™t fly too high.  \\n      They couldn™t use real Quidditch balls, which would have been hard to explain if they had escaped and flown away over the village; instead \\nthey threw apples for one another to catch. They took turns riding Harry™s Nimbus Two Thou\\nsand, which was easily the best broom; Ron™s \\nold Shooting Star was often outstripped by passing butterflies. \\n \\n      Five minutes later they were marching up \\nthe hill, broomsticks over their shoulders. They had \\nasked Percy if he wanted to join them, but he had said he was busy. Harry had only seen Percy at mealtimes so far; he stayed shut in his room the rest of the time. \\n       ﬁWish I knew what he was up to,ﬂ said Fre\\nd, frowning. ﬁHe™s not himself.\\n His exam results came \\nthe day before you did; twelve O.W.L.\\ns and he hardly gloated at all.ﬂ        ﬁOrdinary Wizarding Levels,ﬂ George e\\nxplained, seeing Harry™s puzzl\\ned look. ﬁBill got twelve, too. If we™re not careful, we™ll have another Head Boy in the family. I don™t think I could stand \\nthe shame.ﬂ \\n \\n      Bill was the oldest Weasley brother. He and \\nthe next brother, Charlie, had already left Hogwarts. \\nHarry had never met either of them, but knew th\\nat Charlie was in Romania studying dragons and \\nBill in Egypt working for the wizard™s bank, Gringotts. \\n \\n      ﬁDunno how Mum and Dad are going to afford al\\nl our school stuff this year,ﬂ said George after a \\nwhile. ﬁFive sets of Lockhart books! And Ginny needs robes and a wand and everything–ﬂ  \\n      Harry said nothing. He felt a bit awkward. Stored in an underground vault at Gringotts in London was a small fortune that his pare\\nnts had left him. Of course, it\\n was only in the wizarding world that he had money; you couldn™t use Galleons, Sickles, and Knuts in Muggle shops. He had \\nnever mentioned his Gringotts bank account to th\\ne Dursleys; he didn™t think their horror of anything connected with magic would \\nstretch to a large pile of gold.      Mrs. Weasley woke them all early the follo\\nwing Wednesday. After a qui\\nck half a dozen bacon sandwiches each, they pulled on their coats and Mrs. Weasley took a flowerpot off the kitchen \\nmantelpiece and peered inside. \\n       ﬁWe™re running low, Arthur,ﬂ she sighe\\nd. ﬁWe™ll have to buy some more today– Ah well, \\nguests first! After you, Harry dear!ﬂ  \\n      And she offered him the flowerpot. \\n\\n \\n      Harry stared at them all watching him. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁW-what am I supposed to do?ﬂ he stammered. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁHe™s never traveled by Floo powder,ﬂ said Ron suddenly. ﬁSorry, Harry, I forgot.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁNever?ﬂ said Mr. Weasley. ﬁBut how did you get to Diagon Alley to buy your school things last year?ﬂ  \\n      ﬁI went on the Underground Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁReally?ﬂ said Mr. Weasley eagerly. ﬁWere there \\nescapators\\n? How exactly Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁNot now, Arthur,ﬂ said Mrs. Weasley. ﬁFloo powder™s a lot quicker, dear, but goodness me, if \\nyou™ve never used it before Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁHe™ll be all right, Mum,ﬂ \\nsaid Fred. ﬁHarry, watch us first.ﬂ  \\n      He took a pinch of glittering powder out of\\n the flowerpot, stepped up to the fire, and threw the powder into the flames. \\n \\n      With a roar, the fire turned emerald green \\nand rose higher than Fred, who stepped right into it, shouted, ﬁDiagon Alley!ﬂ and vanished.  \\n      ﬁYou must speak clearly, dear,ﬂ Mrs. Weasley told Harry as George dipped his hand into the \\nflowerpot. ﬁAnd be sure to get out at the right grate–ﬂ  \\n      ﬁThe right what?ﬂ said Harry nervously as \\nthe fire roared and whipped George out of sight, too.  \\n      ﬁWell, there are an awful lot of wizard \\nfires to choose from, you know,\\n but as long as you™ve spoken clearly Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁHe™ll be fine, Molly, don™t fuss,ﬂ said Mr. Weasley, helping himself to Floo powder too. \\n \\n      ﬁBut, dear, if he got lost, how would we ever explain to his aunt and uncle?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁThey wouldn™t mind,ﬂ Harry reassured her. \\nﬁDudley would think it was a brilliant joke if I got lost up a chimney, don™t worry about that Šﬂ        ﬁWell– all right– you go af\\nter Arthur,ﬂ said Mrs. Weasley. \\nﬁNow, when you get into the fire, say where you™re going.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁAnd keep your elbows tucked in,ﬂ Ron advised. \\n \\n      ﬁAnd your eyes shut,ﬂ said Mrs. Weasley. ﬁThe soot Šﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁDon™t fidget,ﬂ said Ron. ﬁOr you mi\\nght well fall out of the wrong fireplace Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁBut don™t panic and get out to\\no early; wait until you see Fred and George.ﬂ \\n \\n      Trying hard to bear all this in mind, Harry\\n took a pinch of Floo powder and walked to the edge of the fire. He took a deep breath, scattered the powder into the flames, and stepped forward; the \\nfire felt like a warm breeze; he opened his mout\\nh and immediately swallowed a lot of hot ash. \\n \\n      ﬁD-Dia-gon Alley,ﬂ he coughed. \\n \\n      It felt as though he was being sucked down a giant drain. He seemed to \\nbe spinning very fast Š the roaring in his ears was deafening Š he tried to keep his eyes open but the whirl of green flames made him feel sick Šsomething hard knock\\ned his elbow and he tucked it in tightly, still spinning and spinning Š now it fe\\nlt as though cold hands were slapping his face Š squinting through his glasses he saw a blurred stream of fireplaces and sn\\natched glimpses of the rooms \\nbeyond Š his bacon sandwiches were churning inside him Š he clos\\ned his eyes again wishing it would stop, and then–   \\n      He fell, face forward, onto cold st\\none and felt the bridge of his glasses snap. \\n \\n      Dizzy and bruised, covered in soot, he got gingerly to his feet, holding his broken glasses up to his eyes. He was quite alone, but where he was, he had no idea. All he could tell was that he was standing in the stone fireplace of what looked like a large, dimly lit wizard™s shop Š but nothing \\nin here was ever likely to be on a Hogwarts school list.  \\n      A glass case nearby held a withered hand on a cushion, a bloodstained pack of cards, and a staring glass eye. Evil-looking masks stared dow\\nn from the walls, an assortment of human bones \\nlay upon the counter, and rusty, spiked instruments hung from the ceiling. Even worse, the dark, \\nnarrow street Harry could see through the dusty shop window was definitely not Diagon Alley.  \\n      The sooner he got out of here, the better. Nose still stinging where it had hit the hearth, Harry made his way swiftly and silently toward the do\\nor, but before he™d got halfway toward it, two people appeared on the other side of the glass Š and one of them was the very last person Harry \\nwanted to meet when he was lost, covered in soot, and wearing broken glasses: Draco Malfoy.  \\n      Harry looked quickly around and spotted a large black cabinet to his left; he shot inside it and pulled the doors closed, leaving a small crack to peer through. Seconds later, a bell clanged, and Malfoy stepped into the shop.        The man who followed could only be Draco™s father. He had the same pale, pointed face and \\nidentical cold, gray eyes. Mr. Malfoy crossed the shop, looking lazily at the items on display, and \\nrang a bell on the counter before turning to his son and saying, ﬁTouch nothing, Draco.ﬂ  \\n      Malfoy, who had reached for the glass eye, said, ﬁI thought you were going to buy me a present.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁI said I would buy you a racing broom,ﬂ said his father, dr\\numming his fingers on the counter. \\n \\n      ﬁWhat™s the good of that if I™m not on \\nthe House team?ﬂ said Malfoy, looking sulky and bad-\\ntempered. ﬁHarry Potter got a Nimbus Two Th\\nousand last year. Special permission from \\n\\nDumbledore so he could play fo\\nr Gryffindor. He™s not even that good, it™s just because he™s famous– famous for having a stupid scar on his forehead–ﬂ  \\n      Malfoy bent down to examine a shelf full of skulls. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁ– everyone thinks he™s so smart, wonderful \\nPotter with his scar and his broomstick Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁYou have told me this at least a dozen \\ntimes already,ﬂ said Mr. Ma\\nlfoy, with a quelling look at his son. ﬁAnd I would remind you that it is not \\nŠ prudent Š to appear less than fond of Harry Potter, not when most of our kind regard him as the hero who made the Dark Lord disappear Š \\n\\nah, Mr. Borgin.ﬂ  \\n      A stooping man had appeared behind the coun\\nter, smoothing his greasy hair back from his face. \\n       ﬁMr. Malfoy, what a pleasure to see you again,ﬂ said Mr. Borgin in a voice as oily as his hair. ﬁDelighted Š and young Master Malfoy, too Š charmed. How may I be of assistance? I must \\nshow you, just in today, and very reasonably priced Šﬂ        ﬁI™m not buying today, Mr. Bo\\nrgin, but selling,ﬂ said Mr. Malfoy.  \\n      ﬁSelling?ﬂ The smile fade\\nd slightly from Mr. Borgin™s face. \\n \\n      ﬁYou have heard, of course, that the Ministry is conducting more raids,\\nﬂ said Mr. Malfoy, taking a roll of parchment from his inside pocket and unra\\nveling it for Mr. Borgin to read. ﬁI have a few Š ah Š items at home that might embarra\\nss me, if the Ministry were to call–ﬂ \\n \\n      Mr. Borgin fixed a pair of pince-nez to his nose and looked down the list.  \\n      ﬁThe Ministry wouldn™t presume to trouble yo\\nu, sir, surely?ﬂ \\n \\n      Mr. Malfoy™s lip curled. \\n \\n      ﬁI have not been visited yet. The name Ma\\nlfoy still commands a certain respect, yet the Ministry \\ngrows ever more meddlesome. There are rumo\\nrs about a new Muggle Protection Act Š no doubt \\nthat flea-bitten, Muggle-loving fool Arthur Weasley is behind it Šﬂ \\n       Harry felt a hot surge of anger. \\n \\n      ﬁŠ and as you see, certain of these poisons might make it appear Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁI understand, sir, of course,ﬂ said Mr. Borgin. ﬁLet me see–ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁCan I have that?ﬂ interrupted Draco, pointing at the withered hand on its cushion.  \\n      ﬁAh, the Hand of Glory!ﬂ said Mr. Borgi\\nn, abandoning Mr. Malfoy™s list and scurrying over to Draco. ﬁInsert a candle and it gives light only to the holder! Best friend of thieves and plunderers! Your son has fine taste, sir.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁI hope my son will amount to more than a th\\nief or a plunderer, Borgin,ﬂ said Mr. Malfoy coldly, \\nand Mr. Borgin said quickly, ﬁNo offense, sir, no offense meant Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁThough if his grades don™t pick up,ﬂ said Mr\\n. Malfoy, more coldly still, \\nﬁthat may indeed be all \\nhe is fit for Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁIt™s not my fault,ﬂ retorted Draco. ﬁThe \\nteachers all have favorites, that Hermione Granger Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁI would have thought you™d be ashamed that a girl of no wizard family beat you in every \\nexam,ﬂ snapped Mr. Malfoy. \\n \\n      ﬁHa!ﬂ said Harry under his breath, pleased to see Draco looki\\nng both abashed and angry.  \\n      ﬁIt™s the same all over,ﬂ said Mr. Borgin, \\nin his oily voice. ﬁWizard blood is counting for less \\neverywhere Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁNot with me,ﬂ said Mr\\n. Malfoy, his long nostrils flaring.  \\n      ﬁNo, sir, nor with me, sir,\\nﬂ said Mr. Borgin, with a deep bow.  \\n      ﬁIn that case, perhaps we can return to my \\nlist,ﬂ said Mr. Malfoy shortly. ﬁI am in something of a \\nhurry, Borgin, I have important business elsewhere today Šﬂ \\n \\n      They started to haggle. Harry watched nervously as Draco drew nearer and nearer to his hiding place, examining the objects for sale. Draco paused to examine a long coil of hangman™s rope \\n\\nand to read, smirking, the card propped\\n on a magnificent necklace of opals, \\nCaution: Do Not \\nTouch. Cursed Š Has Claimed the Lives \\nof Nineteen Muggle Owners to Date.  \\n      Draco turned away and saw the cabinet right in front of him. He walked forward Š he stretched out his hand for the handle ﬁDone,ﬂ said Mr. Malfoy at the counter. ﬁCome, Draco Šﬂ  \\n      Harry wiped his forehead on his sleeve as Draco turned away. \\n      ﬁGood day to you, Mr. Borgin. I™ll expect you at the manor tomorrow to pick up the goods.ﬂ \\n \\n      The moment the door had closed, Mr. Borgin dropped his oily manner. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁGood day yourself, Mister Malfoy, and if the stories are true, you haven™t sold me half of what™s hidden in your manor\\n–ﬂ  \\n      Muttering darkly, Mr. Borgin disappeared into a back room. Harry waited for a minute in case he \\ncame back, then, quietly as he could, slipped out of\\n the cabinet, past the glass cases, and out of the shop door.  \\n      Clutching his broken glasses to his face,\\n Harry stared around. He had emerged into a dingy \\nalleyway that seemed to be made up entirely of\\n shops devoted to the Dark Arts. The one he™d \\njust left, Borgin and Burkes, looked like the largest, but opposite was a nasty window display of shrunken heads and, two doors down, a large cage was alive with gigantic black spiders. Two shabby-looking wizards were watching him from\\n the shadow of a doorway, muttering to each \\nother. Feeling jumpy, Harry set off, trying to hol\\nd his glasses on straight and hoping against hope he™d be able to find a way out of here.  \\n      An old wooden street sign hanging over a shop selling poisonous candles told him he was in Knockturn Alley. This didn™t help, as Harry had never heard of such a place. He supposed he hadn™t spoken clearly enough through his mouthful of ashes back in\\n the Weasleys™ fire. Trying to stay calm, he wondered what to do. \\n \\n      ﬁNot lost are you, my dear?ﬂ \\nsaid a voice in his ear, making him jump. \\n       An aged witch stood in front of him, holding a tray of what looked horribly like whole human \\nfingernails. She leered at him, show\\ning mossy teeth. Harry backed away. \\n       ﬁI™m fine, thanks,ﬂ he said. ﬁI™m just Šﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁHARRY! What d™yeh think yer doin™ down there?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      Harry™s heart leapt. So did the witch; a load of fingernails cascaded down over her feet and she \\ncursed as the massive form of Hagrid, the H\\nogwarts™ gamekeeper, came striding toward them, \\nbeetle-black eyes flashing \\nover his great bristling beard.  \\n      ﬁHagrid!ﬂ Harry croaked in relief. ﬁI was lost Š Floo powder Šﬂ  \\n      Hagrid seized Harry by the scruff of the neck and pulled him away fr\\nom the witch, knocking the tray right out of her hands. Her shrieks followed them all the way along the twisting alleyway out \\ninto bright sunlight. Harry saw a familiar, snow-white marble building in the distance Š \\n\\nGringotts Bank. Hagrid had steere\\nd him right into Diagon Alley. \\n \\n      ﬁYer a mess!ﬂ said Hagrid gruffly, brushing \\nsoot off Harry so forcefully he nearly knocked him into a barrel of dragon dung outside an apothecary. ﬁSkulkin™ around Knockturn Alley, I dunno dodgy place, Harry Š don™ want no one ter see yeh down there Šﬂ \\n       ﬁI realized that,ﬂ said Harry, ducking as Hagrid made to\\n brush him off again. ﬁI told you, I was \\nlost Š what were you doing down there, anyway?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁI was lookin™ fer a Flesh-Eatin™ \\nSlug Repellent,ﬂ growled Hagrid. ﬁThey™re ruinin™ the school \\ncabbages. Yer not on yer own?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁI™m staying with the Weasleys but we got\\n separated,ﬂ Harry explained. ﬁI™ve got to go and find \\nthem–ﬂ \\n \\n      They set off together down the street. \\n \\n      ﬁHow come yeh never wrote back ter me?ﬂ \\nsaid Hagrid as Harry jogged alongside him (he had to \\ntake three steps to every stride of Hagrid™s enormous boots). Harry explained all about Dobby and the Dursleys.  \\n      ﬁLousy Muggles,ﬂ growled Hagrid. ﬁIf I™d™ve known Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁHarry! Harry! Over here!ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry looked up and saw Hermione Granger st\\nanding at the top of the white flight of steps to Gringotts. She ran down to meet them, her bushy brown hair flying behind her. \\n \\n      ﬁWhat happened to your \\nglasses? Hello, Ha\\ngrid Š Oh, it™s wonderful to see you two again Š \\nAre you coming into Gringotts, Harry?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁAs soon as I™ve found the Weasleys,ﬂ said Harry. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁYeh won™t have long ter wait,ﬂ Hagrid said with a grin.  \\n      Harry and Hermione looked around: Sprint\\ning up the crowded street were Ron, Fred, George, Percy, and Mr. Weasley. \\n \\n      ﬁHarry,ﬂ Mr. Weasley panted. ﬁWe \\nhoped you™d only gone one grate too far–ﬂ He mopped his \\nglistening bald patch. ﬁMolly™s frantic Š she™s coming now Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWhere did you come out?ﬂ Ron asked. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁKnockturn Alley,ﬂ said Hagrid grimly. \\n \\n      ﬁExcellent!ﬂ said Fred and George together. \\n \\n      ﬁWe™ve never been a\\nllowed in,ﬂ said Ron enviously.  \\n      ﬁI should ruddy well think not,ﬂ growled Hagrid. Mrs. Weasley now came galloping into view, \\nher handbag swinging wildly in one hand, Ginny just clinging onto the other.        ﬁOh, Harry Š oh, my dear Š you could have been anywhere Šﬂ \\n \\n      Gasping for breath she pulled a large clothes brush out of her bag and began sweeping off the soot Hagrid hadn™t managed to be\\nat away. Mr. Weasley took Harry™s glasses, gave them a tap of his wand, and returned them, good as new. \\n \\n      ﬁWell, gotta be off,ﬂ said Hagrid, who \\nwas having his hand wrung by Mrs. Weasley (ﬁKnockturn \\nAlley! If you hadn™t found him, Ha\\ngrid!ﬂ). ﬁSee yer at Hogwarts!ﬂ And he strode away, head and shoulders taller than anyone else in the packed street.  \\n      ﬁGuess who I saw in Borgin and Burkes?ﬂ \\nHarry asked Ron and Hermione as they climbed the \\nGringotts steps. ﬁMalfoy and his father.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁDid Lucius Malfoy buy anything?ﬂ\\n said Mr. Weasley sharply behind them. \\n \\n      ﬁNo, he was selling Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁSo he™s worried,ﬂ said Mr. Weasley with\\n grim satisfaction. ﬁOh, I™d love to get Lucius Malfoy \\nfor something–ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁYou be careful, Arthur,ﬂ said Mrs. Weas\\nley sharply as they were bowed into the bank by a goblin at the door. ﬁThat family™s trouble. D\\non™t go biting off more than you can chew Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁSo you don™t think I™m a match for Lucius \\nMalfoy?ﬂ said Mr. Weasley indignantly, but he was \\ndistracted almost at once by the sight of Hermione\\n™s parents, who were standing nervously at the counter that ran all along the great marble hall, waiting for Hermione to introduce them. \\n \\n      ﬁBut you™re Muggles!ﬂ said Mr. Weasley delightedly. ﬁWe must have a drink! What™s that \\nyou™ve got there? Oh, you™re ch\\nanging Muggle money. Molly, look!ﬂ He pointed excitedly at the ten-pound notes in Mr. Granger™s hand.  \\n      ﬁMeet you back here,ﬂ Ron said to Hermi\\none as the Weasleys and Harry were led off to their \\nunderground vaults by another Gringotts goblin.  \\n      The vaults were reached by means of sma\\nll, goblin-driven carts that sped along miniature train \\ntracks through the bank™s underground tunnels. Harry enjoyed the breakneck journey down to the Weasleys™ vault, but felt dreadful, far worse \\nthan he had in Knockturn Alley, when it was opened. There was a very small pile of silver \\nSickles inside, and just one gold Galleon. Mrs. Weasley felt right into the corners before sweep\\ning the whole lot into her bag. Harry felt even worse when they reached his vault. He tried to block the contents from view as he hastily shoved \\nhandfuls of coins into a leather bag.  \\n      Back outside on the marble steps, they \\nall separated. Percy muttered vaguely about needing a \\nnew quill. Fred and George had spotted their friend from Hogwarts, Lee Jordan. Mrs. Weasley \\nand Ginny were going to a secondhand robe shop. Mr. Weasley was insisting on taking the \\nGrangers off to the Leaky Cauldron for a drink.        ﬁWe™ll all meet at Flourish and Blotts in \\nan hour to buy your schoolbooks,ﬂ said Mrs. Weasley, \\nsetting off with Ginny. ﬁAnd not one step down Knockturn Alley!ﬂ she shouted at the twins™ retreating backs.  \\n      Harry, Ron, and Hermione strolled off along the winding, cobbled street\\n. The bag of gold, silver, and bronze jangling cheerfully in Harry™s pocket was clamoring to be spent, so he bought three \\nlarge strawberry-and-peanut-butter ice creams, wh\\nich they slurped happily as they wandered up the alley, examining the fascinating shop windows.\\n Ron gazed longingly at a full set of Chudley Cannon robes in the windows of Quality Quidditc\\nh Supplies until Hermione dragged them off to \\nbuy ink and parchment next door. In Gambol a\\nnd Japes Wizarding Joke Shop, they met Fred, \\nGeorge, and Lee Jordan, who were stocking up on Dr. Filibuster™s Fabulous Wet-Start, No-Heat \\nFireworks, and in a tiny junk shop full of broken wands, lopsided brass scales, and old cloaks covered in potion stains they found Percy, deeply immersed in a small and deeply boring book \\n\\ncalled Prefects Who Gained Power.  \\n      ﬁA study of Hogwarts prefects and their later careers,ﬂ \\nRon read aloud off the back cover. ﬁThat \\nsounds fascinating\\n–ﬂ  \\n      ﬁGo away,ﬂ Percy snapped. \\n \\n      ﬁ™Course, he™s very ambitious, Percy, he™s got it all planned out– He wants to be Minister of Magic–ﬂ Ron told Harry and Hermione in an\\n undertone as they left Percy to it.        An hour later, they headed for Flourish and Blotts. They were by no means the only ones making \\ntheir way to the bookshop. As they approached it, they saw to their surprise a large crowd jostling outside the doors, trying to get in. The reason for this was proclaimed by a large banner \\nstretched across the upper windows:    GILDEROY LOCKHART  will be signing copies of his autobiography \\n   MAGICAL ME \\n\\n \\n  today 12:30P.M.to 4:30P.M. \\n         ﬁWe can actually meet him!ﬂ Hermione squealed. ﬁI mean, he™s written almost the whole \\nbooklist!ﬂ  \\n      The crowd seemed to be made up mostly\\n of witches around Mrs. Weasley™s age. A harassed-\\nlooking wizard stood at the door, saying, ﬁCalmly, please, ladies– Don™t push, there– mind the \\nbooks, now–ﬂ        Harry, Ron, and Hermione squeezed inside\\n. A long line wound right to the back of the shop, where Gilderoy Lockhart was signing hi\\ns books. They each grabbed a copy of \\nThe Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2 and sneaked up the line to where the \\nrest of the Weasleys were standing with Mr. and Mrs. Granger.        ﬁOh, there you are, good,ﬂ said Mrs. Weas\\nley. She sounded breathless and kept patting her hair. ﬁWe™ll be able to see him in a minute–ﬂ \\n \\n      Gilderoy Lockhart came slowly into view, \\nseated at a table surrounded by large pictures of his own face, all winking and flashing dazzlingly white\\n teeth at the crowd. The real Lockhart was \\nwearing robes of forget-me-not blue that exactly\\n matched his eyes; his pointed wizard™s hat was \\nset at a jaunty angle on his wavy hair.  \\n      A short, irritable-looking man was danci\\nng around taking photographs with a large black camera that emitted puffs of purple smoke with every blinding flash. \\n \\n      ﬁOut of the way, there,ﬂ he snarled at Ron, moving back to get a better shot. ﬁThis is for the Daily Prophet Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁBig deal,ﬂ said Ron, rubbing his foot where the photographer had stepped on it. \\n\\n \\n      Gilderoy Lockhart heard him. He looked \\nup. He saw Ron Š and then he saw Harry. He stared. Then he leapt to his feet and positively shouted, ﬁIt can™t be Harry Potter?ﬂ \\n \\n      The crowd parted, whispering excitedly; Lockhart dived forw\\nard, seized Harry™s arm, and pulled \\nhim to the front. The crowd burst into applause. Harry™s face burned as Lockhart shook his hand \\nfor the photographer, who was clicking away madly, wafting thick smoke over the Weasleys. \\n       ﬁNice big smile, Harry,ﬂ said Lockhart, through his own gleaming teeth. ﬁTogether, you and I are \\nworth the front page.ﬂ  \\n      When he finally let go of Harry™s hand, Harry \\ncould hardly feel his fingers. He tried to sidle back \\nover to the Weasleys, but Lockhart threw an arm around his shoulders and clamped him tightly \\nto his side.  \\n      ﬁLadies and gentlemen,ﬂ he said loudly, waving for quiet. ﬁWha\\nt an extraordinary moment this \\nis! The perfect moment for me to make a litt\\nle announcement I™ve been sitting on for some time! \\n \\n      ﬁWhen young Harry here stepped into Flouri\\nsh and Blotts today, he only wanted to buy my \\nautobiography Š which I shall be happy to present him now, free of charge Šﬂ The crowd \\napplauded again. ﬁHe had no idea,ﬂ Lockhart continued, giving Harry a little shake that made his \\nglasses slip to the end of his nose, ﬁthat he would shortly be getting much, much more than my \\nbook, Magical Me. He and his schoolmates will, in fact, \\nbe getting the real magical me. Yes, \\nladies and gentlemen, I have great pleasure and prid\\ne in announcing that this September, I will be taking up the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft \\nand Wizardry!ﬂ \\n      The crowd cheered and clapped and Harry found himself being presente\\nd with the entire works of Gilderoy Lockhart. Staggering slightly under their weight, he managed to make his way out of \\nthe limelight to the edge of the room, wher\\ne Ginny was standing next to her new cauldron.        ﬁYou have these,ﬂ Harry mumbled to her,\\n tipping the books into the cauldron. ﬁI™ll buy my own \\nŠﬂ  \\n      ﬁBet you loved that, didn™t you, Potter?ﬂ said a voice Harry had no trouble recognizing. He straightened up and found himself face-to-face \\nwith Draco Malfoy, who was wearing his usual \\nsneer.  \\n      ﬁFamous Harry Potter,ﬂ said Malfoy. ﬁCan™t even go into a bookshop without making the front \\npage.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁLeave him alone, he didn™t want all that!ﬂ\\n said Ginny. It was the first time she had spoken in \\nfront of Harry. She was glaring at Malfoy.  \\n      ﬁPotter, you™ve got yourself a girlfriend!ﬂ drawled Malfoy. Ginny went scarlet as Ron and Hermione fought their way over, both cl\\nutching stacks of Lockhart™s books.  \\n      ﬁOh, it™s you,ﬂ said Ron, looking at Malfoy as if he were something unpleasant on the sole of his \\nshoe. ﬁBet you™re surprised to see Harry here, eh?ﬂ  \\n      ﬁNot as surprised as I am to see you in\\n a shop, Weasley,ﬂ retort\\ned Malfoy. ﬁI suppose your parents will go hungry for a month to pay for all those.ﬂ \\n       Ron went as red as Ginny. He dropped his books into the cauldron, too, and started toward Malfoy, but Harry and Hermione gr\\nabbed the back of his jacket.        ﬁRon!ﬂ said Mr. Weasley, struggling over w\\nith Fred and George. ﬁWhat are you doing? It™s too \\ncrowded in here, let™s go outside.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁWell, well, well Š Arthur Weasley.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      It was Mr. Malfoy. He stood with his hand on Draco™s shoulder, sneering in just the same way. \\n \\n      ﬁLucius,ﬂ said Mr. Weasley, nodding coldly.  \\n      ﬁBusy time at the Ministry, I hear,ﬂ sa\\nid Mr. Malfoy. ﬁAll those raids– I hope they™re paying you overtime?ﬂ  \\n      He reached into Ginny™s cauldron and extr\\nacted, from amid the glossy Lockhart books, a very \\nold, very battered copy of A Beginner™s Guide to Transfiguration.  \\n      ﬁObviously not,ﬂ Mr. Malfoy said. ﬁDear me, wh\\nat™s the use of being a disgrace to the name of \\nwizard if they don™t even pay you well for it?ﬂ \\n      Mr. Weasley flushed da\\nrker than either Ron or Ginny.        ﬁWe have a very different idea of what\\n disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy,ﬂ he said.  \\n      ﬁClearly,ﬂ said Mr. Malfoy, his pale eyes straying to Mr. and Mrs. Granger, who were watching apprehensively. ﬁThe company you keep, Weas\\nley– and I thought your family could sink no \\nlower.ﬂ  \\n      There was a thud of metal as Ginny™s cauldro\\nn went flying; Mr. Weasley had thrown himself at \\nMr. Malfoy, knocking him backward into a bookshelf. Dozens of heavy spellbooks came \\nthundering down on all their heads; there was a yell of, ﬁGet him, Dad!ﬂ from Fred or George; \\nMrs. Weasley was shrieking, ﬁNo, Arthur, no!ﬂ;\\n the crowd stampeded backward, knocking more \\nshelves over; ﬁGentlemen, please Š please!ﬂ crie\\nd the assistant, and then, louder than all Š  \\n      ﬁBreak it up, there, gents, break it up Šﬂ \\n \\n      Hagrid was wading toward them through \\nthe sea of books. In an instant he had pulled Mr. Weasley and Mr. Malfoy apart. \\nMr. Weasley had a cut lip and Mr. Malfoy had been hit in the \\neye by an Encyclopedia of Toadstools\\n. He was still holding Ginny™s old Transfiguration book. He thrust it at her, his ey\\nes glittering with malice. \\n \\n      ﬁHere, girl Š take your book Š it™s the be\\nst your father can give you Šﬂ Pulling himself out of \\nHagrid™s grip he beckoned to Draco and swept from the shop. \\n \\n      ﬁYeh should™ve ignored him, Arthur,ﬂ said Hagrid, almost lif\\nting Mr. Weasley off his feet as he straightened his robes. ﬁRotten ter the core, the whole family, everyone knows that Š no \\nMalfoy™s worth listenin™ ter Š bad blood, that™s what it is Š come on now Š let™s get outta \\nhere.ﬂ  \\n      The assistant looked as though he wanted to stop them leaving, but he barely came up to \\nHagrid™s waist and seemed to think better of it. \\nThey hurried up the street, the Grangers shaking \\nwith fright and Mrs. Weasle\\ny beside herself with fury.  \\n      ﬁA fine example to set for your children– \\nbrawling in public– what Gilderoy Lockhart must™ve \\nthought Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁHe was pleased,ﬂ said Fred. ﬁDidn™t you hear him as we were leav\\ning? He was asking that \\nbloke from the \\nDaily Prophet if he™d be able to work the fight into his report Š said it was all \\npublicity Šﬂ \\n \\n      But it was a subdued group that headed back \\nto the fireside in the Leaky Cauldron, where Harry, the Weasleys, and all their shopping would be trav\\neling back to the Burrow using Floo powder. \\nThey said good-bye to the Grangers, who were leaving the pub for the Muggle street on the other side; Mr. Weasley started to ask them how bus stops worked, but stopped quickly at the look on \\nMrs. Weasley™s face. \\n       Harry took off his glasses and put them safely in his pocket before helping himself to Floo \\npowder. It definitely wasn™t his favorite way to travel.    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n CHAPTER FIVE \\n  The Whomping Willow \\n     The end of the summer vacation came too quick\\nly for Harry™s liking. He was looking forward to \\ngetting back to Hogwarts, but his month at the Bu\\nrrow had been the happiest of his life. It was \\ndifficult not to feel jealous of Ron when he thought of the Dursleys and the sort of welcome he \\ncould expect next time he turned up on Privet Drive. \\n \\n      On their last evening, Mrs. Weasley conj\\nured up a sumptuous dinner th\\nat included all of Harry™s favorite things, ending with a mouthwatering tr\\neacle pudding. Fred and George rounded off the evening with a display of Filibuster fireworks; they\\n filled the kitchen with red and blue stars that \\nbounced from ceiling to wall for at least half an hour. Then it was time for a last mug of hot \\nchocolate and bed.  \\n      It took a long while to get started next morning. They were up at dawn, but somehow they still \\nseemed to have a great deal to do. Mrs. Weasley dashed about in a bad mood looking for spare \\n\\nsocks and quills; people kept colliding on the stairs, \\nhalf-dressed with bits of toast in their hands; \\nand Mr. Weasley nearly broke his neck, tripping \\nover a stray chicken as he crossed the yard \\ncarrying Ginny™s trunk to the car.  \\n      Harry couldn™t see how eight people, six large trunks, two owls, and a rat were going to fit into one small Ford Anglia. He had reckoned, of c\\nourse, without the special features that Mr. \\nWeasley had added.        ﬁNot a word to Molly,ﬂ he whispered to Harry as he opened the  trunk and showed him how it \\nhad been magically expanded so \\nthat the luggage fitted easily. \\n       When at last they were all in the car, Mr\\ns. Weasley glanced into the back seat, where Harry, Ron, \\nFred, George, and Percy were all sitting comfortably side by side, and said, ﬁMuggles \\ndo know more than we give them credit \\nfor, don™t they?ﬂ She and Ginny got\\n into the front seat, which had been stretched so that it resembled a park be\\nnch. ﬁI mean, you™d never know it was this roomy \\nfrom the outside, would you?ﬂ \\n \\n      Mr. Weasley started up the engine and they tr\\nundled out of the yard, Harry turning back for a last look at the house. He barely had time to wonde\\nr when he™d see it again when they were back. \\nGeorge had forgotten his box of Filibuster fireworks. Five minutes after that, they skidded to a \\n\\nhalt in the yard so that Fred could run in \\nfor his broomstick. They had almost reached the \\nhighway when Ginny shrieked that she™d left her diary. By the time she had clambered back into \\nthe car, they were running very late, and tempers were running high. \\n \\n      Mr. Weasley glanced at \\nhis watch and then at his wife.  \\n      ﬁMolly, dear Šﬂ \\n       ﬁNo, Arthur ŠŒﬂ        ﬁNo one would see Š this little button here \\nis an Invisibility Booster I \\ninstalled Š that™d get us up in the air Š then we fly above the clouds. We™d\\n be there in ten minutes and no one would be \\nany the wiser Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁI said no, Arthur, not in broad daylight Šﬂ \\n \\n      They reached King™s Cross at a quarter to eleven. Mr. Weasley dashed across the road to get \\ntrolleys for their trunks and they all hurried into the station.  \\n      Harry had caught the Hogwarts Express the previous year. The tricky part was getting onto platform nine and three-quarters, which wasn™t\\n visible to the Muggle eye. What you had to do \\nwas walk through the solid barrier dividing platforms \\nnine and ten. It didn™t hurt, but it had to be done carefully so that none of the Muggles noticed you vanishing.  \\n      ﬁPercy first,ﬂ said Mrs. Weasley, looking \\nnervously at the clock overhead, which showed they had only five minutes to disappear casually through the barrier. \\n \\n      Percy strode briskly forward and vanished. Mr. Weasley went next; Fred and George followed. \\n \\n      ﬁI™ll take Ginny and you two come right af\\nter us,ﬂ Mrs. Weasley told Harry and Ron, grabbing Ginny™s hand and setting off. In the blink of an eye they were gone.  \\n      ﬁLet™s go together, we™ve only got a minute,ﬂ Ron said to Harry. \\n       Harry made sure that Hedwig™s cage was safely wedged on top of his trunk and wheeled his trolley around to face the barrier. He felt perfectly\\n confident; this wasn™t nearly as uncomfortable \\nas using Floo powder. Both of them bent low \\nover the handles of their trolleys and walked \\npurposefully toward the barrier, gathering speed. A few feet away fr\\nom it, they broke into a run \\nand Š        CRASH. \\n \\n      Both trolleys hit the barrier and bounced backward; Ron™s trunk fell off with a loud thump, \\nHarry was knocked off his feet, and Hedwig™s cage bounced onto the shiny floor, and she rolled away, shrieking indignantly; people all around them stared and a guard nearby yelled, ﬁWhat in blazes d™you think you™re doing?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁLost control of the trolley,ﬂ Harry gasped, clutching his ribs as he got up. Ron ran to pick up Hedwig, who was causing such a scene that there was a lot of muttering a\\nbout cruelty to animals \\nfrom the surrounding crowd. \\n \\n      ﬁWhy can™t we get \\nthrough?ﬂ Harry hissed to Ron. \\n \\n      ﬁI dunno Šﬂ       Ron looked wildly around. A dozen curious people were still watching them. \\n \\n      ﬁWe™re going to miss the train,ﬂ Ron wh\\nispered. ﬁI don™t understand why the gateway™s sealed itself Šﬂ \\n \\n      Harry looked up at the giant clock with a sickening feeling in th\\ne pit of his stomach. Ten \\nseconds– nine seconds–   \\n      He wheeled his trolley forward cautiously until it was right against the \\nbarrier and pushed with all his might. The metal remained solid. \\n \\n      Three seconds– two seconds– one second–  \\n \\n      ﬁIt™s gone,ﬂ said Ron, sounding stunned. ﬁThe train™s left. What if Mum and Dad can™t get back through to us? Have you got any Muggle money?ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry gave a hollow laughed. ﬁThe Dursle\\nys haven™t given me poc\\nket money for about six \\nyears.ﬂ  \\n      Ron pressed his ear to the cold barrier. \\n \\n      ﬁCan™t hear a thing,ﬂ he said tensely, ﬁWhat™re we going to\\n do? I don™t know how long it™ll take \\nMum and Dad to get back to us.ﬂ \\n \\n      They looked around. People were still watching them, mainly because of Hedwig™s continuing \\nscreeches.  \\n      ﬁI think we™d better go and wait by the car,ﬂ said Harry. ﬁW\\ne™re attracting too much atten Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁHarry!ﬂ said Ron, his eyes gleaming. ﬁThe car!ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWhat about it?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁWe can fly the car to Hogwarts!ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁBut I thought Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWe™re stuck, right? And we™ve got to get \\nto school, haven™t we? And \\neven underage wizards are allowed to use magic if it™s a real emergency, sec\\ntion nineteen or something of the Restriction of \\nThingy Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁBut your Mum and Dad–ﬂ said Harry, pushing \\nagainst the barrier again in the vain hope that it would give way. ﬁHow will they get home?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁThey don™t need the car!ﬂ said Ron impatiently. ﬁThey know\\n how to Apparate! You know, just vanish and reappear at home! They only bother \\nwith Floo powder and the \\ncar because we™re all underage and we™re not allowed to Apparate yet–ﬂ        Harry™s feeling of panic turned suddenly to excitement. \\n \\n      ﬁCan you fly it?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁNo, problem,ﬂ said Ron, wheeling his tr\\nolley around to face the exit. ﬁC™mon, let™s go. If we \\nhurry we™ll be able to follo\\nw the Hogwarts Express Šﬂ  \\n      And they marched off through the crowd of cu\\nrious Muggles, out of the station and back onto the side road where the old Ford Anglia was parked. \\n \\n      Ron unlocked the cavernous trunk with a series of taps from his wand. They heaved their \\nluggage back in, put Hedwig on the back seat, and got into the front.  \\n      ﬁCheck that no one™s watching,ﬂ said R\\non, starting the ignition with\\n another tap of his wand. Harry stuck his head out of the window: Traffic was rumbling along the main road ahead, but \\ntheir street was empty. \\n \\n      ﬁOkay,ﬂ he said. \\n \\n      Ron pressed a tiny silver button on the dashboard. The car around them vanished Š and so did \\nthey. Harry could feel the seat vi\\nbrating beneath him, hear the engi\\nne, feel his hands on his knees and his glasses on his nose, but for all he could see, he had become a pair of eyeballs, floating a \\nfew feet above the ground in a dingy street full of parked cars. \\n       ﬁLet™s go,ﬂ said Ron™s voice from his right.  \\n      And the ground and the dirty buildings on either side fell away, dropping out of sight as the car rose; in seconds, the whole of London lay, smoky and glittering, below them. \\n \\n      Then there was a popping noise and the car, Harry, and Ron reappeared.  \\n      ﬁUh-oh,ﬂ said Ron, jabbing at the Invisibility Booster. ﬁIt™s faulty Šﬂ \\n \\n      Both of them pummeled it. The \\ncar vanished. Then it flickered back again. \\n \\n      ﬁHold on!ﬂ Ron yelled, and he slammed his foot on the accelerator; they shot straight into the \\nlow, woolly clouds and everything turned dull and foggy.  \\n      ﬁNow what?ﬂ said Harry, blinking at the \\nsolid mass of cloud pressing in on them from all sides. \\n \\n      ﬁWe need to see the train to \\nknow what direction to go in,ﬂ said Ron.  \\n      ﬁDip back down again Š quickly Šﬂ \\n       They dropped back beneath the clouds and twisted around in their seats, squinting at the ground.        ﬁI can see it!ﬂ Harry yelled. ﬁRight ahead Š there!ﬂ  \\n      The Hogwarts Express was streaking along below them like a scarlet snake. \\n \\n      ﬁDue north,ﬂ said Ron, checking the compa\\nss on the dashboard. ﬁOkay, we™ll just have to check \\non it every half hour or so Š hold on Šﬂ  \\n      And they shot up through the clouds. A minut\\ne later, they burst out \\ninto a blaze of sunlight. \\n \\n      It was a different world. The wheels of the car skimmed the sea of fluffy cloud, the sky a bright, \\nendless blue under the blinding white sun.  \\n      ﬁAll we™ve got to worry about now are airplanes,ﬂ said Ron. \\n\\n \\n      They looked at each other and started to laugh; for a long time, they couldn™t stop. \\n \\n      It was as though they had been plunged into a fabulous dream. This, thought Harry, was surely \\nthe only way to travel Š past swirls and turrets of snowy cloud, in a car full of hot, bright sunlight, with a fat pack of toffees in the glove \\ncompartment, and the prospect of seeing Fred™s \\nand George™s jealous faces when they landed smoothly and spectacularly on the sweeping lawn \\nin front of Hogwarts castle.  \\n      They made regular checks on the train as they\\n flew farther and farther north, each dip beneath the clouds showing them a different view. London wa\\ns soon far behind them, replaced by neat green fields that gave way in turn to wide, purplish m\\noors, a great city alive with cars like multicolored \\nants, villages with tiny toy churches.  \\n      Several uneventful hours later, however, Harry had to admit that some of the fun was wearing \\noff. The toffees had made them extremely thirst\\ny and they had nothing to drink. He and Ron had pulled off their sweaters, but Harry™s T-shirt was s\\nticking to the back of his seat and his glasses kept sliding down to the end of his sweaty nose. He had stopped noticing the fantastic cloud shapes now and was thinking longingly of the train miles below, wher\\ne you could buy ice-cold pumpkin juice from a trolley pushed by a plump witch. \\nWhy hadn™t they been able to get onto platform nine and three-quarters? \\n \\n      ﬁCan™t be much further, can it?ﬂ croaked R\\non, hours later still, as the sun started to sink into their floor of cloud, staining it a deep pink. ﬁReady for another check on the train?ﬂ \\n \\n      It was still right below them, winding its \\nway past a snowcapped mounta\\nin. It was much darker \\nbeneath the canopy of clouds.  \\n      Ron put his foot on the accelerator and drove them upward again, but as he did so, the engine \\nbegan to whine.        Harry and Ron exchanged nervous glances.  \\n      ﬁIt™s probably just tired,ﬂ said Ron. ﬁIt™s never been this far before–ﬂ  \\n      And they both pretended not to notice the whining growing louder and louder as the sky became \\nsteadily darker. Stars were blossoming in the bl\\nackness. Harry pulled his sweater back on, trying to ignore the way the windshield wipers were now waving feebly, as though in protest. \\n \\n      ﬁNot far,ﬂ said Ron, more to the car than to Harry, ﬁnot far now,ﬂ and he patted the dashboard nervously.  \\n      When they flew back beneath the clouds a \\nlittle while later, they had to squint through the \\ndarkness for a landmark they knew. \\n \\n      ﬁThere!ﬂ Harry shouted, making Ron and \\nHedwig jump. ﬁStraight ahead!ﬂ \\n \\n      Silhouetted on the dark horizon, high on the cliff over the lake, stood the many turrets and towers \\nof Hogwarts castle.  \\n      But the car had begun to shudder and was losing speed. \\n \\n      ﬁCome on,ﬂ Ron said cajol\\ningly, giving the steering wheel a little shake, ﬁnearly there, come on \\nŠﬂ  \\n      The engine groaned. Narrow jets of steam were issuing fro\\nm under the hood. Harry found \\nhimself gripping the edges of his seat very\\n hard as they flew toward the lake.  \\n      The car gave a nasty wobble. Glancing out of his window, Harry saw the smooth, black, glassy \\nsurface of the water, a mile below. Ron™s knuc\\nkles were white on the steering wheel. The car wobbled again.  \\n      ﬁCome on,ﬂ Ron muttered. \\n\\n \\n      They were over the lake Š the castle was right ahead Š Ron put his foot down.  \\n      There was a loud clunk, a splutter, and the engine died completely.  \\n      ﬁUh-oh,ﬂ said Ron, into the silence. \\n \\n      The nose of the car dropped. They were falling, gathering speed, heading straight for the solid castle wall.  \\n      ﬁNoooooo!ﬂ Ron yelled, swinging the steering wheel around; they missed the dark stone wall by \\ninches as the car turned in a great arc, soaring over the dark greenhouses, then the vegetable patch, and then out over the black lawns, losing altitude all the time. \\n       Ron let go of the steering wheel comple\\ntely and pulled his wand out of his back pocket Š        ﬁSTOP! STOP!ﬂ he yelled, whacking the dashboard and the windshield, but they were still plummeting, the ground flying up toward them Š \\n \\n      ﬁWATCH OUT FOR THAT TREE!ﬂ Harry \\nbellowed, lunging for the steering wheel, but too \\nlate Š  \\n      CRUNCH. \\n \\n      With an earsplitting bang of metal on w\\nood, they hit the thick tree trunk and dropped to the ground with a heavy jolt. Steam was billowi\\nng from under the crumpled hood; Hedwig was \\nshrieking in terror; a golfball-size lump was throbbing on Harry™s head where he had hit the windshield; and to his right, Ron let out a low, despairing groan.  \\n      ﬁAre you okay?ﬂ Harry said urgently. \\n \\n      ﬁMy wand,ﬂ said Ron, in a shaky voice. ﬁLook at my wand Šﬂ \\n\\n \\n      It had snapped, almost in two; the tip\\n was dangling limply, held on by a few splinters. \\n \\n      Harry opened his mouth to say he was sure\\n they™d be able to mend \\nit up at the school, but he never even got started. At that very moment, someth\\ning hit his side of the car with the force of a charging bull, sending him lurching sideways into Ron, just as an equall\\ny heavy blow hit the roof.        ﬁWhat™s happen Š?ﬂ \\n \\n      Ron gasped, staring through the windshield, and Harry looked around just in time to see a branch \\nas thick as a python smash into it. The tree they\\n had hit was attacking them. Its trunk was bent almost double, and its gnarled boughs were pumme\\nling every inch of the car it could reach.  \\n      ﬁAaargh!ﬂ said Ron as another twisted limb punched a large \\ndent into his door; the windshield was now trembling under a hail of blows from kn\\nuckle-like twigs and a branch as thick as a battering ram was pounding furiously on the roof, which seemed to be caving in. \\n \\n      ﬁRun for it!ﬂ Ron shouted, throwing his full weight against his door, but next second he had been knocked backward into Harry™s lap by a vicious uppercut from another branch.  \\n      ﬁWe™re done for!ﬂ he moaned as the \\nceiling sagged, but suddenly the floor of the car was \\nvibrating Š the engine had restarted.  \\n      ﬁReverse!ﬂ Harry yelled, and the car shot backward; the tree was still trying to hit them; they \\ncould hear its roots creaking as it almost ripped itself up, lashing out\\n at them as they sped out of reach.        ﬁThat,ﬂ panted Ron, ﬁwas close. Well done, car Šﬂ        The car, however, had reached the end of its tether. With two sharp clunks, the doors flew open \\nand Harry felt his seat tip sideways: Next thing he knew he was sprawled on the damp ground. \\nLoud thuds told him that the car was ejecting th\\neir luggage from the trunk; Hedwig™s cage flew \\nthrough the air and burst open; she rose out of it with an angry screech and sped off toward the castle without a backward look. Then, dented, scratched, and steaming, the car rumbled off into \\nthe darkness, its rear lights blazing angrily.  \\n      ﬁCome back!ﬂ Ron yelled after it, \\nbrandishing his broken wand. ﬁDad™ll kill me!ﬂ \\n \\n      But the car disappeared from view\\n with one last snort from its exhaust.  \\n      ﬁCan you believe\\n our luck?ﬂ said R\\non miserably, bending down to pi\\nck up Scabbers. ﬁOf all the trees we could™ve hit, we had to get one that hits back.ﬂ \\n \\n      He glanced over his shoulder at the an\\ncient tree, which was still flailing its branches \\nthreateningly. \\n \\n      ﬁCome on,ﬂ said Harry wearil\\ny, ﬁwe™d better get up to the school–ﬂ  \\n      It wasn™t at all the triumphant arrival they had pictured. Sti\\nff, cold, and bruised, they seized the \\nends of their trunks and began dragging them up \\nthe grassy slope, toward the great oak front doors.  \\n      ﬁI think the feast™s already started,ﬂ said Ron, dropping his trunk at the foot of the front steps and crossing quietly to look through a brightly lit window. ﬁHey Š Harry Š come and look Š it™s \\n\\nthe Sorting!ﬂ  \\n      Harry hurried over and, together, he and Ron peered in at the Great Hall.  \\n      Innumerable candles were hovering in mida\\nir over four long, crowded tables, making the golden \\nplates and goblets sparkle. Overhead, the bewitched ceiling, which always mirrored the sky \\noutside, sparkled with stars.  \\n      Through the forest of pointed black Hogwar\\nts hats, Harry saw a long line of scared-looking first years filing into the Hall. Ginny was among them, \\neasily visible because of her vivid Weasley \\nhair. Meanwhile, Professor McGonagall, a bespectacled witch with her hair in a tight bun, was placing the famous Hogwarts Sorting Hat on a stool before the newcomers. \\n \\n      Every year, this aged old hat, patched, frayed, and dirty, sorted new students into the four Hogwarts houses (Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenc\\nlaw, and Slytherin). Harry well remembered \\nputting it on, exactly one year ago, and waiting, pe\\ntrified, for its decision as it muttered aloud in \\nhis ear. For a few horrible seconds he had feared that the hat was going to put him in Slytherin, \\nthe house that had turned out more\\n Dark witches and wizards than any other but he had ended up in Gryffindor, along with Ron, Hermione, and the \\nrest of the Weasleys. Last term, Harry and \\nRon had helped Gryffindor win the House Championship, beating Slytherin for the first time in \\nseven years.        A very small, mousy-haired boy had been \\ncalled forward to place the hat on his head. Harry™s eyes wandered past him to where Professor Du\\nmbledore, the headmaster, sat watching the \\nSorting from the staff table, his long silver beard and half-moon glasses shining brightly in the candlelight. Several seats along, Harry saw Gilderoy Lockhart, dressed in robes of aquamarine. \\n\\nAnd there at the end was Hagrid, huge and hairy, drinking deeply from his goblet. \\n \\n      ﬁHang on–ﬂ Harry muttered to Ron. ﬁThere™s an empty chair at th\\ne staff table– Where™s Snape?ﬂ  \\n      Professor Severus Snape was Harry™s least favorite teacher. Harry also happened to be Snape™s least favorite student. Cruel, sarcastic, and disliked by everybody except the students from his \\nown house (Slytherin), Snape taught Potions. \\n \\n      ﬁMaybe he™s ill!ﬂ said Ron hopefully. \\n \\n      ﬁMaybe he™s left\\n,ﬂ said Harry, ﬁbecause he missed out \\non the Defense Against Dark Arts job again!ﬂ  \\n      ﬁOr he might have been \\nsacked!ﬂ said Ron enthusiastically. ﬁI mean, everyone hates him Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁOr maybe,ﬂ said a very cold voice righ\\nt behind them, ﬁhe™s waiting to hear why you two didn™t \\narrive on the school train.ﬂ        Harry spun around. There, his black robes rippling in a cold breeze, stood Severus Snape. He was a thin man with sallow skin, a hooked nose, \\nand greasy, shoulder-length black hair, and at this moment, he was smiling in a way that told\\n Harry he and Ron were in very deep trouble. \\n \\n      ﬁFollow me,ﬂ said Snape. \\n\\n \\n      Not daring even to look at each other, Harry and Ron followed Snape up the steps into the vast, \\nechoing entrance hall, which was lit with flaming torches. A delic\\nious smell of food was wafting \\nfrom the Great Hall, but Snape led them away from the warmth and light, down a narrow stone \\n\\nstaircase that led into the dungeons.  \\n      ﬁIn!ﬂ he said, opening a door halfway down the cold passageway and pointing. \\n \\n      They entered Snape™s office, shivering. The shadowy walls were lined with shelves of large glass jars, in which floated all manner of\\n revolting things Harry didn™t re\\nally want to know the name of \\nat the moment. The fireplace was dark and empty.\\n Snape closed the door and turned to look at them. \\n \\n      ﬁSo,ﬂ he said softly, ﬁthe train isn™t good enough for the famous Harry Potter and his faithful \\nsidekick Weasley. Wanted to arrive with a \\nbang, did we, boys?ﬂ       ﬁNo, sir, it was the barrier at King™s Cross, it Šﬂ        ﬁSilence!ﬂ said Snape coldly. ﬁWhat have you done with the car?ﬂ Ron gulped. This wasn™t the first time Snape had given Harry the impression of \\nbeing able to read minds. But a moment later, \\nhe understood, as Snape unrolled today™s issue of the Evening Prophet. ﬁYou were seen,ﬂ he hissed, showing them the headline\\n: FLYING FORD ANGLIA MYSTIFIES MUGGLES. \\nHe began to read aloud: ﬁTwo Muggles in London, convinced they saw an old car flying over the Post Office tower– at noon in Norfolk, Mrs. Hetty Bayliss, while hanging out her washing– Mr. Angus Fleet, of Peebles, reported to police– Six or\\n seven Muggles in all. I believe your father works in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office?ﬂ he said, looking up at Ron and smiling still \\nmore nastily. ﬁDear, dear– his own son–ﬂ  \\n      Harry felt as though he™d just been walloped in the stomach by one of the mad tree™s larger \\nbranches. If anyone found out Mr. Weasley had bewitched the car– he hadn™t thought of that–  \\n \\n      ﬁI noticed, in my search of the park, that \\nconsiderable damage seems to\\n have been done to a very valuable Whomping Willow,ﬂ Snape went on. \\n \\n      ﬁThat tree did more damage\\n to us than we Šﬂ Ron blurted out. \\n \\n      ﬁSilence\\n!ﬂ snapped Snape again. ﬁMost unfortunately, \\nyou are not in my House and the decision to expel you does not rest with me\\n. I shall go and fetch the people who do have that happy power. You will wait here.ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry and Ron stared at each other, white-f\\naced. Harry didn™t feel hungry any more. He now felt \\nextremely sick. He tried not to look at a large,\\n slimy something suspended in green liquid on a \\nshelf behind Snape™s desk. If Snape had gone to fetch Professor McGonagall, head of Gryffindor \\nHouse, they were hardly any better off. She might be fairer than Snape, but she was still \\nextremely strict. \\n \\n      Ten minutes later, Snape returned, \\nand sure enough it was Professor McGonagall who accompanied him. Harry had seen Professor McG\\nonagall angry on several occasions, but either \\nhe had forgotten just how thin her mouth could g\\no, or he had never seen her this angry before. She raised her wand the moment she entered; \\nHarry and Ron both flinched, but she merely pointed it at the empty fireplace,\\n where flames suddenly erupted. \\n \\n      ﬁSit,ﬂ she said, and they both backed into chairs by the fire.  \\n      ﬁExplain,ﬂ she said, her glasses glinting ominously. \\n\\n \\n      Ron launched into the story, starting with the barrier at the station refusing to let them through. \\n \\n      ﬁŠ so we had no choice, Professor, we couldn™t get on the train.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁWhy didn™t you send \\nus a letter by owl? I believe \\nyou have an owl?ﬂ Professor McGonagall said \\ncoldly to Harry.       Harry gaped at her. Now she said it, that seemed the obvious thing to have done. \\n       ﬁI Š I didn™t think Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁThat,ﬂ said Professor McGonagall, ﬁis obvious.ﬂ \\n \\n      There was a knock on the office door and Snape, now looking happier than ever, opened it. There stood the headmaster, Professor Dumbledore. \\n \\n      Harry™s whole body went numb. Dumbledore \\nwas looking unusually grave. He stared down his very crooked nose at them, and Harry suddenly found himself wishing he and Ron were still \\nbeing beaten up by the Whomping Willow. \\n \\n      There was a long silence. Then Dumb\\nledore said, ﬁPlease explain why you did this.ﬂ  \\n      It would have been better if he had shouted. Harry hated the disappointment in his voice. For \\nsome reason, he was unable to l\\nook Dumbledore in the eyes, and s\\npoke instead to his knees. He told Dumbledore everything except that Mr. Weasley owned the bewitched car, making it sound \\n\\nas though he and Ron had happened to find a flying car parked outside the station. He knew Dumbledore would see through this at once, but \\nDumbledore asked no questions about the car. \\nWhen Harry had finished, he merely continue\\nd to peer at them through his spectacles.  \\n      ﬁWe™ll go and get our stuff,\\nﬂ said Ron in a hopeless sort of voice.  \\n      ﬁWhat are you talking about, We\\nasley?ﬂ barked Professor McGonagall.        ﬁWell, you™re expe\\nlling us, aren™t you?ﬂ said Ron. \\n       Harry looked quickly at Dumbledore. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁNot today, Mr. Weasley,ﬂ said Dumb\\nledore. ﬁBut I must impress upon both of you the \\nseriousness of what you have done. I will be writi\\nng to both your families \\ntonight. I must also warn you that if you do anything like this agai\\nn, I will have no choice but to expel you.ﬂ \\n \\n      Snape looked as though Christmas had been \\ncanceled. He cleared his throat and said, ﬁProfessor Dumbledore, these boys have flouted the Decree\\n for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry, \\ncaused serious damage to an old and valuable\\n tree Š surely acts of this nature Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁIt will be for Professor McGonagall to decide on these boys™ punishments, Severus,ﬂ said \\nDumbledore calmly. ﬁThey are in her House and are \\ntherefore her responsibility.ﬂ He turned to Professor McGonagall. ﬁI must go back to the feas\\nt, Minerva, I™ve got to give out a few notices. Come, Severus, there™s a delicious-looking \\ncustard tart I want to sample Šﬂ \\n \\n      Snape shot a look of pure venom at Harry an\\nd Ron as he allowed himself to be swept out of his \\noffice, leaving them alone with Professor McGona\\ngall, who was still eyeing them like a wrathful \\neagle.       ﬁYou™d better get along to the hospital wing, Weasle\\ny, you™re bleeding.ﬂ        ﬁNot much,ﬂ said Ron, hastily \\nwiping the cut over his eye with his sleeve.  \\n      ﬁProfessor, I wanted to watch my sister being Sorted Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁThe Sorting Ceremony is over,ﬂ said Professor McGonagall. ﬁYour sister is also in Gryffindor.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁOh, good,ﬂ said Ron. \\n \\n      ﬁAnd speaking of Gryffindor Šﬂ Professor McGonagall said sharply, but Harry cut in: ﬁProfessor, when we took the car, term hadn™t started, so Š so Gryffindor shouldn™t really have points taken from it Š should it?ﬂ he\\n finished, watching her anxiously.  \\n      Professor McGonagall gave him a pierci\\nng look, but he was sure she had almost smiled. Her \\nmouth looked less thin, anyway.  \\n      ﬁI will not take any points from Gryffindor,ﬂ she said, and Ha\\nrry™s heart lightened considerably. ﬁBut you will both get a detention.ﬂ It was better\\n than Harry had expected. As for Dumbledore™s \\nwriting to the Dursleys, that was nothing. Harry knew perfectly well they™d just be disappointed that the Whomping Willow hadn™t squashed him flat. \\n \\n      Professor McGonagall raised her wand again and pointed it at Snape™s desk. A large plate of sandwiches, two silver goblets, and a jug of iced pumpki\\nn juice appeared with a pop.  \\n      ﬁYou will eat in here and then go straight up to your dormitory,ﬂ \\nshe said. ﬁI must also return to \\nthe feast.ﬂ  \\n      When the door had closed behi\\nnd her, Ron let out a long, low whistle.  \\n      ﬁI thought we™d had it,ﬂ he said, grabbing a sandwich.  \\n      ﬁSo did I,ﬂ said Harry, taking one, too. \\n \\n      ﬁCan you believe our luck, though?ﬂ said Ron thickly through \\na mouthful of chicken and ham. \\nﬁFred and George must™ve flown that car \\nfive or six times and no Muggle ever saw \\nthem\\n.ﬂ He swallowed and took another huge bite. ﬁWhy couldn™t we get through the barrier?ﬂ  \\n      Harry shrugged. ﬁWe™ll have to watch our st\\nep from now on, though,ﬂ he\\n said, taking a grateful swig of pumpkin juice. ﬁWish we\\n could™ve gone up to the feast–ﬂ  \\n      ﬁShe didn™t want us showing off,ﬂ said R\\non sagely. ﬁDoesn™t want people to think it™s clever, \\narriving by flying car.ﬂ  \\n      When they had eaten as many sandwiches as th\\ney could (the plate kept refilling itself) they rose \\nand left the office, treading the familiar path \\nto Gryffindor Tower. The castle was quiet; it \\nseemed that the feast was over. They walked past\\n muttering portraits and cr\\neaking suits of armor, \\nand climbed narrow flights of stone\\n stairs, until at last they reached the passage where the secret \\nentrance to Gryffindor Tower was hidden, behind an oil painting of a very fat woman in a pink \\nsilk dress.  \\n      ﬁPassword?ﬂ she said as they approached. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁEr Šﬂ said Harry. \\n \\n      They didn™t know the new year™s password, not having met a Gryffindor prefect yet, but help \\ncame almost immediately; they heard hurrying feet behind them and turned to see Hermione \\n\\ndashing toward them. \\n \\n      ﬁThere you are! Where have you \\nbeen? The most \\nridiculous rumors Š someone said you™d been \\nexpelled for crashing a flying car!ﬂ  \\n      ﬁWell, we haven™t been expelled,ﬂ Harry assured her. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁYou™re not telling me you \\ndid fly here?ﬂ said Hermione, sounding \\nalmost as severe as Professor \\nMcGonagall.  \\n      ﬁSkip the lecture,ﬂ said Ron impatiently, ﬁand tell us the new password.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁIt™s ‚wattlebird,™ﬂ said Hermione impatiently, ﬁbut that™s not the point Šﬂ \\n \\n      Her words were cut short, however, as the portrait of the fat lady swung open and there was a sudden storm of clapping. It looked as though the whole of Gryffindor House was still awake, packed into the circular comm\\non room, standing on the lopsided tables and squashy armchairs, \\nwaiting for them to arrive. Arms reached through \\nthe portrait hole to pull \\nHarry and Ron inside, leaving Hermione to scramble in after them. \\n \\n      ﬁBrilliant!ﬂ yelled Lee Jordan. ﬁInspired! What an entrance! Flying a car right into the \\nWhomping Willow, people™ll be talk\\ning about that one for years Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁGood for you,ﬂ said a fifth year Harry had never spoken to; someone was patting him on the \\nback as though he™d just won a marathon; Fred \\nand George pushed their way to the front of the crowd and said together, ﬁWhy coul\\ndn™t we™ve come in the car, eh?ﬂ \\n \\n      Ron was scarlet in the face, grinning em\\nbarrassedly, but Harry could see one person who didn™t \\nlook happy at all. Percy was visible over the heads of some excited \\nfirst years, and he seemed to \\nbe trying to get near enough to start telling them off. Harry nudged Ron in the ribs and nodded in \\nPercy™s direction. Ron got the point at once.  \\n      ﬁGot to get upstairs Š bit tired,ﬂ he said, and the two of them started pushing their way toward \\nthe door on the other side of the room, which led to a spiral staircase and the dormitories. \\n       ﬁ‚Night,ﬂ Harry called back to Hermione, who was wearing a scowl just like Percy™s. \\n \\n      They managed to get to the other side \\nof the common room, still having their backs slapped, and \\ngained the peace of the staircase. They hurried up \\nit, right to the top, and at last reached the door of their old dormitory, which now had a sign on\\n it saying SECOND YEARS. They entered the \\nfamiliar, circular room, with its five four-\\nposters hung with red velvet and its high, narrow \\nwindows. Their trunks had been brought up for them and stood at the ends of their beds. \\n \\n      Ron grinned guiltily at Harry. \\n \\n      ﬁI know I shouldn™t™ve enjoyed that or anything, but–ﬂ  \\n      The dormitory door flew open and in came the other second year Gryffindor boys, Seamus \\nFinnigan, Dean Thomas, and Neville Longbottom. \\n \\n      ﬁUnbelievable!ﬂ beamed Seamus. \\n \\n      ﬁCool,ﬂ said Dean. \\n \\n      ﬁAmazing,ﬂ said Neville, awestruck. \\n\\n \\n      Harry couldn™t help it. He grinned, too. \\n \\n          \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n CHAPTER SIX \\n  Gilderoy Lockhart \\n    The next day, however, Harry barely grinned once. Things started to go downhill from breakfast \\nin the Great Hall. The four long house tables were laden with tureens of porridge, plates of kippers, mountains of toast, and dishes of eggs and bacon, beneath the enchanted ceiling (today, \\n\\na dull, cloudy gray). Harry and Ron sat down at the Gryffindor table next to Hermione, who had \\nher copy of Voyages with Vampires propped open against a milk jug. \\nThere was a slight stiffness in the way she said ﬁMorning,ﬂ which told Harry that she was still disapproving of the way they had arrived. Neville Longbottom, on the other \\nhand, greeted them cheerfully. Neville was a \\nround-faced and accident-prone boy with the wors\\nt memory of anyone Harry had ever met. \\n \\n      ﬁMail™s due any minute Š I thin\\nk Gran™s sending a few things I forgot.ﬂ  \\n      Harry had only just started his porridge when, sure enough, there was a rushing sound overhead and a hundred or so owls streamed\\n in, circling the hall and dropping letters and packages into the chattering crowd. A big, lumpy package bounced \\noff Neville™s head and, a second later, something large and gray fell into Hermione™s \\njug, spraying them all with milk and feathers. \\n \\n      ﬁErrol!ﬂ said Ron, pulling the bedraggled \\nowl out by the feet. Errol slumped, Unconscious, onto \\nthe table, his legs in the air and \\na damp red envelope in his beak.  \\n      ﬁOh, no Šﬂ Ron gasped. \\n       ﬁIt™s all right, he™s still alive,ﬂ said Hermione, prodding Errol \\ngently with the tip of her finger.        ﬁIt™s not that Š it™s that.ﬂ  \\n      Ron was pointing at the red envelope. It looked quite ordinary to Harry, but Ron and Neville \\nwere both looking at it as though they expected it to explode.  \\n      ﬁWhat™s the matter?ﬂ said Harry. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁShe™s Š she™s sent me a Howler,ﬂ said Ron faintly. \\n \\n      ﬁYou™d better open it, Ron,ﬂ said Neville in\\n a timid whisper. ﬁIt™ll be worse if you don™t. My \\ngran sent me one once, and I ignored it andﬂ Š he gulped Šﬁit was horrible.ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry looked from their pe\\ntrified faces to the red envelope. \\n \\n      ﬁWhat™s a Howler?ﬂ he said. \\n\\n \\n      But Ron™s whole attention was fixed on the letter, which had begun to smoke at the corners. \\n       ﬁOpen it,ﬂ Neville urged. ﬁIt™ll all be over in a few minutes Šﬂ \\n       Ron stretched out a shaking hand, eased the envelope from Errol™s beak, and slit it open. Neville stuffed his fingers in his ears. A split second later, Harry knew why. He thought for a moment it \\nhad exploded; a roar of sound filled the huge hall, shaking dust from the ceiling. \\n \\n      ﬁŠSTEALING THE CAR, I WOUL\\nDN™T HAVE BEEN SURPRISED IF THEY™D \\nEXPELLED YOU, YOU WAIT TILL I GET \\nHOLD OF YOU, I DON™T SUPPOSE YOU \\nSTOPPED TO THINK WHAT YOUR FATHER\\n AND I WENT THROUGH WHEN WE SAW \\nIT WAS GONE Šﬂ \\n \\n      Mrs. Weasleys yells, a hundred times louder than usual, made the plates and spoons rattle on the \\ntable, and echoed deafeningly off the stone walls. People throughout the hall were swiveling around to see who had received the Howler, and Ron sank so low in his chair that only his \\ncrimson forehead could be seen. \\n \\n      ﬁŠLETTER FROM DUMBLEDORE LAST\\n NIGHT, I THOUGHT YOUR FATHER WOULD DIE OF SHAME, WE DIDN™\\nT BRING YOU UP TO BEH\\nAVE LIKE THIS, YOU AND HARRY COULD BOTH HAVE DIED Šﬂ \\n \\n      Harry had been wondering when his name \\nwas going to crop up. He tried very hard to look as \\nthough he couldn™t hear the voice that was making his eardrums throb. \\n \\n      ﬁŠABSOLUTELY DISGUSTED Š YOUR\\n FATHER™S FACING AN INQUIRY AT WORK, \\nIT™S ENTIRELY YOUR FAULT AND IF YOU PUT ANOTHER TOE OUT OF LINE WE™LL BRING YOU STRAIGHT BACK HOME.ﬂ \\n \\n      A ringing silence fell. The red envelope, which had dropped from Ron™s hand, burst into flames \\nand curled into ashes. Harry and Ron sat stunn\\ned, as though a tidal wave had just passed over them. A few people laughed and, graduall\\ny, a babble of talk broke out again.  \\n      Hermione closed \\nVoyages with Vampires\\n and looked down at the top of Ron™s head.  \\n      ﬁWell, I don™t know what you expected, Ron, but you Šﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁDon™t tell me I deserved it,ﬂ snapped Ron. \\n\\n \\n      Harry pushed his porridge away. His insides were burning with guilt. Mr. Weasley was facing an \\ninquiry at work. After all Mr. and Mrs. \\nWeasley had done for him over the summer–  \\n \\n      But he had no time to dwell on this; Professor McGonagall was moving along the Gryffindor \\ntable, handing out course schedules. Harry took his and saw that they had double Herbology with \\nthe Hufflepuffs first. \\n \\n      Harry, Ron, and Hermione left the castle to\\ngether, crossed the vegetable patch, and made for the \\ngreenhouses, where the magical plants were kept\\n. At least the Howler had done one good thing: Hermione seemed to think they had now been punished enough and was being perfectly friendly \\nagain.  \\n      As they neared the greenhouses they saw the rest of the class standing outside, waiting for Professor Sprout. Harry, Ron, and Hermione had \\nonly just joined them when she came striding \\ninto view across the lawn, accomp\\nanied by Gilderoy Lockhart. Professor Sprout™s arms were full \\nof bandages, and with another twinge of gu\\nilt, Harry spotted the Whomping Willow in the \\ndistance, several of its branches now in slings.  \\n      Professor Sprout was a squat little witch who wore a patched hat over her flyaway hair; there was usually a large amount of \\nearth on her clothes and her fingernails would have made Aunt Petunia faint. Gilderoy Lockhart, however, was \\nimmaculate in sweeping robes of turquoise, his golden hair shining under a perfectly pos\\nitioned turquoise hat with gold trimming. \\n \\n      ﬁOh, hello there!ﬂ he called, beaming ar\\nound at the assembled students. ﬁJust been showing Professor Sprout the right way to doctor a Whomping Willow! But I don™t want you running \\n\\naway with the idea that I™m better at Herbology than\\n she is! I just happen to have met several of \\nthese exotic plants on my travels–ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁGreenhouse three today, chaps!ﬂ said Professor Sprout, who was looking \\ndistinctly disgruntled, not at all her usual cheerful self.  \\n      There was a murmur of interest. They \\nhad only ever worked in greenhouse one before Š greenhouse three housed far more in\\nteresting and dangerous plants. Professor Sprout took a large key from her belt and unlocked the door. Harry\\n caught a whiff of damp earth and fertilizer \\nmingling with the heavy perfume \\nof some giant, umbrella-siz\\ned flowers dangling from the ceiling. He was about to follow Ron and Hermio\\nne inside when Lockhart™s hand shot out.  \\n      ﬁHarry! I™ve been wanting a word Š you don™t mind if he™s a couple of minutes late, do you, \\nProfessor Sprout?ﬂ \\n \\n      Judging by Professor Sprout™s scowl, she did mind, but Lockhart said, ﬁThat™s the ticket,ﬂ and \\nclosed the greenhouse door in her face.  \\n      ﬁHarry,ﬂ said Lockhart, his large white teeth gleaming in \\nthe sunlight as he shook his head. ﬁHarry, Harry, Harry.ﬂ  \\n      Completely nonplussed, Harry said nothing. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁWhen I heard Š well, of course, it wa\\ns all my fault. Could have kicked myself.ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry had no idea what he was talking about. He was about to say so when Lockhart went on, ﬁDon™t know when I™ve been more shocked. Flying a \\ncar to Hogwarts! Well, \\nof course, I knew at once why you™d done it. Stood out a mile. Harry, Harry, \\nHarry.ﬂ  \\n      It was remarkable how he could show every one of those brilliant teeth even when he wasn™t \\ntalking.        ﬁGave you a taste for publicity, didn™t I?ﬂ said Lockhart. ﬁGave you the \\nbug. You got onto the front page of the paper with me \\nand you couldn™t wait to do it again.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁOh, no, Professor, see Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁHarry, Harry, Harry,ﬂ said Lockhart, reaching out and grasping his shoulder. ﬁI \\nunderstand. Natural to want a bit more once you™ve had that\\n first taste Š and I blame myself for giving you \\nthat, because it was bound to go to your head Š but see here, young man, you can™t start \\nflying \\ncars to try and get yourself noticed. Just calm dow\\nn, all right? Plenty of time for all that when \\nyou™re older. Yes, yes, I know what you™re thinking! ‚It™s all right for him, he™s an internationally famous wizard al\\nready!™ But when I was twelve, I was just as much of a nobody \\nas you are now. In fact, I™d say I was even more\\n of a nobody! I mean, a few people have heard of \\nyou, haven™t they? All that busin\\ness with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named!ﬂ He glanced at the \\nlightning scar on Harry™s forehead. ﬁI know, I know Š it™s not quite as good as winning Witch Weekly™s Most Charming Smile Award five times in a row, as I have Š but it™s a \\nstart, Harry, it™s a start.ﬂ  \\n      He gave Harry a hearty wink and strode off. Harry stood stunned for a few seconds, then, remembering he was supposed to be in the gr\\neenhouse, he opened the door and slid inside. \\n \\n      Professor Sprout was standing behind a trestle bench in the center of the greenhouse. About twenty pairs of different-colored ear muffs were lying on the bench. When Harry had taken his \\nplace between Ron and Hermione, she said, ﬁWe™ll\\n be repotting Mandrakes today. Now, who can \\ntell me the properties of the Mandrake?ﬂ \\n \\n      To nobody™s surprise, Hermione™s hand was first into the air. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁMandrake, or Mandragora, is a powerful restorative,ﬂ said Hermione, sounding as usual as \\nthough she had swallowed the textbook. ﬁIt is used to return people who have been transfigured or cursed to their original state.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁExcellent. Ten points to Gryffindor,ﬂ said Professor Sprout. ﬁThe Ma\\nndrake forms an essential part of most antidotes. It is also, how\\never, dangerous. Who can tell me why?ﬂ \\n \\n      Hermione™s hand narrowly misse\\nd Harry™s glasses as it shot up again.  \\n      ﬁThe cry of the Mandrake is fatal to anyone who hears it,ﬂ she said promptly. \\n \\n      ﬁPrecisely. Take another ten points,ﬂ said Professor Sprout. ﬁNow, the Mandrakes we have here \\nare still very young.ﬂ  \\n      She pointed to a row of deep trays as she spoke, and everyone shuffled forward for a better look. A hundred or so tufty little plants, purplish green in color, were growing there in rows. They looked quite unremarkable to Harr\\ny, who didn™t have the slightest idea what Hermione meant by \\nthe ﬁcryﬂ of the Mandrake. \\n       ﬁEveryone take a pair of earmuffs,ﬂ said Professor Sprout. \\n\\n \\n      There was a scramble as everyone tried \\nto seize a pair that wasn™t pink and fluffy.  \\n      ﬁWhen I tell you to put them on, make sure your ears are \\ncompletely\\n covered,ﬂ said Professor Sprout. ﬁWhen it is safe to remove them, I will give you the thumbs-up. Right Š earmuffs \\non.ﬂ  \\n      Harry snapped the earmuffs over his ears. Th\\ney shut out sound completely. Professor Sprout put \\nthe pink, fluffy pair over her own ears, rolled up the sleeves of her robes, grasped one of the tufty plants firmly, and pulled hard. \\n \\n      Harry let out a gasp of surprise that no one could hear. \\n \\n      Instead of roots, a small, muddy, and ex\\ntremely ugly baby popped out of the earth. The leaves were growing right out of his head. He had pale\\n green, mottled skin, and was clearly bawling at \\nthe top of his lungs.  \\n      Professor Sprout took a large plant pot from under the table and plunge\\nd the Mandrake into it, burying him in dark, damp compost until only the tufted leaves were visible. Professor Sprout \\n\\ndusted off her hands, gave them all the thumbs-up, and removed her own earmuffs. \\n \\n      ﬁAs our Mandrakes are only seedlings, thei\\nr cries won™t kill yet,ﬂ sh\\ne said calmly as though \\nshe™d just done nothing more exciting than water a begonia. ﬁHowever, they will knock you out for several hours, and as I™m sure none of you wa\\nnt to miss your first day back, make sure your \\nearmuffs are securely in place while you work. I w\\nill attract your attentio\\nn when it is time to \\npack up.  \\n      ﬁFour to a tray Š there is a large supply of pots here Š compost in the sacks over there Š and be careful of the Venemous\\n Tentacula, it™s teething.ﬂ  \\n      She gave a sharp slap to a spiky, dark red plant as she spoke, making it draw in the long feelers \\nthat had been inching sneakily over her shoulder.  \\n      Harry, Ron, and Hermione were joined at th\\neir tray by a curly-haired Hufflepuff boy Harry knew by sight but had never spoken to.  \\n      ﬁJustin Finch-Fletchley,ﬂ he said bright\\nly, shaking Harry by the hand. ﬁKnow who you are, of course, the famous Harry Potter– And you™re He\\nrmione Granger Š always top in everythingﬂ \\n(Hermione beamed as she had her hand shaken \\ntoo) ﬁŠ and Ron Weas\\nley. Wasn™t that your \\nflying car?ﬂ  \\n      Ron didn™t smile. The Howler was obviously still on his mind. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁThat Lockhart™s something, isn™t he?ﬂ said \\nJustin happily as they began filling their plant pots \\nwith dragon dung compost. ﬁAwfully brave chap. Ha\\nve you read his books? I™d \\nhave died of fear if Id been cornered in a telephone booth by a werewolf, but he stayed cool and Š zap Š just fantastic.        ﬁMy name was down for Eton, you know. I can™t\\n tell you how glad I am I came here instead. Of \\ncourse, Mother was slightly disappointed, but since I made her \\nread Lockhart™s books I think she™s begun to see how useful it™ll be to have a fully trained wizard in the family–ﬂ \\n \\n      After that they didn™t have much chance to \\ntalk. Their earmuffs were back on and they needed to concentrate on the Mandrakes. Professor Sprout had made it look extremely easy, but it wasn™t. \\nThe Mandrakes didn™t like coming out of the earth, but didn™t seem to want to go back into it \\n\\neither. They squirmed, kicked, flai\\nled their sharp little fists, and \\ngnashed their teeth; Harry spent \\nten whole minutes trying to squash a particularly fat one into a pot.  \\n      By the end of the class, Harry, like everyone else, was sweaty, achi\\nng, and covered in earth. Everyone traipsed back to the castle for a quick wash and then the Gryffindors hurried off to \\nTransfiguration.  \\n      Professor McGonagall™s classes were always hard work, but today was especially difficult. \\nEverything Harry had learned last year seemed \\nto have leaked out of his head during the \\nsummer. He was supposed to be turning a beetle in\\nto a button, but all he managed to do was give \\nhis beetle a lot of exercise as it scuttled over the desktop avoiding his wand.  \\n      Ron was having far worse problems. \\nHe had patched up his wand with some borrowed \\nSpellotape, but it seemed to be damaged beyond \\nrepair. It kept crackling and sparking at odd moments, and every time Ron trie\\nd to transfigure his beetle it engulfed him in thick gray smoke \\nthat smelled of rotten eggs. Unable to see wh\\nat he was doing, Ron accidentally squashed his \\nbeetle with his elbow and had to ask for a new one. Professor McGonagall wasn™t pleased.  \\n      Harry was relieved to hear the lunch bell. His brain felt like a wrung sponge. Everyone filed out of the classroom except him and Ron, who wa\\ns whacking his wand furiously on the desk.  \\n      ﬁStupid Š useless Š thing Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWrite home for another one,ﬂ Harry sugge\\nsted as the wand let off a volley of bangs like a firecracker.  \\n      ﬁOh, yeah, and get another Howler back,ﬂ said Ron, stuffing the now hissing wand into his bag.   ﬁ‚It™s your own fault your wand got snapped Š ™ﬂ \\n \\n      They went down to lunch, where Ron™s mood was not improved by Hermione™s showing them \\nthe handful of perfect coat buttons she had produced in Transfiguration. \\n \\n      ﬁWhat™ve we got this afternoon\\n?ﬂ said Harry, hastily changing the subject. \\n       ﬁDefense Against the Dark\\n Arts,ﬂ said Hermione at once. \\n       ﬁWhy,ﬂ demanded Ron, seizing her schedule, ﬁhave you \\noutlined all Lockhart™s lessons in little \\nhearts?ﬂ \\n \\n      Hermione snatched the schedule back, blushing furiously. \\n\\n \\n      They finished lunch and went outside into the overcast courtyard. Hermione sat down on a stone \\nstep and buried her nose in Voyages with Vampires\\n again. Harry and Ron stood talking about Quidditch for several minutes before Harry beca\\nme aware that he was being closely watched. \\nLooking up, he saw the very small, mousy-haired \\nboy he™d seen trying on the Sorting Hat last night staring at Harry as though transfixed. He was clutching what looked like an ordinary Muggle camera, and the moment Harry l\\nooked at him, he went bright red. \\n \\n      ﬁAll right, Harry? I™m \\nŠ I™m Colin Creevey,ﬂ he said br\\neathlessly, taking a tentative step \\nforward. ﬁI™m in Gryffindor, too. D™you think Š would it be all right if Š can I have a picture?ﬂ he said, raising the camera hopefully. \\n \\n      ﬁA picture?ﬂ Harry repeated blankly. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁSo I can prove I™ve met you,ﬂ said Colin \\nCreevey eagerly, edging further forward. ﬁI know all about you. Everyone™s told me. About how you surv\\nived when You-Know-Who tried to kill you \\nand how he disappeared and everything and how you™ve still got a lightning scar on your foreheadﬂ (his eyes raked Harry™s hairline) ﬁand a boy in my dormito\\nry said if I develop the film \\nin the right potion, the pictures™ll move.ﬂ Colin drew a great shuddering breath of excitement and \\nsaid, ﬁIt™s amazing here, isn™t it? I never knew all the odd stuff I could do was magic till I got the \\nletter from Hogwarts. My dad™s a milkman, he c\\nouldn™t believe it either. So I™m taking loads of \\npictures to send home to him. And it™d be re\\nally good if I had one of youﬂ Š he looked imploringly at Harry Š ﬁmaybe \\nyour friend could take it and I could stand next to you? And \\nthen, could you sign it?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁSigned photos? You™re giving out signed photos, Potter?ﬂ \\n \\n      Loud and scathing, Draco Malfoy™s voice \\nechoed around the courtyard. He had stopped right behind Colin, flanked, as he always was at Hogwarts, by his large and thuggish cronies, Crabbe and Goyle.  \\n      ﬁEveryone line up!ﬂ Malfoy roared to the crowd. ﬁHarry Potter™s giving out signed photos!ﬂ  \\n      ﬁNo, I™m not,ﬂ said Harry angrily, his fists clenching. ﬁShut up, Malfoy.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁYou™re just jealous,ﬂ piped up Colin, whose entire body was a\\nbout as thick as Crabbe™s neck.  \\n      ﬁJealous?ﬂ said Malfoy, who didn™t need to shout a\\nnymore: half the cour\\ntyard was listening in. ﬁOf what? I don™t want a foul scar\\n right across my head, thanks. \\nI don™t think getting your head cut open makes you that special, myself.ﬂ \\n      Crabbe and Goyle were sniggering stupidly.  \\n      ﬁEat slugs, Malfoy,ﬂ said Ron angrily. Crabbe stopped laughing and started rubbing his knuckles in a menacing way. \\n \\n      ﬁBe careful, Weasley,ﬂ sneered Malfoy. ﬁY\\nou don™t want to start any trouble or your Mommy™ll have to come and take you away from sc\\nhool.ﬂ He put on a shrill, piercing voice. ﬁ‚If you put another toe out of line™Šﬂ  \\n      A knot of Slytherin fifth-years nearby laughed loudly at this. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁWeasley would like a signed photo, Potter,\\nﬂ smirked Malfoy. ﬁIt™d be worth more than his \\nfamily™s whole house Šﬂ \\n \\n      Ron whipped out his Spellotaped wand, but Hermione shut \\nVoyages with Vampires\\n with a snap \\nand whispered, ﬁLook out!ﬂ  \\n      ﬁWhat™s all this, what™s\\n all this?ﬂ Gilderoy Lockhart was striding toward them, his turquoise \\nrobes swirling behind him. ﬁW\\nho™s giving out signed photos?ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry started to speak but he was cut short as Lockhart flung an arm around his shoulders and \\nthundered jovially, ﬁShouldn™t have asked! We meet again, Harry!ﬂ \\n \\n      Pinned to Lockhart™s side and burning \\nwith humiliation, Harry saw Malfoy slide smirking back \\ninto the crowd. \\n       ﬁCome on then, Mr. Creevey,ﬂ said Loc\\nkhart, beaming at Colin. ﬁA double portrait, can™t do \\nbetter than that, and we™ll \\nboth sign it for you.ﬂ        Colin fumbled for his camera and took th\\ne picture as the bell rang behind them, signaling the \\nstart of afternoon classes.  \\n      ﬁOff you go, move along there,\\nﬂ Lockhart called to the crowd, and he set off back to the castle with Harry, who was wishing he knew a good Vanishing Spell, still clasped to his side.  \\n      ﬁA word to the wise, Harry,ﬂ said Lockhart paternally as they entered the building through a side door. ﬁI covered up for you back there with young Creevey Š if he was photographing me, too, \\nyour schoolmates won™t think you™re \\nsetting yourself up so much–ﬂ  \\n      Deaf to Harry™s stammers, Lockhart swept him down a corridor lined \\nwith staring students and up a staircase. \\n \\n      ﬁLet me just say that \\nhanding out signed pictures at this stage of your career isn™t sensible Š looks a tad bigheaded, Harry, to be frank. There may well come a time when, like me, you™ll \\n\\nneed to keep a stack handy wherever you go, butﬂ Š he gave a little chortle Š ﬁI don™t think \\n\\nyou™re quite there yet.ﬂ       They had reached Lockhart™s classroom a\\nnd he let Harry go at last. Harry yanked his robes \\nstraight and headed for a seat at the very back \\nof the class, where he busied himself with piling \\nall seven of Lockhart™s books in front of him, so that he could avoid l\\nooking at the real thing.  \\n      The rest of the class came clattering in, a\\nnd Ron and Hermione sat down on either side of Harry. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁYou could™ve fried an egg on your faceﬂ said Ron. ﬁYou™d better hope Creevey doesn™t meet \\nGinny, or they™ll be starting a Harry Potter fan club.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁShut up,ﬂ snapped Harry. The last thing he needed was for Lockhart to hear the phrase ﬁHarry Potter fan clubﬂ  \\n      When the whole class was seated, Lockhart cl\\neared his throat loudly and silence fell. He reached \\nforward, picked up Neville Longbottom™s copy of \\nTravels with Trolls, and held it up to show his own, winking portrait on the front.  \\n      ﬁMe,ﬂ he said, pointing at it and winking as well. ﬁGilderoy Lockhart, Order of Merlin, Third Class, Honorary Member of the Dark For\\nce Defense League, and five-time winner of \\nWitch Weekly™s Most Charming Smile Award but I don™t talk\\n about that. I didn™t get rid of the Bandon Banshee by smiling at her!ﬂ  \\n      He waited for them to laugh; a few people smiled weakly. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁI see you™ve all bought a complete se\\nt of my books Š well done. I thought we™d start today with a little quiz. Nothing to worry about Š just to check how well you™ve read them, how much you™ve taken in Šﬂ  \\n      When he had handed out the \\ntest papers he returned to the front of the class and said, ﬁYou have thirty minutes Š start Š\\nnow!ﬂ  \\n      Harry looked down at his paper and read: \\n         1.  What is Gilderoy Lockhart™s favorite color? \\n       2.  What is Gilderoy Lockhart™s secret ambition?  \\n      3.  What, in your opinion, is Gild\\neroy Lockhart™s greatest achievement to date? \\n \\n    On and on it went, over three sides of paper, right down to: \\n\\n \\n      54. When is Gilderoy Lockhart™s birthday, and what would his ideal gift be? \\n\\n \\n    Half an hour later, Lockhart\\n collected the papers and rifled through them in front of the class. \\n \\n      ﬁTut, tut Š hardly any of you remembered\\n that my favorite color is lilac. I say so in \\nYear with the Yeti. And a few of you need to read Wanderings with Werewolves more carefully Š I clearly \\nstate in chapter twelve that my ideal birthday gift woul\\nd be harmony between all magic and non-\\nmagic peoples Š though I wouldn™t say no to \\na large bottle of Ogdeds Old Firewhisky!ﬂ \\n       He gave them another roguish wink. Ron wa\\ns now staring at Lockhart with an expression of disbelief on his face; Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas, who were sitting in front, were \\n\\nshaking with silent laughter. Hermione, on the \\nother hand, was listening to Lockhart with rapt attention and gave a start when he mentioned her name. \\n \\n      ﬁ– but Miss Hermione Granger knew my secr\\net ambition is to rid the world of evil and market \\nmy own range of hair-care potions Š good girl! In factﬂ Š he flipped her paper over Š ﬁfull marks! Where is Miss Hermione Granger?ﬂ \\n \\n      Hermione raised a trembling hand. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁExcellent!ﬂ beamed Lockhart. ﬁQuite ex\\ncellent! Take ten points for Gryffindor! And so Š to business Šﬂ  \\n      He bent down behind his desk and lifted a large, \\ncovered cage onto it.  \\n      ﬁNow Š be warned! It is my job to ar\\nm you against the foulest crea\\ntures known to wizardkind! You may find yourselves facing your worst fears \\nin this room. Know only that no harm can \\nbefall you whilst I am here. All I ask is that you remain calm.ﬂ \\n \\n      In spite of himself, Harry leaned around his \\npile of books for a better look at the cage. Lockhart placed a hand on the cover. Dean and Seamus had stopped laughing now. Neville was cowering \\n\\nin his front row seat.  \\n      ﬁI must ask you not to scream,ﬂ said \\nLockhart in a low voice. ﬁIt might provoke them.ﬂ \\n \\n      As the whole class held its breath, Lockhart whipped off the cover. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁYes,ﬂ he said dramatically. \\nﬁFreshly caught Cornish pixies.ﬂ \\n \\n      Seamus Finnigan couldn™t control himself. He\\n let out a snort of laughter that even Lockhart \\ncouldn™t mistake for a scream of terror. \\n \\n      ﬁYes?ﬂ He smiled at Seamus. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁWell, they™re not Š they™re not very Š\\ndangerous, are they?ﬂ Seamus choked. \\n \\n      ﬁDon™t be so sure!ﬂ said Lockhart, waggling a finger annoyingly at Seamus. ﬁDevilish tricky \\nlittle blighters they can be!ﬂ \\n \\n      The pixies were electric blue and about ei\\nght inches high, with pointed \\nfaces and voices so shrill \\nit was like listening to a lot of budgies arguing. The moment the cover had been removed, they \\nhad started jabbering and rocket\\ning around, rattling the bars and making bizarre faces at the \\npeople nearest them. \\n       ﬁRight, then,ﬂ Lockhart said loudly. ﬁLet™s see what you make of them!ﬂ And he opened the \\ncage.  \\n      It was pandemonium. The pixies shot in ever\\ny direction like rockets. Tw\\no of them seized Neville \\nby the ears and lifted him into the air. Several shot straight through \\nthe window, showering the back row with broken glass. The rest proceeded to wreck the classroom more effectively than a \\n\\nrampaging rhino. They grabbed ink bottles and sprayed the class with them, shredded books and \\n\\npapers, tore pictures from the walls, up-ended the waste basket, grabbed bags and books and threw them out of the smashed window; within mi\\nnutes, half the class was sheltering under desks \\nand Neville was swinging from th\\ne iron chandelier in the ceiling.  \\n      ﬁCome on now Š round them up, round th\\nem up, they™re only pixies\\n,ﬂ Lockhart shouted.  \\n      He rolled up his sleeves, brandished his wand, and bellowed, ﬁPeskipiksi Pesternomi!ﬂ  \\n      It had absolutely no effect; one of the pixies seized his wand and threw it out of the window, too. Lockhart gulped and dived under his own des\\nk, narrowly avoiding being squashed by Neville, \\n\\nwho fell a second later as the chandelier gave way.  \\n      The bell rang and there was a mad rush to\\nward the exit. In the relative calm that followed, \\nLockhart straightened up, caught sight of Harry, Ron, and Hermione, who were almost at the \\ndoor, and said, ﬁWell, I™ll ask you th\\nree to just nip the rest of them back into their cage.ﬂ He \\nswept past them and shut th\\ne door quickly behind him. \\n       ﬁCan you believe\\n him?ﬂ roared Ron as one of the remain\\ning pixies bit him painfully on the ear. \\n       ﬁHe just wants to give us some hands-on \\nexperience,ﬂ said Hermione, immobilizing two pixies at \\nonce with a clever Freezing Charm and \\nstuffing them back into their cage. \\n \\n      ﬁHands on? ﬁsaid Harry, who was trying to grab a pixie \\ndancing out of reach with its tongue out. \\nﬁHermione, he didn™t have a clue what he was doing Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁRubbish,ﬂ said Hermione. ﬁYou™ve read \\nhis books Š look at all those amazing things he™s done \\nŠﬂ  \\n      ﬁHe says he™s done,ﬂ Ron muttered. \\n \\n         \\n \\n CHAPTER SEVEN \\n  Mudbloods and Murmurs  \\n  Harry spent a lot of time over the next few da\\nys dodging out of sight whenever he saw Gilderoy Lockhart coming down a corridor. Harder to \\navoid was Colin Creevey, who seemed to have \\nmemorized Harry™s schedule. Nothing seemed to gi\\nve Colin a bigger thrill than to say, ﬁAll right, Harry?ﬂ six or seven times a day and hear, ﬁH\\nello, Colin,ﬂ back, however exasperated Harry sounded when he said it.  \\n      Hedwig was still angry with Harry about the disastrous car journey and Ron™s wand was still malfunctioning, surpassing itself on Friday morni\\nng by shooting out of Ron™s hand in Charms \\nand hitting tiny old Professor Flitwick squarely between the eyes, creating a large, throbbing \\ngreen boil where it had struck. So with one thing \\nand another, Harry was quite glad to reach the \\nweekend. He, Ron, and Hermione were planning to visit Hagrid on Saturday morning. Harry, \\n\\nhowever, was shaken awake seve\\nral hours earlier than he would have liked by Oliver Wood, \\nCaptain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team. \\n \\n      ﬁWhassamatter?ﬂ said Harry groggily. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁQuidditch practice!ﬂ said Wood. ﬁCome on!ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      Harry squinted at the window. There was a thin mist hanging across the pink-and-gold sky. Now \\nthat he was awake, he couldn™t understand how he could have slept through the racket the birds \\nwere making. \\n \\n      ﬁOliver,ﬂ Harry croaked. ﬁIt™s the crack of dawn.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁExactly,ﬂ said Wood. He was a tall and \\nburly sixth year and, at the moment, his eyes were \\ngleaming with a crazed enthusiasm. ﬁIt™s part of our new training program. Come on, grab your \\n\\nbroom, and let™s go,ﬂ said Wood heartily. ﬁNone \\nof the other teams have started training yet; \\nwe™re going to be first off the mark this year Šﬂ \\n \\n      Yawning and shivering slightly, Harry climbe\\nd out of bed and tried to find his Quidditch robes.  \\n      ﬁGood man,ﬂ said Wood. ﬁMeet you on the field in fifteen minutes.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      When he™d found his scarlet team robes \\nand pulled on his cloak for warmth, Harry scribbled a \\nnote to Ron explaining where he™d gone and went down the spiral staircase to the common room, his Nimbus Two Thousand on his shoulder. He had \\njust reached the portrait hole when there was \\na clatter behind him and Colin Creevey came dash\\ning down the spiral staircase, his camera \\nswinging madly around his neck and something clutched in his hand. \\n \\n      ﬁI heard someone saying your name on the \\nstairs, Harry! Look what I™ve got here! I™ve had it developed, I wanted to show you Šﬂ       Harry looked bemusedly at the phot\\nograph Colin was brandishing under his nose. \\n       A moving, black-and-white Lockhart was tu\\ngging hard on an arm Harry recognized as his own. \\nHe was pleased to see that his photographic self was putting up a good fight and refusing to be dragged into view. As Harry watched, Lockhart gave up and slumped, Panting, against the white \\nedge of the picture.  \\n      ﬁWill you sign it?ﬂ said Colin eagerly. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁNo,ﬂ said Harry flatly, glancing around to check that the room was \\nreally deserted. ﬁSorry, Colin, I™m in a hurry Š Quidditch practice Šﬂ \\n \\n      He climbed through the portrait hole. \\n \\n      ﬁOh, wow! Wait for me! I™ve never watched a Quidditch game before!ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      Colin scrambled through the hole after him. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁIt™ll be really boring,ﬂ Harry said qui\\nckly, but Colin ignored him, his face shining with \\nexcitement. \\n \\n      ﬁYou were the youngest House player in a hundred years, weren™t \\nyou, Harry? Weren™t you?ﬂ \\nsaid Colin, trotting alongside him. ﬁYou must be \\nbrilliant. I™ve never flown. Is it easy? Is that \\nyour own broom? Is that \\nthe best one there is?ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry didn™t know how to get rid of him. \\nIt was like having an extremely talkative shadow.  \\n      ﬁI don™t really understand Quidditch,ﬂ said Colin breathlessly. ﬁIs it tr\\nue there are four balls? \\nAnd two of them fly around trying to\\n knock people off their brooms?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁYes,ﬂ said Harry heavily, resigned to explaining the complicated rule\\ns of Quidditch. ﬁThey™re called Bludgers. There are two Beaters on each team\\n who carry clubs to beat the Bludgers away \\nfrom their side. Fred and George \\nWeasley are the Gryffindor Beaters.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁAnd what are the other balls for?ﬂ Colin \\nasked, tripping down a couple of steps because he was \\ngazing open-mouthed at Harry. \\n \\n      ﬁWell, the Quaffle Š that™s the biggish re\\nd one Š is the one that scores goals. Three Chasers on each team throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through the goal posts at the end of \\n\\nthe pitch Š they™re three long poles with hoops on the end.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁAnd the fourth ball Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁŠ is the Golden Snitch,ﬂ said Harry, ﬁand it\\n™s very small, very fast, and difficult to catch. But \\nthat™s what the Seeker™s got to do, because a game of Quidditch doesn™t end until the Snitch has \\nbeen caught. And whichever team™s Seeker gets \\nthe Snitch earns his team an extra hundred and fifty points.ﬂ        ﬁAnd you™re the Gryffindor Seeker, aren™t you?ﬂ said Colin in awe. \\n \\n      ﬁYes,ﬂ said Harry as they left the castle \\nand started across the dew-drenched grass. ﬁAnd there™s \\nthe Keeper, too. He guards the goal posts. That™s it, really.ﬂ  \\n      But Colin didn™t stop questioning Harry all the way down the sloping lawns to the Quidditch field, and Harry only shook him off \\nwhen he reached the changing rooms; Colin called after him \\nin a piping voice, ﬁI™ll go and get a good seat, Harry!ﬂ and hurried off to the stands. \\n \\n      The rest of the Gryffindor team were \\nalready in the changing room. Wood was the only person \\nwho looked truly awake. Fred and George Weas\\nley were sitting, puffy-eyed and touslehaired, \\nnext to fourth year Alicia Spinnet, who seem\\ned to be nodding off against the wall behind her. Her fellow Chasers, Katie Bell and Angelina Johnson, were yawning side by side opposite them. \\n \\n      ﬁThere you are, Harry, what kept you?ﬂ sa\\nid Wood briskly. ﬁNow, I wanted a quick talk with you all before we actually get onto the field, because I spent the summer devising a whole new \\ntraining program, which I really think will make all the difference–ﬂ \\n \\n      Wood was holding up a large diagram of \\na Quidditch field, on which were drawn many lines, \\narrows, and crosses in different colored inks. He took out his wand, tapped the board, and the arrows began to wiggle over the diagram like cate\\nrpillars. As Wood launched into a speech about \\nhis new tactics, Fred Weasley™s head drooped ri\\nght onto Alicia Spinnet™s shoulder and he began to snore.        The first board took nearly twenty minutes\\n to explain, but there was another board under that, and a third under that one. Harry sank into a stupor as Wood droned on and on. \\n       ﬁSo,ﬂ said Wood, at long last, jerking Harry \\nfrom a wistful fantasy abou\\nt what he could be eating for breakfast at this very moment up at th\\ne castle. ﬁIs that cl\\near? Any questions?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁI™ve got a question, Oliver,ﬂ said George, who had woken with a start. ﬁWhy couldn™t you have \\ntold us all this yesterda\\ny when we were awake?ﬂ  \\n      Wood wasn™t pleased. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁNow, listen here, you lot,ﬂ he said, glowering at them all. ﬁWe should have won the Quidditch \\ncup last year. We™re easily the \\nbest team. But unfortunately \\nŠ owing to circumstances beyond \\nour control Šﬂ  \\n      Harry shifted guiltily in his seat. He had been unconscious in the hospital wing for the final \\nmatch of the previous year, meaning that Gry\\nffindor had been a player short and had suffered their worst defeat in three hundred years.  \\n      Wood took a moment to regain control of hi\\nmself. Their last defeat \\nwas clearly still torturing him. \\n       ﬁSo this year, we train harder than ever before– Okay, let™s go and put our new theories into practice!ﬂ Wood shouted, seizing his broomstick a\\nnd leading the way out of the locker rooms. \\nStiff-legged and still yawning, his team followed. \\n \\n      They had been in the locker room so long that the sun was up completely now, although \\nremnants of mist hung over the grass in the stadiu\\nm. As Harry walked onto the field, he saw Ron \\nand Hermione sitting in the stands. \\n \\n      ﬁAren™t you finished yet?ﬂ called Ron incredulously. \\n \\n      ﬁHaven™t even started,ﬂ said Harry, looking jealously at the toast and marmalade Ron and \\nHermione had brought out of the Great Hall.\\n ﬁWood™s been teaching us new moves.ﬂ \\n \\n      He mounted his broomstick and kicked at \\nthe ground, soaring up into the air. The cool morning \\nair whipped his face, waking him far more effectiv\\nely than Wood™s long talk. It felt wonderful to \\nbe back on the Quidditch field. He soared right around the stadium at full speed, racing Fred and \\nGeorge.  \\n      ﬁWhat™s that funny clicking noise?ﬂ \\ncalled Fred as they hurtled around the corner.  \\n      Harry looked into the stands. Colin was sitting in one of the highest seats, his camera raised, \\ntaking picture after picture, the sound strangely magnified in the deserted stadium. \\n \\n      ﬁLook this way, Harry! This way!ﬂ he cried shrilly.        ﬁWho™s that?ﬂ said Fred. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁNo idea,ﬂ Harry lied, putting on a spurt of speed that took him as far away as possible from \\nColin.  \\n      ﬁWhat™s going on?ﬂ said Wood, frowning, as\\n he skimmed through the air toward them. ﬁWhy™s \\nthat first year taking pictures? I \\ndon™t like it. He could be a Slytherin spy, trying to find out about our new training program.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁHe™s in Gryffindor,ﬂ said Harry quickly.  \\n      ﬁAnd the Slytherins don™t need a spy, Oliver,ﬂ said George.  \\n      ﬁWhat makes you say that?ﬂ said Wood testily. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁBecause they™re here in person,ﬂ said George, pointing. \\n\\n \\n      Several people in green robes were wa\\nlking onto the field, broomsticks in their hands. \\n\\n       ﬁI don™t believe it!ﬂ Wood hissed in outrage. ﬁI booked the field for today! We™ll see about this!ﬂ \\n       Wood shot toward the gr\\nound, landing rather harder than he me\\nant to in his anger, staggering slightly as he dismounted. Harr\\ny, Fred, and George followed.  \\n      ﬁFlint!ﬂ Wood bellowed at the Slytherin Capt\\nain. ﬁThis is our practice time! We got up specially! \\nYou can clear off now!ﬂ  \\n      Marcus Flint was even larger than Wood. \\nHe had a look of trollish cunning on his face as he \\nreplied, ﬁPlenty of room for all of us, Wood.ﬂ \\n \\n      Angelina, Alicia, and Katie had come over, too. There were \\nno girls on the Slytherin team, who \\nstood shoulder to shoulder, facing the Gryffindors, leering to a man. \\n \\n      ﬁBut I booked the field!ﬂ said Wood, positively spitting with rage. ﬁI booked it!ﬂ  \\n      ﬁAh,ﬂ said Flint. ﬁBut I™ve got a specially signed note here from Professor Snape. \\n‚I, Professor S. Snape, give the Slytherin team permission to practice today on the Quidditch field owing to the need to train their new Seeker™.\\n ﬂ  \\n      ﬁYou™ve got a new Seeker?ﬂ said Wood, distracted. ﬁWhere?ﬂ \\n \\n      And from behind the six large figures before them came a seventh, smaller boy, smirking all over \\nhis pale, pointed face. It was Draco Malfoy.  \\n      ﬁAren™t you Lucius Malfoy™s son?ﬂ \\nsaid Fred, looking at Malfoy with dislike.  \\n      ﬁFunny you should mention Draco™s father,ﬂ sa\\nid Flint as the whole Slytherin team smiled still \\nmore broadly. ﬁLet me show you the generous \\ngift he™s made to the Slytherin team.ﬂ \\n \\n      All seven of them held\\n out their broomsticks. Seven high\\nly polished, brand-new handles and seven sets of fine gold lettering spelling the words Nimbus Two Thousand and One gleamed \\nunder the Gryffindors™ noses in the early morning sun. \\n \\n      ﬁVery latest model. Only came out last \\nmonth,ﬂ said Flint carelessl\\ny, flicking a speck of dust from the end of his own. ﬁI believe it outstrips\\n the old Two Thousand series by a considerable amount. As for the old Cleansweepsﬂ Š he smiled \\nnastily at Fred and George, who were both clutching Cleansweep Fives Šﬁ sweeps the board with them.ﬂ \\n \\n      None of the Gryffindor team could think \\nof anything to say for a moment. Malfoy was smirking \\nso broadly his cold eyes were reduced to slits.  \\n      ﬁOh, look,ﬂ said Flint. ﬁA field invasion.ﬂ \\n \\n      Ron and Hermione were cro\\nssing the grass to see what was going on. \\n       ﬁWhat™s happening?ﬂ Ron asked Ha\\nrry. ﬁWhy aren™t you playing? And what™s \\nhe doing here?ﬂ        He was looking at Malfoy, taking in his Slytherin Quidditch robes.  \\n      ﬁI™m the new Slytherin Seeker, Weasley,ﬂ said Malfoy, smugly. ﬁEveryone™s just been admiring \\nthe brooms my father™s bought our team. \\n \\n      Ron gaped, open-mouthed, at the se\\nven superb broomsticks in front of him. \\n \\n      ﬁGood, aren™t they?ﬂ said\\n Malfoy smoothly. ﬁBut perhaps the \\nGryffindor team will be able to \\nraise some gold and get new brooms, too. You c\\nould raffle off those Cleansweep Fives; I expect a museum would bid for them.ﬂ \\n \\n      The Slytherin team howled with laughter. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁAt least no one on the Gryffindor team had to \\nbuy their way in,ﬂ said Hermione sharply. ﬁ\\nThey \\ngot in on pure talent.ﬂ  \\n      The smug look on Malfoy™s face flickered. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁNo one asked your opini\\non, you filthy little Mudblood,ﬂ he spat.  \\n      Harry knew at once that Malfoy had said \\nsomething really bad because there was an instant \\nuproar at his words. Flint had to dive in front of Malfoy to stop Fred and George jumping on him, Alicia shrieked, \\nﬁHow dare you!ﬂ\\n and Ron plunged his hand into his robes, pulled out his wand, yelling, ﬁYou™ll pay for that one, Malfoy!ﬂ and pointed it furiously under Flint™s arm at \\nMalfoys face.        A loud bang echoed around the stadium and a \\njet of green light shot out of the wrong end of Ron™s wand, hitting him in the stomach and se\\nnding him reeling backward onto the grass. \\n \\n      ﬁRon! Ron! Are you all right?ﬂ squealed Hermione. \\n \\n      Ron opened his mouth to speak, but no word\\ns came out. Instead he gave an almighty belch and \\nseveral slugs dribbled out of his mouth onto his lap. \\n \\n      The Slytherin team we\\nre paralyzed with laughter. Flint was doubled up, hanging onto his new broomstick for support. Malfoy was on all f\\nours, banging the ground with his fist. The Gryffindors were gathered around Ron, who kept belching large, glistening slugs. Nobody seemed to want to touch him. \\n \\n      ﬁWe™d better get him to Hagrid™s, it™s n\\nearest,ﬂ said Harry to Hermione, who nodded bravely, \\nand the pair of them pulled Ron up by the arms. \\n \\n      ﬁWhat happened, Harry? What happened? Is he\\n ill? But you can cure him, can™t you?ﬂ Colin had \\nrun down from his seat and was now dancing alongs\\nide them as they left the field. Ron gave a huge heave and more slugs dribbled down his front. \\n       ﬁOooh,ﬂ said Colin, fascinated and raising his camera. ﬁCan you hold him still, Harry?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁGet out of the way, Colin!ﬂ said Harry angrily. He and Hermione supported Ron out of the \\nstadium and across the grounds toward the edge of the forest. \\n \\n      ﬁNearly there, Ron,ﬂ said Hermione as \\nthe gamekeeper™s cabin came into view. ﬁYou™ll be all \\nright in a minute Š almost there Šﬂ \\n \\n      They were within twenty feet of Hagr\\nid™s house when the front door opened, but it wasn™t Hagrid who emerged. Gilderoy Lockhart, wearin\\ng robes of palest mauve today, came striding \\nout.  \\n      ﬁQuick, behind here,ﬂ Harry hissed, dragging Ron behind a nearby bush. Hermione followed, \\nsomewhat reluctantly. \\n \\n      ﬁIt™s a simple matter if you know what you\\n™re doing!ﬂ Lockhart was saying loudly to Hagrid. ﬁIf you need help, you know where I am! I™ll let \\nyou have a copy of my book. I™m surprised you \\nhaven™t already got one Š I™ll sign one tonight and send it over. Well, good-bye!ﬂ And he strode \\naway toward the castle. \\n \\n      Harry waited until Lockhart was out of sight, then pulled Ron out of the bush and up to Hagrid™s front door. They knocked urgently.  \\n      Hagrid appeared at once, looking very grumpy, but his expression bri\\nghtened when he saw who it was.  \\n      ﬁBin wonderin™ when you™d come ter see me Š come in, come in Š thought you mighta bin \\nProfessor Lockhart back again Šﬂ  \\n      Harry and Hermione supported Ron over the \\nthreshold into the one-roomed cabin, which had an \\nenormous bed in one corner, a fire crackling merr\\nily in the other. Hagrid\\n didn™t seem perturbed \\nby Ron™s slug problem, which Harry hastily e\\nxplained as he lowered Ron into a chair.  \\n      ﬁBetter out than in,ﬂ he said cheerfully, plunking a large copper basin in front of him. ﬁGet ‚em \\nall up, Ron.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁI don™t think there™s anything to do except wait for it to\\n stop,ﬂ said Hermione anxiously, \\nwatching Ron bend over the basin. ﬁThat™s a difficult curse to work at the best of times, but with \\na broken wand Šﬂ  \\n      Hagrid was bustling around making them \\ntea. His boarhound, Fang, was slobbering over Harry. \\n \\n      ﬁWhat did Lockhart want with y\\nou, Hagrid?ﬂ Harry asked, scratching Fang™s ears.        ﬁGivin™ me advice on gettin™ kelpies out \\nof a well,ﬂ growled Hagrid, moving a half-plucked \\nrooster off his scrubbed table and setting down the teapot. ﬁLike I don™ know. An™ bangin™ on about some banshee he banished. If one \\nword of it was true, I™ll eat my kettle.ﬂ \\n       It was most unlike Hagrid to criticize a Hogwarts™ teacher, and Harry looked at him in surprise. \\nHermione, however, said in a voice somewhat \\nhigher than usual, ﬁI think you™re being a bit unfair. Professor Dumbledore obviously though\\nt he was the best man for the job Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁHe was the on™y man for the job,ﬂ said Hagrid, offering them a plate of treacle fudge, while Ron \\ncoughed squelchily into his basin. ﬁAn™ I mean the \\non™y one. Gettin™ very difficult ter find \\nanyone fer the Dark Arts job. People aren™t too keen ter take it on, see. They™re startin™ ter think it™s jinxed. No one™s lasted long fer a while now. So tell me,ﬂ said\\n Hagrid, jerking his head at Ron. ﬁWho was he tryin™ ter curse?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁMalfoy called Hermione something Š it must™ve been really bad, because everyone went \\nwild.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁIt was bad,ﬂ said Ron hoarsely, emerging over the \\ntabletop looking pale and sweaty. ﬁMalfoy called her ‚Mudblood,™ Hagrid Šﬂ  \\n      Ron dived out of sight again as a fresh wave of slugs made their appearance. Hagrid looked \\noutraged.  \\n      ﬁHe didn™!ﬂ he growled at Hermione. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁHe did,ﬂ she said. ﬁBut I don™t know what it means. I could tell it was really rude, of course Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁIt™s about the most insulting thing \\nhe could think of,ﬂ gasped Ron, coming back up. \\nﬁMudblood™s a really foul name for some\\none who is Muggle-born Š you know, non-magic \\nparents. There are some wizards Š like Malf\\noy™s family Š who think they™re better than \\neveryone else because they™re what people call pu\\nre-blood.ﬂ He gave a small burp, and a single \\nslug fell into his outstretched hand. He threw it into the basin and continued, ﬁI mean, the rest of \\nus know it doesn™t make any difference at a\\nll. Look at Neville Longbottom Š he™s pure-blood and he can hardly stand a cauldron the right way up.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁAn™ they haven™t invented a spell our Hermione can\\n™ do,ﬂ said Hagrid proudly, making \\nHermione go a brilliant shade of magenta. \\n \\n      ﬁIt™s a disgusting thing to call someone,ﬂ said Ron, wiping hi\\ns sweaty brow with a shaking hand. ﬁDirty blood, see. Common blood. It™s ridiculous. Most wizards these days are half-blood \\nanyway. If we hadn™t married Muggles we™d™ve died out.ﬂ  \\n      He retched and ducked out of sight again. \\n \\n      ﬁWell, I don™ blame yeh fer tryin™ ter curse \\nhim, Ron,ﬂ said Hagrid loudly over the thuds of more \\nslugs hitting the basin. ﬁBu™ maybe it was a \\ngood thing yer wand backfired. ™Spect Lucius Malfoy would™ve come marchin™ up ter school if \\nyeh™d cursed his son. Least yer not in trouble.ﬂ        Harry would have pointed out that trouble didn™t come much worse than having slugs pouring \\nout of your mouth, but he couldn™t; Hagrid™s treacle fudge had cemented his jaws together. \\n \\n      ﬁHarry,ﬂ said Hagrid abruptly as though struck by a sudden thought. ﬁGotta bone ter pick with yeh. I™ve heard you™ve bin givin™ out signed photos. How come I haven™t got one?ﬂ \\n \\n      Furious, Harry wrenched his teeth apart. \\n \\n      ﬁI have not been giving out signed photos,ﬂ he said hotly. ﬁIf Lockhart™s still spreading that around Šﬂ  \\n      But then he saw that Hagrid was laughing. \\n \\n      ﬁI™m on™y jokin™,ﬂ he said, patting Harry geni\\nally on the back and sending him face first into the \\ntable. ﬁI knew yeh hadn™t really. I told Lockhart yeh didn™ need teh. Yer more famous than him \\nwithout tryin™.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁBet he didn™t like that,ﬂ said Harry, sitting up and rubbing his chin.  \\n      ﬁDon™ think he did,ﬂ said Hagrid, his eyes twinkling. ﬁAn™ then I told him I™d never read one o™ \\nhis books an™ he decided ter go. Treacle fudge, Ron?ﬂ he added as Ron reappeared. \\n \\n      ﬁNo thanks,ﬂ said Ron weakly. ﬁBetter not risk it.ﬂ \\n\\n       ﬁCome an™ see what I™ve bin growin™,ﬂ said \\nHagrid as Harry and Hermione finished the last of \\ntheir tea.        In the small vegetable patch behind Hagrid™s house were a dozen of the largest pumpkins Harry \\nhad ever seen. Each was the size of a large boulder.  \\n      ﬁGettin™ on well, aren™t they?ﬂ said Hagrid happily. ﬁFer the Halloween feast– should be big \\nenough by then.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁWhat™ve you been \\nfeeding them?ﬂ said Harry. \\n\\n \\n      Hagrid looked over his shoulder to check that they were alone.  \\n      ﬁWell, I™ve bin givin™ them Š you know Š a bit o™ help Šﬂ \\n\\n \\n      Harry noticed Hagrid™s flowery pink umbre\\nlla leaning against the back wall of the cabin. Harry \\nhad had reason to believe before now that this umbrella was not all it look\\ned; in fact, he had the strong impression that Hagrid™s old school wa\\nnd was concealed inside it. Hagrid wasn™t \\nsupposed to use magic. He had been expelled fr\\nom Hogwarts in his third year, but Harry had never found out why Š any mention of the matter \\nand Hagrid would clear his throat loudly and become mysteriously deaf until the subject was changed. \\n       ﬁAn Engorgement Charm, I suppose?ﬂ said Hermione, halfway between disapproval and \\namusement. ﬁWell, you™ve done a good job on them.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁThat™s what yer little sister said,ﬂ said Hagrid, nodding at Ron. ﬁMet her jus™ yesterday.ﬂ Hagrid looked sideways at Harry, his beard twitching. ﬁSaid she was jus™ lookin™ round the grounds, but I reckon she was hopin™ she might run inter someone\\n else at my house.ﬂ He winked at Harry. ﬁIf yeh ask me, \\nshe wouldn™ say no ter a signed Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁOh, shut up,ﬂ said Harry. Ron snorted with laughter and the ground was sprayed with slugs.  \\n      ﬁWatch it!ﬂ Hagrid roared, pulling Ron away from his precious pumpkins. \\n\\n \\n      It was nearly lunchtime and as Harry had \\nonly had one bit of treacle fudge since dawn, he was keen to go back to school to eat. They said good-bye to Hagrid and walked back up to the castle, Ron hiccoughing occasionally, but only bringing up two very small slugs. \\n \\n      They had barely set foot in the cool entrance hall when a voice rang out, ﬁThere you are, Potter Š Weasley.ﬂ Professor McGonagall was walkin\\ng toward them, looking stern. ﬁYou will both do \\nyour detentions this evening.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁWhat™re we doing, Professor?\\nﬂ said Ron, nervously suppressing a burp.  \\n      ﬁYou will be polishing the silver in the trophy room \\nwith Mr. Filch,ﬂ said Professor McGonagall. \\nﬁAnd no magic, Weasley Š elbow grease.ﬂ \\n \\n      Ron gulped. Argus Filch, the caretaker, was loathed by every student in the school.  \\n      ﬁAnd you, Potter, will be helping Professor Lockhart answer his fan mail,ﬂ said Professor \\nMcGonagall.  \\n      ﬁOh n Š Professor, can™t I go and do the trophy room, too?ﬂ said Harry desperately. \\n \\n      ﬁCertainly not,ﬂ said Professor McGonagall, raising her eyebrows. ﬁProfessor Lockhart requested you particularly. Eight o™clock sharp, both of you.ﬂ  \\n      Harry and Ron slouched into the Great Hall in states of deepest gloom, Hermione behind them, \\nwearing a well-you-did-break-school-rules\\n sort of expression. Harry didn™t enjoy his shepherd™s pie as much as he™d thought. Both he \\nand Ron felt they™d got the worse deal.  \\n      ﬁFilch™ll have me there all night,ﬂ said \\nRon heavily. ﬁNo magic! There must be about a hundred \\ncups in that room. I™m \\nno good at Muggle cleaning.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁI™d swap anytime,ﬂ said Harry hollowly. ﬁI™ve had loads of practice with the Dursleys. \\nAnswering Lockhart™s fan mail– he™ll be a nightmare–ﬂ \\n      Saturday afternoon seemed \\nto melt away, and in what seemed like no time, it was five minutes to \\neight, and Harry was dragging his \\nfeet along the second-floor corridor to Lockhart™s office. He gritted his teeth and knocked.        The door flew open at once. Lockhart beamed down at him. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁAh, here™s the scalawag!ﬂ he said. ﬁCome in, Harry, come in Šﬂ \\n\\n \\n      Shining brightly on the walls by the light of many candles were countless framed photographs of \\nLockhart. He had even signed a few of th\\nem. Another large pile lay on his desk. \\n \\n      ﬁYou can address the envelopes!ﬂ Lockhart told Harry, as though this was a huge treat.  \\n      ﬁThis first one™s to Gladys Gudgeon, bless her Š huge fan of mine Šﬂ \\n \\n      The minutes snailed by. Harry let Lockha\\nrt™s voice wash over him, \\noccasionally saying, ﬁMmmﬂ \\nand ﬁRightﬂ and ﬁYeah.ﬂ Now and then he caught a phrase like, ﬁFame™s a fickle friend, Harry,ﬂ \\nor ﬁCelebrity is as celebrity does, remember that.ﬂ \\n \\n      The candles burned lower and lower, ma\\nking the light dance over the many moving faces of \\nLockhart watching him. Harry moved his ach\\ning hand over what felt like the thousandth envelope, writing out Veronica Smethley™s address. \\nIt must be nearly time to leave\\n, Harry thought miserably, \\nplease let it be nearly time–  \\n \\n      And then he heard something Š something qu\\nite apart from the spitting \\nof the dying candles and Lockhart™s prattle about his fans.  \\n      It was a voice, a voice to chill the bone marrow, a voice \\nof breathtaking, ice-cold venom. \\n \\n      ﬁCome– come to me– Let me rip you.. .L\\net me tear you.. .Let me kill you–ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry gave a huge jump and a large lilac blot appeared on Veronica Smethley™s street. \\n \\n      ﬁWhat?ﬂ he said loudly.  \\n      ﬁI know!ﬂ said Lockhart. ﬁSix solid months \\nat the top of the best-seller list! Broke all records!ﬂ  \\n      ﬁNo,ﬂ said Harry frantically. ﬁThat voice!ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁSorry?ﬂ said Lockhart, looking puzzled. ﬁWhat voice?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁThat Š that voice that said Š didn™t you hear it?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      Lockhart was looking at Harry in high astonishment. \\n \\n      ﬁWhat are you talking about, Harry? Perhap\\ns you™re getting a little drowsy? Great Scott Š look \\nat the time! We™ve been here nearly four hours!\\n I™d never have believed it Š the time™s flown, \\nhasn™t it?ﬂ        Harry didn™t answer. He was straining his ears to hear the voice again, but there was no sound now except for Lockhart telling him he mustn™\\nt expect a treat like this every time he got \\ndetention. Feeling dazed, Harry left. \\n \\n      It was so late that the Gryffindor common room was almost em\\npty. Harry went straight up to the dormitory. Ron wasn™t back yet. Harry pulled on \\nhis pajamas, got into bed, and waited. Half an \\n\\nhour later, Ron arrived, nursing his right arm \\nand bringing a strong smell of polish into the \\ndarkened room. \\n \\n      ﬁMy muscles have all seized up,ﬂ he groa\\nned, sinking on his bed. ﬁFourteen times he made me \\nbuff up that Quidditch cup before he was satisfied. And then I had anothe\\nr slug attack all over a Special Award for Services to the School. Took ages to get the slime off– How was it with \\nLockhart?ﬂ  \\n      Keeping his voice low so as not to wake Neville, Dean, and Seamus, Harry told Ron exactly \\nwhat he had heard.  \\n      ﬁAnd Lockhart said he couldn™t hear it?ﬂ said Ron. Harry could see him frowning in the \\nmoonlight. ﬁD™you think he was lying? But I don™\\nt get it Š even someone\\n invisible would™ve had to open the door.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁI know,ﬂ said Harry, lying back in his four-poster and staring at the canopy above him. ﬁI don™t \\nget it either.ﬂ \\n \\n            \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n CHAPTER EIGHT \\n  The Deathday Party    October arrived, spreading a damp chill over the grounds and into the castle. Madam Pomfrey, \\nthe nurse, was kept busy by a sudden spate of co\\nlds among the staff and students. Her Pepperup \\npotion worked instantly, though it left the drinker smoking at the ea\\nrs for several hours afterward. Ginny Weasley, who had been looking \\npale, was bullied into taking some by Percy. \\nThe steam pouring from under her vivid hair gave\\n the impression that her whole head was on \\nfire. Raindrops the size of bullets thundered on the castle windows for days on end; the lake rose, the flower beds turned into muddy streams, and Ha\\ngrid™s pumpkins swelled to the size of garden sheds. Oliver Wood™s enthusiasm for regular \\ntraining sessions, however, was not dampened, which was why Harry was to be found, late one stormy Saturday afternoon a few days before \\nHalloween, returning to Gryffindor Tower, drenched to the skin and splattered with mud.        Even aside from the rain and wind it hadn\\n™t been a happy practice session. Fred and George, who had been spying on the Slytherin team, had seen for themselves the speed of those new Nimbus \\nTwo Thousand and Ones. They reported that the Slytherin team was no more than seven greenish blurs, shooting through the air like missiles. As \\nHarry squelched along the deserted corridor he came across somebody who looked just as preoccupi\\ned as he was. Nearly Headless Nick, the ghost of Gryffindor Tower, was staring morose\\nly out of a window, muttering under his breath, \\nﬁ– don™t fulfill their requirements\\n– half an inch, if that–ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁHello, Nick,ﬂ said Harry. \\n       ﬁHello, hello,ﬂ said Nearly Headless Nick, starting and looking round. He wore a dashing, \\nplumed hat on his long curly hair, and a tunic with \\na ruff, which concealed the fact that his neck was almost completely severed. He was pale as\\n smoke, and Harry could \\nsee right through him to \\nthe dark sky and torrential rain outside.        ﬁYou look troubled, young Potter,ﬂ said Nick, folding a transparent letter as he spoke and tucking it inside his doublet.  \\n      ﬁSo do you,ﬂ said Harry. \\n \\n      ﬁAh,ﬂ Nearly Headless Nick waved an elegant hand, ﬁa matter of no im\\nportance– It™s not as though I really wanted to join– Thought I™d appl\\ny, but apparently I ‚don™t fulfill requirements™ \\nŠﬂ  \\n      In spite of his airy tone, there was a look of great bitterness on his face.  \\n      ﬁBut you would think, wouldn™t you,ﬂ he er\\nupted suddenly, pulling the letter back out of his \\npocket, ﬁthat getting hit forty-five times in the \\nneck with a blunt axe would qualify you to join the Headless Hunt?ﬂ \\n       ﬁOh Š yes,ﬂ said Harry, who was obviously supposed to agree. \\n \\n      ﬁI mean, nobody wishes more than I do that it had all been quick and clean, and my head had \\ncome off properly, I mean, it would have saved me \\na great deal of pain and ridicule. HoweverŠﬂ Nearly Headless Nick shook his letter open and read furiously:   ﬁ‚We can only accept huntsmen whose heads \\nhave parted company with their bodies. You will \\nappreciate that it would be impossible otherwise for members to participate in hunt activities \\nsuch as Horseback Head-Juggling and Head Polo. It is with the greatest regret, therefore, that I must inform you that you do not fulfill our requirements. With very best wishes, Sir Patrick Delaney-Podmore.™ﬂ  \\n  Fuming, Nearly Headless Nick stuffed the letter away. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁHalf an inch of skin and sinew holding my neck on, Harry! Most people would think that™s \\ngood and beheaded, but oh, no, it™s not enough \\nfor Sir Properly Decapitated-Podmore.ﬂ \\n \\n      Nearly Headless Nick took several deep breaths and then said, in a far calmer tone, ﬁSo Š \\nwhat™s bothering you? Anything I can do?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁNo,ﬂ said Harry. ﬁNot unless you know \\nwhere we can get seven free Nimbus Two Thousand \\nand Ones for our match against SlyŠﬂ \\n \\n      The rest of Harry™s sentence was drowned out by a high-pitched mewling from somewhere near \\nhis ankles. He looked down and found himself gazing into a pair of \\nlamp-like yellow eyes. It was \\nMrs. Norris, the skeletal gray cat who was used \\nby the caretaker, Argus Filch, as a sort of deputy \\nin his endless battle against students.  \\n      ﬁYou™d better get out of here, Harry,ﬂ said Nick quickly. ﬁFilch isn™t in a good mood Š he™s got \\nthe flu and some third years accidentally plas\\ntered frog brains all over the ceiling in dungeon five. He™s been cleaning all morning, and if he sees you dripping mud all over the place Šﬂ \\n \\n       ﬁRight,ﬂ said Harry, backing away from the accusing stare of Mrs. Norris, but not quickly \\nenough. Drawn to the spot by the mysterious power th\\nat seemed to connect him with his foul cat, \\nArgus Filch burst suddenly through a tapestry \\nto Harry™s right, wheezing and looking wildly \\nabout for the rule-breaker. There was a thick tartan scarf bound around his head, and his nose was unusually purple.  \\n      ﬁFilth!ﬂ he shouted, his jowls aquiver, \\nhis eyes popping alarmingly as he pointed at the muddy \\npuddle that had dripped from Harry™s Quidditch \\nrobes. ﬁMess and muck everywhere! I™ve had \\nenough of it, I tell you! Follow me, Potter!ﬂ \\n \\n      So Harry waved a gloomy good-bye to \\nNearly Headless Nick and followed Filch back downstairs, doubling the number of\\n muddy footprints on the floor. \\nHarry had never been inside Filch™s office before; it was a place most students avoided. The room was dingy and windowless, \\nlit by a single oil lamp dangling from the low cei\\nling. A faint smell of fried fish lingered about \\nthe place. Wooden filing cabinets stood around the wa\\nlls; from their labels, Harry could see that \\nthey contained details of every pupil Filch had \\never punished. Fred and George Weasley had an \\nentire drawer to themselves. A highly polishe\\nd collection of chains and manacles hung on the \\nwall behind Filch™s desk. It was common knowledge that he was always begging Dumbledore to let him suspend students by their ankles from the ceiling. \\n       Filch grabbed a quill from a pot on his \\ndesk and began shuffling around looking for parchment. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁDung,ﬂ he muttered furiously, ﬁgreat \\nsizzling dragon bogies– frog brains– rat intestines– I™ve had enough of it– make an ex\\nample– where™s the form– yes–ﬂ  \\n      He retrieved a large roll of parchment from his desk drawer and stretche\\nd it out in front of him, \\ndipping his long black quill into the ink pot. \\n \\n      ﬁName– Harry Potter. \\nCrime–ﬂ  \\n      ﬁIt was only a bit of mud!ﬂ said Harry. \\n \\n      ﬁIt™s only a bit of mud to you, boy, but to me\\n it™s an extra hour scrubbing!ﬂ shouted Filch, a drip shivering unpleasantly at the end of his bulbous nose. ﬁCrime– befouling the castle– \\nsuggested sentence–ﬂ  \\n      Dabbing at his streaming nose, Filch s\\nquinted unpleasantly at Harry who waited with bated breath for his sentence to fall.  \\n      But as Filch lowered his quill, there was a great BANG! on the ceiling of the office, which made \\nthe oil lamp rattle. \\n \\n      ﬁPEEVES!ﬂ Filch roared, flinging down his qu\\nill in a transport of rage. ﬁI™ll have you this time, \\nI™ll have you!ﬂ  \\n      And without a backward glance at Harry, Filch ran flat-footed from the office, Mrs. Norris \\nstreaking alongside him. \\n \\n      Peeves was the school poltergeist, a gri\\nnning, airborne menace who lived to cause havoc and \\ndistress. Harry didn™t much like Peeves, but co\\nuldn™t help feeling grateful for his timing. \\nHopefully, whatever Peeves had done (and it sounded as though he™d wrecked something very \\n\\nbig this time) would dist\\nract Filch from Harry.  \\n      Thinking that he should probably wait for Filch to come \\nback, Harry sank into a moth-eaten chair next to the desk. There was only one th\\ning on it apart from his half-completed form: a \\nlarge, glossy, purple envelope with silver lettering on the front. \\nWith a quick glance at the door \\nto check that Filch wasn™t on his way back, Harry picked up the envelope and read:  \\n   \\n   Kwikspell    A Correspondence Course in Beginners™ Magic. \\n       Intrigued, Harry flicked the envelope open and pulled out the sheaf of parchment inside. More \\ncurly silver writing on the front page said:    Feel out of step in the world of modern m\\nagic? Find yourself making excuses not to perform \\nsimple spells? Ever been taunted for your woeful wandwork?     There is an answer! \\n   Kwikspell is an all-new, fail-\\nsafe, quick-result, easy-learn course. Hundreds of witches and wizards have benefited from the Kwikspell method!  \\n  Madam Z. Nettles of Topsham writes: \\n\\n \\n  ﬁI had no memory for incantations and my potio\\nns were a family joke! Now, after a Kwikspell \\ncourse, I am the center of attention at parties and \\nfriends beg for the recipe of my Scintillation Solution!ﬂ  \\n  Warlock D. J. Prod of Didsbury says: \\n\\n \\n  ﬁMy wife used to sneer at my\\n feeble charms, but one month into your fabulous Kwikspell course and I succeeded in turning her into a yak! Thank you, Kwikspell!ﬂ        Fascinated, Harry thumbed through the rest\\n of the envelope™s contents. Why on earth did Filch \\nwant a Kwikspell course? Did this mean he wasn\\n™t a proper wizard? Ha\\nrry was just reading Lesson One: Holding Your Wand (Some Useful Tips) when shuffling footsteps outside told him \\nFilch was coming back. Stuffing the parchment back\\n into the envelope, Harry threw it back onto \\nthe desk just as the door opened.        Filch was looking triumphant. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁThat vanishing cabinet was extremely valuab\\nle!ﬂ he was saying gleefully to Mrs. Norris. ﬁWe™ll \\nhave Peeves out this time, my sweet Šﬂ \\n \\n      His eyes fell on Harry and then darted to the Kwikspell envelope, which, Harry realized too late, \\nwas lying two feet away from where it had started. \\n \\n      Filch™s pasty face went brick red. Harry br\\naced himself for a tidal wave of fury. Filch hobbled \\nacross to his desk, snatched up the envelope, and threw it into a drawer.  \\n      ﬁHave you Š did you read Š?ﬂ he sputtered. \\n\\n \\n       ﬁNo,ﬂ Harry lied quickly.       Filch™s knobbly hands were twisting together.  \\n      ﬁIf I thought you™d read my private Šnot that\\n it™s mine Š for a friend Š be that as it may Š \\nhowever Šﬂ  \\n      Harry was staring at him, alarmed; Filc\\nh had never looked madder. His eyes were popping, a tic \\nwas going in one of his pouchy cheeks, and the tartan scarf didn™t help.  \\n      ﬁVery well Š go Š and don™t breathe a word Š not that Š however, if you didn™t read Š go now, I have to write up Peeves™ report Š go Šﬂ  \\n      Amazed at his luck, Harry sped out of the \\noffice, up the corridor, and back upstairs. To escape \\nfrom Filch™s office without punishment was probably some kind of school record. \\n \\n      ﬁHarry! Harry! Did it work?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      Nearly Headless Nick came gliding out \\nof a classroom. Behind him, Harry could see the \\nwreckage of a large black-and-gol\\nd cabinet that appeared to have been dropped from a great \\nheight.  \\n      ﬁI persuaded Peeves to crash it right over Filch™s office,ﬂ said Nick eagerly. ﬁThought it might \\ndistract him Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWas that you?ﬂ said Harry gratefully. \\nﬁYeah, it worked, I didn™t even get detention. Thanks, Nick!ﬂ        They set off up the corridor together. Nearly Headless Nick, Harry noticed, was still holding Sir \\nPatrick™s rejection letter–         ﬁI wish there was something I could do \\nfor you about the Headless Hunt,ﬂ Harry said. Nearly \\nHeadless Nick stopped in his tracks and Harry walked right through him. He \\nwished he hadn™t; it was like stepping through an icy shower.  \\n      ﬁBut there is something you could do for me,ﬂ said Nick\\n excitedly. ﬁHarry Š would I be asking too much Š but no, you wouldn™t want Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWhat is it?ﬂ said Harry.  \\n\\n ﬁWell, this Halloween will be my five hundredth\\n deathday,ﬂ said Nearly Headless Nick, drawing himself up and looking dignified. \\n \\n      ﬁOh,ﬂ said Harry, not sure whether he should look sorry or happy about this. ﬁRight.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁI™m holding a party down in one of the roomier dungeons. Friends will be coming from all over \\nthe country. It would be such an honor if you would attend. Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger \\n\\nwould be most welcome, too, of course Š but I \\ndaresay you™d rather go to the school feast?ﬂ He \\nwatched Harry on tenterhooks.        ﬁNo,ﬂ said Harry quickly, ﬁI™ll come Šﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁMy dear boy! Harry Potter, at my deathday party! And Šﬂ he hesitated, looking excited ﬁŠ do you think you could possibly mention to Sir Patr\\nick how very frightening and impressive you \\nfind me?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁOf Š of course,ﬂ said Harry. \\n \\n      Nearly Headless Nick beamed at him. \\n\\n \\n  ﬁA deathday party?ﬂ said Hermione keenly when\\n Harry had changed at last and joined her and Ron in the common room. ﬁI bet there aren™t \\nmany living people who can say they™ve been to \\none of those Š it™ll be fascinating!ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWhy would anyone want to celebrate the \\nday they died?ﬂ said Ron, who was halfway through his Potions homework and grumpy. ﬁS\\nounds dead depressing to me–ﬂ \\n \\n    Rain was still lashing the windows, which we\\nre now inky black, but inside all looked bright and cheerful. The firelight glowed over the countless squashy armchairs where people sat reading, \\ntalking, doing homework or, in the case of Fr\\ned and George Weasley, trying to find out what would happen if you fed a Filibuster firework to \\na salamander. Fred had ﬁrescuedﬂ the brilliant \\norange, fire-dwelling lizard from a Care of Ma\\ngical Creatures class and it was now smoldering \\ngently on a table surrounded by a knot of curious people.        Harry was at the point of telling Ron and Hermione about \\nFilch and the Kwikspell course when the salamander suddenly whizzed into the air, emitti\\nng loud sparks and bangs as it whirled wildly \\nround the room. The sight of Percy bellowing himsel\\nf hoarse at Fred and George, the spectacular display of tangerine stars showering from the \\nsalamander™s mouth, and its escape into the fire, \\nwith accompanying explosions, drove both Filch \\nand the Kwikspell envelope from Harry™s mind. \\n   By the time Halloween arrived, Harry was regr\\netting his rash promise to go to the deathday \\nparty. The rest of the school was happily anticipating their Halloween feast; the Great Hall had been decorated with the usual live bats, Hagrid™s vast pumpkins had been\\n carved into lanterns large enough for three men to sit \\nin, and there were rumors that\\n Dumbledore had booked a troupe \\nof dancing skeletons for the entertainment. \\n \\n      ﬁA promise is a promise,ﬂ Hermione reminded Harry bossily. ﬁYou said you™d go to the \\ndeathday party.ﬂ  \\n      So at seven o™clock, Harry, Ron, and Hermio\\nne walked straight past the doorway to the packed Great Hall, which was glittering invitingly with gold plates and candles, and directed their steps instead toward the dungeons.  \\n      The passageway leading to Nearly Headless Nick™s party had been lined with candles, too, though the effect was far from cheerful: These were\\n long, thin, jet-black tapers, all burning bright blue, casting a dim, ghostly light even over thei\\nr own living faces. The temperature dropped with \\nevery step they took. As Harry shivered and drew his robes tightly around him, he heard what \\nsounded like a thousand fingernails scraping an enormous blackboard. \\n       ﬁIs that supposed to be music?ﬂ Ron whispered. They turned a \\ncorner and saw Nearly Headless \\nNick standing at a doorway hung with black velvet drapes. \\n \\n      ﬁMy dear friends,ﬂ he said mournfull\\ny. ﬁWelcome, welcome– so pleased you could come–ﬂ \\n \\n      He swept off his plumed hat and bowed them inside. \\n\\n \\n      It was an incredible sight. The dungeon was full of hundreds of pearly-white, translucent people, mostly drifting around a crowded dance floor, waltzing to the dreadful, quavering sound of thirty musical saws, played by an orchestra on a rais\\ned, black-draped platform. A chandelier overhead \\nblazed midnight-blue with a thousand more black \\ncandles. Their breath rose in a mist before \\nthem; it was like stepping into a freezer. \\n \\n      ﬁShall we have a look around?ﬂ Ha\\nrry suggested, wanting to warm up his feet. \\n \\n      ﬁCareful not to walk through anyone,ﬂ said Ron nervously, and they set off around the edge of \\nthe dance floor. They passed a group of gloomy \\nnuns, a ragged man wearing chains, and the Fat \\nFriar, a cheerful Hufflepuff ghost, who was talking to a knight with an arrow sticking out of his forehead. Harry wasn™t surprised to see that the Bloody Baron, a gaunt, staring Slytherin ghost covered in silver bloodstains, was being given a wide berth by the other ghosts.        ﬁOh, no,ﬂ said Hermione, stopping abruptly. \\nﬁTurn back, turn back, I don™t want to talk to Moaning Myrtle Šﬂ        ﬁWho?ﬂ said Harry \\nas they backtracked quickly. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁShe haunts one of the toilets in the girls™ bathroom on the first floor,ﬂ said Hermione. \\n \\n      ﬁShe haunts a toilet\\n?ﬂ  \\n      ﬁYes. It™s been out-of-order all year because she keeps having tantrums and flooding the place. I \\nnever went in there anyway if I could avoid it; it™s awful trying to have a pee with her wailing at you Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁLook, food!ﬂ said Ron. \\n\\n \\n      On the other side of the dungeon was a long table, also covered in black velvet. They approached \\nit eagerly but next moment had stopped in their \\ntracks, horrified. The smell was quite disgusting. \\nLarge, rotten fish were laid on handsome silver\\n platters; cakes, burned charcoal-black, were \\nheaped on salvers; there was a great maggoty haggi\\ns, a slab of cheese covered in furry green \\nmold and, in pride of place, an enormous gray cake in the shape of a tombstone, with tar-like \\nicing forming the words, \\n     SIR NICHOLAS DE MIMSY-PORPINGTON \\n\\n \\n  DIED 31ST OCTOBER, 1492 \\n\\n \\n      Harry watched, amazed, as a portly ghost ap\\nproached the table, crouched low, and walked through it, his mouth held wide so that \\nit passed through one of the stinking salmon. \\n \\n      ﬁCan you taste it if you walk though it?ﬂ Harry asked him. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁAlmost,ﬂ said the g\\nhost sadly, and he drifted away.  \\n      ﬁI expect they™ve let it rot to give it a stronger flavor,ﬂ said Hermione knowledgeably, pinching \\nher nose and leaning closer to look at the putrid haggis.  \\n      ﬁCan we move? I feel sick,ﬂ said Ron. \\n\\n \\n      They had barely turned around, however, when a little man swooped suddenly from under the \\ntable and came to a halt in midair before them. \\n \\n      ﬁHello, Peeves,ﬂ said Harry cautiously. \\n \\n      Unlike the ghosts around them, Peeves the \\nPoltergeist was the very reverse of pale and \\ntransparent. He was wearing a br\\night orange party hat, a revolving bow tie, and a broad grin on his wide, wicked face.  \\n      ﬁNibbles?ﬂ he said sweetly, offe\\nring them a bowl of peanuts covered in fungus. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁNo thanks,ﬂ said Hermione. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁHeard you talking about poor Myrtle,ﬂ said Peeves, his eyes dancing. ﬁRude you was about poor Myrtle.ﬂ He took a deep breath and bellowed, ﬁOY! MYRTLE!ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁOh, no, Peeves, don™t tell her what I sai\\nd, she™ll be really upset,ﬂ Hermione whispered \\nfrantically. ﬁI didn™t mean it, I don\\n™t mind her Š er, hello, Myrtle.ﬂ \\n \\n      The squat ghost of a girl had glided over. She had the glummest face Harry had ever seen, half-\\nhidden behind lank hair and thick, pearly spectacles. \\n \\n      ﬁWhat?ﬂ she said sulkily. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁHow are you, Myrtle?ﬂ said Hermione in a fa\\nlsely bright voice. ﬁIt™s nice to see you out of the \\ntoilet.ﬂ  \\n      Myrtle sniffed.        ﬁMiss Granger was just talking about you Šﬂ \\nsaid Peeves slyly in Myrtle™s ear. ﬁJust saying Šﬂ \\n      ﬁJust saying Š saying Š how nice you look tonight,ﬂ said Hermione, glaring at Peeves. \\n \\n      Myrtle eyed Hermione suspiciously. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁYou™re making fun of me,ﬂ she said, silver\\n tears welling rapidly in her small, see-through eyes. \\n \\n      ﬁNo Š honestly Š didn™t I just say how nice Myrtle™s looking?ﬂ said Hermione, nudging Harry \\nand Ron painfully in the ribs.  \\n      ﬁOh, yeah Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁShe did Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁDon™t lie to me,ﬂ Myrtle gasped, tear\\ns now flooding down her face, while Peeves chuckled happily over her shoulder. ﬁD™you think I don™t know what people call me behind my back? Fat \\nMyrtle! Ugly Myrtle! Miserable, moaning, moping Myrtle!ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁYou™ve forgotten pimply,ﬂ Peeves hissed in her ear. \\n \\n      Moaning Myrtle burst into anguished sobs and fled from the dungeon. Peeves shot after her, \\npelting her with moldy peanuts, yelling, ﬁ\\nPimply! Pimply!ﬂ  \\n      ﬁOh, dear,ﬂ said Hermione sadly. \\n\\n       Nearly Headless Nick now drifted toward them through the crowd. \\n       ﬁEnjoying yourselves?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁOh, yes,ﬂ they lied. \\n \\n      ﬁNot a bad turnout,ﬂ \\nsaid Nearly Headless Nick proudly. ﬁThe Wailing Widow came all the way \\nup from Kent– It™s nearly time for my speech, I™d better go and warn the orchestra–ﬂ \\n \\n      The orchestra, however, stopped playing at that very moment. They, and everyone else in the \\ndungeon, fell silent, looking around in excitement, as a hunting horn sounded. \\n \\n      ﬁOh, here we go,ﬂ said Nearly Headless Nick bitterly. \\n \\n      Through the dungeon wall burst a dozen ghost horses, each ridden by a headless horseman. The \\nassembly clapped wildly; Harry started to clap, \\ntoo, but stopped quickly at the sight of Nick™s face.  \\n      The horses galloped into the middle of th\\ne dance floor and halted, rearing and plunging. At the front of the pack was a large ghost who held \\nhis bearded head under his arm, from which \\nposition he was blowing the horn. The ghost leapt \\ndown, lifted his head high in the air so he could see over the crowd (everyone laughed), and strode over to Nearly Headless Nick, squashing his head back onto his neck.        ﬁNick!ﬂ he roared. ﬁHow are you? Head still hanging in there?ﬂ \\n \\n      He gave a hearty guffaw and clapped Nearly Headless \\nNick on the shoulder.  \\n      ﬁWelcome, Patrick,ﬂ said Nick stiffly. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁLive ™uns!ﬂ said Sir Patrick, spotting Harry, Ron, and Hermione and giving a huge, fake jump \\nof astonishment, so that his head fell o\\nff again (the crowd howled with laughter).  \\n      ﬁVery amusing,ﬂ said Nearly Headless Nick darkly. \\n \\n      ﬁDon™t mind Nick!ﬂ shouted \\nSir Patrick™s head from the floor. \\nﬁStill upset we won™t let him join \\nthe Hunt! But I mean to say Š look at the fellow Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁI think,ﬂ said Harry hurriedly, at a mean\\ningful look from Nick, ﬁNick™s very Š frightening and Š er Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁHa!ﬂ yelled Sir Patrick™s head. \\n \\n      ﬁBet he asked you to say that!ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁIf I could have everyone™s attention, it\\n™s time for my speech!ﬂ said Nearly Headless Nick \\nloudly, striding toward the podium and c\\nlimbing into an icy blue spotlight. \\n \\n      ﬁMy late lamented lords, ladies, and gentlemen, it is my great sorrow–ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      But nobody heard much more. Sir Patrick and \\nthe rest of the Headless Hunt had just started a game of Head Hockey and the crowd were turnin\\ng to watch. Nearly Headless Nick tried vainly \\n\\nto recapture his audience, but gave up as Sir Patrick™s head went sailing past him to loud cheers. \\n \\n      Harry was very cold by now, not to mention hungry. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁI can™t stand much more of this,ﬂ R\\non muttered, his teeth chattering, as the orchestra ground \\nback into action and the ghosts swept back onto the dance floor.  \\n      ﬁLet™s go,ﬂ Harry agreed. \\n \\n      They backed toward the door, nodding and beaming at anyone who looked at them, and a minute \\nlater were hurrying back up the passageway full of black candles. \\n \\n      ﬁPudding might not be fini\\nshed yet,ﬂ said Ron hopefully, leading the way toward the steps to the entrance hall. \\n      And then Harry heard it.  \\n      ﬁ– rip– tear– kill\\n–ﬂ  \\n      It was the same voice, the same cold, \\nmurderous voice he had heard in Lockhart™s office. \\n \\n      He stumbled to a halt, clutching at the stone wall, listening with all his might, looking around, \\nsquinting up and down the dimly lit passageway. \\n \\n      ﬁHarry, what™re you Š?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁIt™s that voice again Š shut up a minute Šﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁ– soo hungry– for so long\\n–ﬂ  \\n      ﬁListen!ﬂ said Harry urgently, and Ron and Hermione froze, watching him. \\n \\n      ﬁ– kill– time to kill\\n–ﬂ  \\n      The voice was growing fainter. Harry\\n was sure it was moving away Š moving upward. A \\nmixture of fear and excitement gripped him as \\nhe stared at the dark ceiling; how could it be \\nmoving upward? Was it a phantom, to whom stone ceilings didn™t matter? \\n \\n      ﬁThis way,ﬂ he shouted, and he began to run, up the stairs, into the entrance hall. It was no good hoping to hear anything here, the babble of talk from the Halloween feast was echoing out of the \\nGreat Hall. Harry sprinted up the marble staircase to the first fl\\noor, Ron and Hermione clattering \\nbehind him. \\n \\n      ﬁHarry, what™re we Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁSHH!ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry strained his ears. Distantly, from th\\ne floor above, and growing fainter still, he heard the \\nvoice: ﬁ– I smell blood– I SMELL BLOOD!ﬂ  \\n      His stomach lurched Š \\n \\n      ﬁIt™s going to kill someone!ﬂ he shouted, \\nand ignoring Ron™s and Hermi\\none™s bewildered faces, he ran up the next flight of steps three at a time, trying to \\nlisten over his own pounding footsteps Š Harry hurtled around the whole of the second floor, Ron and Hermione panting behind him, \\nnot stopping until they turned a corner into the last, deserted passage. \\n \\n      ﬁHarry, what was that all about?ﬂ said Ron, wiping sweat off his face. ﬁI couldn™t hear \\nanything–ﬂ  \\n      But Hermione gave a sudden gasp, pointing down the corridor. \\n      ﬁLook!ﬂ        Something was shining on the wall ahea\\nd. They approached slowly, squinting through the \\ndarkness. Foot-high words had been daubed on the wall between two windows, shimmering in \\nthe light cast by the flaming torches. \\n   THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS HAS BEEN OPENED.  \\n ENEMIES OF THE HEIR, BEWARE        ﬁWhat™s that thing Š hanging undernea\\nth?ﬂ said Ron, a slight quiver in his voice. \\n \\n      As they edged nearer, Harry almost slipped Š there was a large puddle of water on the floor; Ron and Hermione grabbed him, and they inch\\ned toward the message, eyes fixed on a dark \\nshadow beneath it. All three of them realized what it was at once, and leapt backward with a \\nsplash.  \\n      Mrs. Norris, the caretaker™s cat, was hanging by her tail from \\nthe torch bracket. She was stiff as a board, her eyes wide and staring.  \\n      For a few seconds, they didn™t move. Then Ron said, ﬁLet™s get out of here.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁShouldn™t we try and help Šﬂ Harry began awkwardly.  \\n      ﬁTrust me,ﬂ said Ron. ﬁWe don™t want to be found here.ﬂ \\n\\n       But it was too late. A rumble, as though of di\\nstant thunder, told them that the feast had just ended. From either end of the corridor where they stood came the sound of hundreds of feet \\nclimbing the stairs, and the loud, happy talk of \\nwell-fed people; next moment, students were \\ncrashing into the passage from both ends. \\n \\n      The chatter, the bustle, the noise died suddenly as the people in front spotted the hanging cat. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood alone, in the middl\\ne of the corridor, as silence fell among the mass of students pressing forward to see the grisly sight. \\n \\n      Then someone shouted through the quiet. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁEnemies of the Heir, beware! You™ll be next, Mudbloods!ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      It was Draco Malfoy. He had pushed to the front of the crowd, his cold eyes alive, his usually \\nbloodless face flushed, as he grinned at the sight of the hanging, immobile cat.  \\n        CHAPTER NINE \\n  The Writing on the Wall \\n    ﬁWhat™s going on here? What™s going on?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      Attracted no doubt by Malfoy™s shout, Argus Filch came shouldering his way through the crowd. \\nThen he saw Mrs. Norris and fell back, clutching his face in horror. \\n \\n      ﬁMy cat! My cat! What™s happ\\nened to Mrs. Norris?ﬂ he shrieked.  \\n      And his popping eyes fell on Harry. \\n \\n      ﬁYou!ﬂ he screeched. ﬁ\\nYou! You™ve murdered my cat! You™ve \\nkilled her! I™ll kill you! I™ll Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁArgus!ﬂ \\n \\n      Dumbledore had arrived on the scene, follo\\nwed by a number of other teachers. In seconds, he \\nhad swept past Harry, Ron, and Hermione and de\\ntached Mrs. Norris from the torch bracket.  \\n      ﬁCome with me, Argus,ﬂ he said to F\\nilch. ﬁYou, too, Mr. Potter, Mr. Weasley, Miss Granger.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      Lockhart stepped forward eagerly. \\n \\n      ﬁMy office is nearest, Headmast\\ner Š just upstairs Š please feel free Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁThank you, Gilderoy,ﬂ said Dumbledore. \\n \\n      The silent crowd parted to let them pass. Lockhart, looking excited and important, hurried after \\nDumbledore; so did Professo\\nrs McGonagall and Snape.  \\n      As they entered Lockhart™s darkened office there was a flurry of movement across the walls; \\nHarry saw several of the Lockharts in the pictures dodging out of sight, their hair in rollers. The \\n\\nreal Lockhart lit the candles on his desk and \\nstood back. Dumbledore lay Mrs. Norris on the polished surface and began to examine her. Harry, Ron, and Hermione exchanged tense looks \\n\\nand sank into chairs outside the pool of candlelight, watching.  \\n      The tip of Dumbledore™s long, crooked nose was barely an inch from Mrs. Norris™s fur. He was \\nlooking at her closely through his half-moon spectacles, his long \\nfingers gently prodding and poking. Professor McGonagall was bent almost as\\n close, her eyes narrowed. Snape loomed \\nbehind them, half in shadow, wearing a most p\\neculiar expression: It was as though he was trying hard not to smile. And Lockhart was hoveri\\nng around all of them, making suggestions. \\n \\n      ﬁIt was definitely a curse that killed her Š probably the Transmogrifian Torture Š I™ve seen it \\nused many times, so unlucky I wasn™t there, I kno\\nw the very countercurse that would have saved her–ﬂ        Lockhart™s comments were punctuated by F\\nilch™s dry, racking sobs. He was slumped in a chair \\nby the desk, unable to look at Mrs. Norris, his fa\\nce in his hands. Much as he detested Filch, Harry couldn™t help feeling a bit sorry for him, though not nearly as \\nsorry as he felt for himself If \\nDumbledore believed Filch, he w\\nould be expelled for sure.  \\n      Dumbledore was now muttering strange word\\ns under his breath and tapping Mrs. Norris with his wand but nothing happened. She continued to look as though she had been recently stuffed.  \\n      ﬁ– I remember something very similar ha\\nppening in Ouagadogou,ﬂ said Lockhart, ﬁa series of attacks, the full story™s in my autobiography, I wa\\ns able to provide the townsfolk with various amulets, which cleared the matter up at once–ﬂ \\n \\n      The photographs of Lockhart on the walls were all nodding in agreement as he talked. One of them had forgotten to remove his hair net. \\n \\n      At last Dumbledore straightened up. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁShe™s not dead, Argus,ﬂ he said softly. \\n \\n      Lockhart stopped abruptly in the middle of\\n counting the number of mu\\nrders he had prevented. \\n \\n      ﬁNot dead?ﬂ choked Filc\\nh, looking through his fingers at Mrs. Norris. ﬁBut why™s she all Š all stiff and frozen?ﬂ \\n       ﬁShe has been Petrified,ﬂ said Dumbledore (ﬁAh! I thought so!ﬂ said Lockhart). ﬁBut how, I cannot say–ﬂ        ﬁAsk him!ﬂ shrieked Filch, turning his blotched and tearstained face to Harry.  \\n      ﬁNo second year could have done this,ﬂ said Dumbledore firmly. ﬁit w\\nould take Dark Magic of the most advanced Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁHe did it, he did it!ﬂ Filch spat, his \\npouchy face purpling. ﬁYou saw what he wrote on the wall! \\nHe found Š in my office Š he knows I™m a Š I™m a Šﬂ Filch™s face worked horribly. ﬁHe \\n\\nknows I™m a Squib!ﬂ he finished. \\n \\n      ﬁI never touched Mrs. Norris!ﬂ Harry said loudly, uncomfortably aware of everyone looking at him, including all the Lockharts on the wa\\nlls. ﬁAnd I don™t even know what a Squib \\nis.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁRubbish!ﬂ snarled Filch. ﬁHe saw my Kwikspell letter!ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁIf I might speak, Headmaster,ﬂ said Sn\\nape from the shadows, and Harry™s sense of foreboding \\nincreased; he was sure nothing Snape had to say was going to do him any good. \\n       ﬁPotter and his friends may have simply \\nbeen in the wrong place at the wrong time,ﬂ he said, a \\nslight sneer curling his mouth as though he doubted it. ﬁBut we do have a set of suspicious circumstances here. Why was he in the upstairs co\\nrridor at all? Why wasn™t\\n he at the Halloween feast?ﬂ        Harry, Ron and Hermione all launched into\\n an explanation about the deathday party. ﬁ– there were hundreds of ghosts, they™ll tell you we were there Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁBut why not join the feast afterward?ﬂ said Snape, his black\\n eyes glittering in the candlelight. ﬁWhy go up to that corridor?ﬂ \\n \\n      Ron and Hermione looked at Harry. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁBecause Š because Šﬂ Harry said, his heart thumping very fast; something told him it would \\nsound very far-fetched if he told them he had been led there by a bodiless voice no one but he could hear, ﬁbecause we were tired and wanted to go to bed,ﬂ he said. \\n \\n      ﬁWithout any supper?ﬂ said Snape, a triumpha\\nnt smile flickering across hi\\ns gaunt face. ﬁI didn™t think ghosts provided food fit for living people at their parties.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁWe weren™t hungry,ﬂ said Ron l\\noudly as his stomach gave a huge rumble. \\n \\n      Snape™s nasty smile widened. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁI suggest, Headmaster, that Potter is not be\\ning entirely truthful,ﬂ he said. ﬁIt might be a good \\nidea if he were deprived of certain privileges \\nuntil he is ready to te\\nll us the whole story. I personally feel he should be taken off the Gryffindor Quidditch team unt\\nil he is ready to be honest.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁReally, Severus,ﬂ said Professor McGonagall sharply, ﬁI see no reason to stop the boy playing Quidditch. This cat wasn™t hit over the head with \\na broomstick. There is no evidence at all that \\nPotter has done anything wrong.ﬂ  \\n      Dumbledore was giving Harry a searching \\nlook. His twinkling light-blue gaze made Harry feel \\nas though he were being X-rayed.  \\n      ﬁInnocent until proven guilty, Severus,ﬂ he said firmly. \\n\\n \\n      Snape looked furious. \\n \\n      So did Filch. \\n \\n      ﬁMy cat has been Petrified!ﬂ he shrieked, his eyes popping. ﬁI want to see some \\npunishment!ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWe will be able to cure her, Argus,ﬂ said Dumbledore patiently. ﬁProfessor Sprout recently \\nmanaged to procure some Mandrakes. As soon as th\\ney have reached their full size, I will have a \\npotion made that will revive Mrs. Norris.ﬂ \\n       ﬁI™ll make it,ﬂ Lockhart\\n butted in. ﬁI must have done it \\na hundred times. I could whip up a \\nMandrake Restorative Draught in my sleep Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁExcuse me,ﬂ said Snape icily. ﬁBut I \\nbelieve I am the Potions \\nmaster at this school.ﬂ \\n \\n      There was a very awkward pause. \\n \\n      ﬁYou may go,ﬂ Dumbledore said to Harry, Ron, and Hermione. \\n\\n \\n      They went, as quickly as they could without actually running. When th\\ney were a floor up from Lockhart™s office, they turned into an empty classroom and clos\\ned the door quietly behind them. \\nHarry squinted at his friends™ darkened faces. \\n \\n      ﬁD™you think I should have told them about that voice I heard?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁNo,ﬂ said Ron, without hesitation. ﬁHearing voices no one else can hear isn™t a good sign, even in the wizarding world.ﬂ  \\n      Something in Ron™s voice made \\nHarry ask, ﬁYou do believe me, don™t you?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁ™Course I do,ﬂ said Ron quickly. ﬁBut Š you must admit it™s weird–ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁI know it™s weird,ﬂ said Harry. ﬁThe whole thing™s weird. What was that writing on the wall \\nabout? \\nThe Chamber Has Been Opened– What™s that supposed to mean?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁYou know, it rings a sort of bell,ﬂ said Ron slowly. ﬁI think someone told me a story about a \\nsecret chamber at Hogwarts once– might™ve been Bill–ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁAnd what on earth™s a Squib?ﬂ said Harry. \\n\\n \\n      To his surprise, Ron stifled a snigger. \\n \\n      ﬁWell Š it™s not funny real\\nly Š but as it™s Filch,ﬂ he said. ﬁA Squib is someone who was born \\ninto a wizarding family but hasn™t got any \\nmagic powers. Kind of the opposite of Muggle-born \\nwizards, but Squibs are quite unusual. If Filch™s trying to learn magic fr\\nom a Kwikspell course, I reckon he must be a Squib. It w\\nould explain a lot. Like why he hates students so much.ﬂ Ron \\ngave a satisfied smile. ﬁHe™s bitter.ﬂ \\n \\n      A clock chimed somewhere. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁMidnight,ﬂ said Harry. ﬁWe™d better get to\\n bed before Snape comes along and tries to frame us \\nfor something else.ﬂ \\n \\n     For a few days, the school could talk of little else but the attack on Mrs. Norris. Filch kept it \\nfresh in everyone™s minds by pacing the spot wh\\nere she had been attacked, as though he thought the attacker might come back. \\nHarry had seen him scrubbing the message on the wall with Mrs. \\n\\nSkower™s All-Purpose Magical Mess Remover, but\\n to no effect; the words still gleamed as \\nbrightly as ever on the stone. When Filch wasn\\n™t guarding the scene of the crime, he was \\nskulking red-eyed through the corridors, lunging out at unsuspecting students and trying to put them in detention for things like \\nﬁbreathing loudly™ and ﬁlooking happy.ﬂ  \\n      Ginny Weasley seemed very disturbed by Mrs.\\n Norris™s fate. According to Ron, she was a great cat lover. \\n \\n      ﬁBut you haven™t really got to know Mrs. Norris,ﬂ Ron told her bracingly. ﬁHonestly, we™re much better off without her.ﬂ Ginny™s lip trembl\\ned. ﬁStuff like this doesn™t often happen at Hogwarts,ﬂ Ron assured her. ﬁThey™ll catch the maniac w\\nho did it and have him out of here in no \\ntime. I just hope he™s got time to Petrify F\\nilch before he™s expelled. I™m only joking Šﬂ Ron \\nadded hastily as Ginny blanched.  \\n      The attack had also had an effect on Hermi\\none. It was quite usual for Hermione to spend a lot of \\ntime reading, but she was now doing almost not\\nhing else. Nor could Harry and Ron get much \\nresponse from her when they asked what she was up to, and not until the following Wednesday did they find out.  \\n      Harry had been held back in Potions, where Snape had made him stay behind to scrape \\ntubeworms off the desks. After a hurried lunch, he\\n went upstairs to meet Ron in the library, and \\nsaw Justin Finch-Fletchley, the Hufflepuff boy \\nfrom Herbology, coming toward him. Harry had \\njust opened his mouth to say hello \\nwhen Justin caught sight of him,\\n turned abruptly, and sped off in the opposite direction.  \\n      Harry found Ron at the back of the library, measuring his History of\\n Magic homework. Professor \\nBinns had asked for a three foot long compositi\\non on ﬁThe Medieval Assembly of European Wizards.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁI don™t believe it, I™m s\\ntill eight inches short said Ron furi\\nously, letting go of his parchment, \\nwhich sprang back into a roll. ﬁAnd Hermione™s\\n done four feet seven inches and her writing™s \\ntiny.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁWhere is she?ﬂ asked Harry, grabbing \\nthe tape measure and unrolling his own homework. \\n \\n      ﬁSomewhere over there,ﬂ said Ron, poi\\nnting along the shelves. ﬁLooking for another book. I think she™s trying to read the whole library before Christmas.ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry told Ron about Justin Finch-Fletchley running away from him. \\n \\n      ﬁDunno why you care. I thought he was a bit of an idiot,ﬂ said Ron, scribbling away, making his \\nwriting as large as possible. ﬁAll that junk about Lockhart being so great Šﬂ        Hermione emerged from between the bookshelv\\nes. She looked irritable and at last seemed ready \\nto talk to them. \\n       ﬁAll the copies of Hogwarts, A History have been taken out,ﬂ she said, sitting down next to Harry and Ron. ﬁAnd there™s a two-week waiting list. I \\nwish I hadn™t left my copy at home, but I \\ncouldn™t fit it in my trunk with all the Lockhart books.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWhy do you want it?ﬂ said Harry. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁThe same reason everyone else wants it,\\nﬂ said Hermione, ﬁto read up on the legend of the \\nChamber of Secrets.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWhat™s that?ﬂ said Harry quickly. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁThat™s just it. I can™t remember,ﬂ said\\n Hermione, biting her lip. ﬁAnd I can™t find the story \\nanywhere else Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁHermione, let me read your compos\\nition,ﬂ said Ron desperately, checking his watch. \\n \\n      ﬁNo, I won™t,ﬂ said Hermione, suddenly \\nsevere. ﬁYou™ve had ten days to finish it Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁI only need another two inches, come on Šﬂ \\n \\n      The bell rang. Ron and Hermione le\\nd the way to History of Magic, bickering. \\n \\n      History of Magic was the dullest subject on their schedule. Professor Binns, who taught it, was their only ghost teacher, and the most exciting thing that ever \\nhappened in his classes was his entering the room through the blackboard. Anci\\nent and shriveled, many people said he hadn™t \\nnoticed he was dead. He had simply got up to teach one day and left his body behind him in an \\n\\narmchair in front of the staff room fire; his \\nroutine had not varied in the slightest since. \\n \\n      Today was as boring as ever. Professor Binns\\n opened his notes and began to read in a flat drone like an old vacuum cleaner until nearly everyone \\nin the class was in a deep stupor, occasionally coming to long enough to copy down a name or da\\nte, then falling asleep again. He had been \\n\\nspeaking for half an hour when something happe\\nned that had never happened before. Hermione \\nput up her hand.  \\n      Professor Binns, glancing up in the middle of\\n a deadly dull lecture on the International Warlock \\nConvention of 1289, looked amazed. \\n \\n      ﬁMiss Š er Š?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁGranger, Professor. I was wondering if you could tell us anything about the Chamber of Secrets,ﬂ said Hermione in a clear voice. \\n \\n      Dean Thomas, who had been sitting w\\nith his mouth hanging open, gazing out of the window, jerked out of his trance; Lave\\nnder Brown™s head came up off her arms and Neville Longbottom™s \\nelbow slipped off his desk.        Professor Binns blinked. \\n \\n      ﬁMy subject is History of Magic,ﬂ he said in his dry, wheezy voice. ﬁI deal with facts, Miss Granger, not myths and legends.ﬂ He cleared his th\\nroat with a small noise like chalk slipping and \\ncontinued, ﬁIn September of that year, a \\nsubcommittee of Sardinian sorcerers Šﬂ \\n \\n      He stuttered to a halt. Hermione™s hand was waving in the air again.  \\n      ﬁMiss Grant?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁPlease, sir, don™t legends always have a basis in fact?ﬂ \\n \\n      Professor Binns was looking at her in such amazement, Harry was sure no student had ever \\ninterrupted him before, alive or dead. \\n \\n      ﬁWell,ﬂ said Professor Binns slowly, ﬁy\\nes, one could argue that, I suppose.ﬂ He peered at Hermione as though he had never seen a student \\nproperly before. ﬁHowever, the legend of which you speak is such a very sensational, even ludicrous tale Šﬂ  \\n      But the whole class was now hanging on Professor Binns™s every word. He looked dimly at them \\nall, every face turned to his. Ha\\nrry could tell he was completely \\nthrown by such an unusual show of interest.        ﬁOh, very well,ﬂ he said slowly. ﬁLet me see– the Chamber of Secrets–  \\n       ﬁYou all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago Š the precise date is uncertain Š by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age. The four school Houses are named after them: Godric Gryffindor, Helga \\nHufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar \\nSlytherin. They built this castle together, far \\nfrom prying Muggle eyes, for it was an age when \\nmagic was feared by common people, and witches and wizards suffered much persecution.ﬂ \\n \\n      He paused, gazed blearily around the room, and continued. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁFor a few years, the founders worked in harmony together, seeking out youngsters who showed signs of magic and bringing them to the castle to\\n be educated. But then disagreements sprang up \\nbetween them. A rift began to grow between Slytherin and the others. Slytherin wished to be \\nmore selective about the students admitted to Hogwar\\nts. He believed that magical learning \\nshould be kept within all-magic families. He \\ndisliked taking students of Muggle parentage, believing them to be untrustworthy. After a while,\\n there was a serious argument on the subject \\nbetween Slytherin and Gryffindor, and Slytherin left the school.ﬂ  \\n      Professor Binns paused again, pursing his lips, looking like a wrinkled old tortoise.        ﬁReliable historical sources tell us this much,ﬂ he said. ﬁBut th\\nese honest facts have been \\nobscured by the fanciful legend of the Chamber of\\n Secrets. The story goes that Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in the castle, of\\n which the other founders knew nothing.  \\n      ﬁSlytherin, according to the legend, sealed th\\ne Chamber of Secrets so that none would be able to \\nopen it until his own true heir arrived at the schoo\\nl. The heir alone would be able to unseal the \\nChamber of Secrets, unleash the \\nhorror within, and use it to purge the school of all who were unworthy to study magic.ﬂ \\n \\n      There was silence as he finished telling the story, but it wasn™t the usual, sleepy silence that filled Professor Binns™s classes. There was unease in the air as everyone continued to watch him, \\nhoping for more. Professor Binns looked faintly annoyed.  \\n      ﬁThe whole thing is arrant nonsense, of course,ﬂ he said. ﬁNaturally, the school has been searched for evidence of such a chamber, many \\ntimes, by the most learned witches and wizards. \\nIt does not exist. A tale told to frighten the gullible.ﬂ \\n \\n      Hermione™s hand was back in the air. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁSir Š what exactly do you mean by the ‚horror within™ the Chamber?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁThat is believed to be some sort of monste\\nr, which the Heir of Slytherin alone can control,ﬂ said Professor Binns in his dry, reedy voice.  \\n      The class exchanged nervous looks. \\n       ﬁI tell you, the thing does not exist,ﬂ said Professor Binns, shuffling his notes. ﬁThere is no Chamber and no monster.ﬂ \\n       ﬁBut, sir,ﬂ said Seamus Finnigan, ﬁif the \\nChamber can only be opened by Slytherin™s true heir, no one else would be able to find it, would they?ﬂ  \\n      ﬁNonsense, O™Flaherty,ﬂ said Professor Binns in an aggravated tone. ﬁIf a long succession of Hogwarts headmasters and headmist\\nresses haven™t found the thing Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁBut, Professor,ﬂ piped up Parvati Patil, ﬁyou™d probably have to use Dark Magic to open it Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁJust because a wizard doesn™t use Dark Magic doesn™t mean he \\ncan™t, Miss Pennyfeather,ﬂ snapped Professor Binns. ﬁI repeat, if the likes of Dumbledore Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁBut maybe you™ve got to be related to\\n Slytherin, so Dumbledore couldn™t Šﬂ began Dean \\nThomas, but Professor Binns had had enough. \\n \\n      ﬁThat will do,ﬂ he said sharply. ﬁIt is a myth\\n! It does not exist! There is not a shred of evidence that Slytherin ever built so much as a secret \\nbroom cupboard! I regret telling you such a foolish story! We will return, if you please, to \\nhistory, to solid, believable, verifiable fact\\n!ﬂ       And within five minutes, the \\nclass had sunk back into its usual torpor.    ﬁI always knew Salazar Slytherin was a twis\\nted old loony,ﬂ Ron told Harry and Hermione as \\nthey fought their way through the teeming corridors at\\n the end of the lesson to drop off their bags before dinner. ﬁBut I never knew he started all this pure-blood stuff. I wouldn™t be in his house if you paid me. Honestly, if the Sorting Hat had trie\\nd to put me in Slytherin, I™d™ve got the train \\nstraight back home–ﬂ \\n \\n      Hermione nodded fervently, but Harry di\\ndn™t say anything. His stomach had just dropped \\nunpleasantly.  \\n      Harry had never told Ron and Hermione th\\nat the Sorting Hat had seriously considered putting \\nhim in Slytherin. He could remember, as though \\nit were yesterday, the small voice that had \\nspoken in his ear when he™d placed the hat on his head a year before: You could be great, you know, it™s all here in your head, and Slytherin would help you on the way to greatness, no doubt \\nabout that–         But Harry, who had already heard of Slytherin House™s reputation for turning out Dark wizards, \\nhad thought desperately, Not Slytherin! and the hat had said, Oh, well, if you™re sure– better be Gryffindor–   \\n      As they were shunted along in the throng, Colin Creevy went past.  \\n      ﬁHiya, Harry!ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁHullo, Colin,ﬂ said Harry automatically. \\n \\n      ﬁHarry Š Harry Š a boy in my class has been saying you™re Šﬂ \\n \\n      But Colin was so small he couldn™t fight against the tide of people bearing him toward the Great \\nHall; they heard him squeak, ﬁSee you, Harry!ﬂ and he was gone. \\n \\n      ﬁWhat™s a boy in his class \\nsaying about you?ﬂ Hermione wondered. \\n \\n      ﬁThat I™m Slytherin™s heir, I expect,ﬂ said Harry, his stomach dropping a\\nnother inch or so as he suddenly remembered the way Justin Finch-Flet\\nchley had run away from him at lunchtime. \\n \\n      ﬁPeople here™ll believe anything,ﬂ said Ron in disgust.  \\n      The crowd thinned and they were able to climb the next staircase without difficulty.  \\n      ﬁD™you really think there™s a Chamber of \\nSecrets?ﬂ Ron asked Hermione. \\n \\n      ﬁI don™t know,ﬂ she said, frowning. ﬁDumbledor\\ne couldn™t cure Mrs. Norris, and that makes me \\nthink that whatever attacked her might not be Š well Š human.ﬂ \\n       As she spoke, they turned a corner and found themselves at the end of the very corridor where \\nthe attack had happened. They stopped and looked. The scene was just as it had been that night, except that there was no stiff cat hanging from the torch bracket, and an empty chair stood \\nagainst the wall bearing the message ﬁThe \\nChamber of Secrets has been Opened.ﬂ \\n       ﬁThat™s where Filch has been keeping guard,ﬂ Ron muttered. \\n \\n      They looked at each \\nother. The corridor was deserted.  \\n      ﬁCan™t hurt to have a poke around,ﬂ said Harry, dropping his bag and \\ngetting to his hands and knees so that he could crawl along, searching for clues.  \\n      ﬁScorch marks!ﬂ he\\n said. ﬁHere Š and here Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁCome and look at this!ﬂ said Hermione. ﬁThis is funny–ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      Harry got up and crossed to the window next to the message \\non the wall. Hermione was pointing \\nat the topmost pane, where around twenty spider\\ns were scuttling, apparently fighting to get through a small crack. A long, silvery thread was \\ndangling like a rope, as though they had all climbed it in their hurry to get outside. \\n \\n      ﬁHave you ever seen spiders act like that?ﬂ said Hermione wonderingly. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁNo,ﬂ said Harry, ﬁhave you, Ron? Ron?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      He looked over his shoulder. Ron was standing well back and seemed to be fighting the impulse \\nto run.  \\n      ﬁWhat™s up?ﬂ said Harry. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁI Š don™t Š like Š spiders,ﬂ said Ron tensely.  \\n      ﬁI never knew that,ﬂ said Hermione, looking at Ron in surprise\\n. ﬁYou™ve used spiders in Potions loads of times–ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁI don™t mind them dead,ﬂ said Ron, who \\nwas carefully looking anywhere but at the window. ﬁI just don™t like the way they move–ﬂ \\n \\n      Hermione giggled. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁIt™s not funny,ﬂ said Ron, fiercely. ﬁIf you must know, when I was three, Fred turned my Š my \\nteddy bear into a great big filthy spider becau\\nse I broke his toy broomstick– You wouldn™t like \\nthem either if you™d been holding your bear \\nand suddenly it had too many legs and–ﬂ \\n \\n      He broke off, shuddering. Hermione was \\nobviously still trying not to laugh. Feeling they had better get off the subject, Harry said, ﬁRemembe\\nr all that water on the floor? Where did that \\ncome from? Someone™s mopped it up.ﬂ \\n        ﬁIt was about here,ﬂ said Ron, recovering hims\\nelf to walk a few paces past Filch™s chair and pointing. ﬁLevel with this door.ﬂ  \\n      He reached for the brass doorknob but sudde\\nnly withdrew his hand as though he™d been burned. \\n \\n      ﬁWhat™s the matter?ﬂ said Harry. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁCan™t go in there,ﬂ said Ron gruffly. ﬁThat™s a girls™ toilet.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁOh, Ron, there won™t be anyone in there,ﬂ said Hermione standing up and coming over. ﬁThat™s \\nMoaning Myrtle™s place. Come on, let™s have a look.ﬂ \\n \\n      And ignoring the large OUT OF ORDER sign, she opened the door.  \\n      It was the gloomiest, most depressing bath\\nroom Harry had ever set foot in. Under a large, cracked, and spotted mirror were a row of chi\\npped sinks. The floor was damp and reflected the dull light given off by the stubs of a few candles\\n, burning low in their holders; the wooden doors \\nto the stalls were flaking and scratched a\\nnd one of them was dangling off its hinges. \\n \\n      Hermione put her fingers to her lips and se\\nt off toward the end stall.\\n When she reached it she \\nsaid, ﬁHello, Myrtle, how are you?ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry and Ron went to look. Moaning Myrtle was floating above the tank of the toilet, picking a spot on her chin.  \\n      ﬁThis is a girls™ bathroom,ﬂ she said, eyeing Ron and Harry suspiciously. ﬁ\\nThey™re not girls.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁNo,ﬂ Hermione agreed. \\nﬁI just wanted to show them \\nhow er Š nice it is in here.ﬂ  \\n      She waved vaguely at the dirty old mirror and the damp floor. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁAsk her if she saw anything,ﬂ Harry mouthed at Hermione. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁWhat are you whispering?ﬂ said Myrtle, staring at him. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁNothing,ﬂ said Harry quickly. ﬁWe wanted to ask Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁI wish people would stop talking behind my \\nback!ﬂ said Myrtle, in a voice choked with tears. ﬁI do have feelings, you know, even if I am dead Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁMyrtle, no one wants to upset you,ﬂ said Hermione. ﬁHarry only Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁNo one wants to upset me! That™s \\na good one!ﬂ howled Myrtle. ﬁMy life was nothing but misery at this place and now people come along ruining my death!ﬂ \\n      ﬁWe wanted to ask you if you™ve seen a\\nnything funny lately,ﬂ said Hermione quickly. ﬁBecause \\na cat was attacked right outside your front door on Halloween.ﬂ        ﬁDid you see anyone near here that night?ﬂ said Harry. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁI wasn™t paying attention,ﬂ said Myrtle dramatically. ﬁPeeve\\ns upset me so much I came in here \\nand tried to \\nkill myself. Then, of course, I reme\\nmbered that I™m Š that I™m Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁAlready dead,ﬂ said Ron helpfully. \\n \\n      Myrtle gave a tragic sob, rose up in the air, turned over, and dived headfirst into the toilet, splashing water all over them and vanishing \\nfrom sight, although from \\nthe direction of her muffled sobs, she had come to \\nrest somewhere in the U-bend. \\n \\n      Harry and Ron stood with their mouths open, but Hermione shr\\nugged wearily and said, ﬁHonestly, that was almost cheerful\\n for Myrtle– Come on, let™s go.ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry had barely closed the door on Myrtle™s gurgling sobs when a loud voice made all three of \\nthem jump. \\n \\n      ﬁRON!ﬂ \\n \\n      Percy Weasley had stopped dead at the head of the stairs, prefect badge agleam, an expression of \\ncomplete shock on his face. \\n \\n      ﬁThat™s a girls™ bathroom!ﬂ he gasped. ﬁWhat were \\nyou Š?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁJust having a look around,ﬂ Ron shrugged. ﬁClues, you know Šﬂ \\n \\n      Percy swelled in a manner that \\nreminded Harry forcefully of Mrs. Weasley. \\n \\n      ﬁGet Š away Š from Š there Šﬂ Perry said, striding toward them a\\nnd starting to bustle them along, flapping his arms. ﬁDon™t you \\ncare what this looks like? Coming back here while \\neveryone™s at dinner Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁWhy shouldn™t we be here?ﬂ said Ron ho\\ntly, stopping short and glaring at Percy. ﬁListen, we never laid a finger on that cat!ﬂ  \\n      ﬁThat™s what I told Ginny,ﬂ said Percy fiercely, ﬁbut she still seems to think you™re going to be \\nexpelled, I™ve never seen her so upset, crying her eyes out, you might think of \\nher, all the first \\nyears are thoroughly overexcited by this business Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁYou don™t care about Ginny,ﬂ said Ron, whose ears were now reddening. ﬁYou™re just worried \\nI™m going to mess up your chances of being Head Boy Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁFive points from Gryffindor!ﬂ Percy sa\\nid tersely, fingering his prefect badge. ﬁAnd I hope it \\nteaches you a lesson! No more \\ndetective work\\n, or I™ll write to Mum!ﬂ \\n       And he strode off, the back of his neck as red as Ron™s ears.    Harry, Ron, and Hermione chose seats as far as\\n possible from Percy in the common room that \\nnight. Ron was still in a very bad temper and kept blotting his Charms homework. When he \\nreached absently for his wand to remove the smudges, it ignited the parchment. Fuming almost \\nas much as his homework, Ron slammed \\nThe Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2 shut. To Harry™s surprise, Hermione followed suit. \\n \\n      ﬁWho can it be, though?ﬂ she said in a quiet\\n voice, as though continuing a conversation they had just been having. ﬁWho™d want to frighten all \\nthe Squibs and Muggle-borns out of Hogwart™s?ﬂ  \\n      ﬁLet™s think,ﬂ said Ron in mock puzzl\\nement. ﬁWho do we know who thinks Muggle-borns are \\nscum?ﬂ \\n \\n      He looked at Hermione. Hermione looked back, unconvinced. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁIf you™re talking about Malfoy Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁOf course I am!ﬂ said Ron. ﬁYou \\nheard him Š ‚You™ll be ne\\nxt, Mudbloods!™Š come on, \\nyou™ve only got to look at his foul rat face to know it™s him Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁMalfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?ﬂ said Hermione skeptically. \\n \\n      ﬁLook at his family,ﬂ said Harry, closing hi\\ns books, too. ﬁThe whole lot of them have been in \\nSlytherin; he™s always boasting about it. They could easily be Slytherin™s descendants. His \\nfather™s definitely evil enough.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁThey could™ve had the key to the Chamber of Secrets for centuries!ﬂ said Ron. ﬁHanding it down, father to son–ﬂ  \\n      ﬁWell,ﬂ said Hermione cautiously, ﬁI suppose it™s possible–ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁBut how do we prove it?ﬂ said Harry darkly. \\n \\n      ﬁThere might be a way,ﬂ said Hermione\\n slowly, dropping her voice still further with a quick glance across the room at Percy. ﬁOf course, \\nit would be difficult. And dangerous, very dangerous. We™d be breaking about fifty school rules, I expect Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁIf, in a month or so, you feel like e\\nxplaining, you will let us know, won™t you?ﬂ said Ron \\nirritably. \\n \\n      ﬁAll right,ﬂ said Hermione coldly. ﬁWhat we™d\\n need to do is to get inside the Slytherin common room and ask Malfoy a few questions without him realizing it™s us.ﬂ \\n       ﬁBut that™s impossible,ﬂ Harry said as Ron laughed. \\n       ﬁNo, it™s not,ﬂ said Hermione. ﬁAll we™d \\nneed would be some Polyjuice Potion.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWhat™s that?ﬂ said Ron and Harry together. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁSnape mentioned it in class a few weeks ago Šﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁD™you think we™ve got nothing better to do in Potions than listen to Snape?ﬂ muttered Ron. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁIt transforms you into somebody else. Thi\\nnk about it! We could change into three of the \\nSlytherins. No one would know it was us. Malfoy would probably tell us anything. He™s \\nprobably boasting about it in the Slytherin common room right now, \\nif only we could hear him.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁThis Polyjuice stuff sounds a bit dodgy to me,ﬂ said Ron, frowning. ﬁWhat if we were stuck \\nlooking like three of the Slytherins forever?ﬂ  \\n      ﬁIt wears off after a while,ﬂ said Hermi\\none, waving her hand impatien\\ntly. ﬁBut getting hold of the recipe will be very difficult. Snape said it \\nwas in a book called Moste Potente Potions and it™s \\nbound to be in the Restricted Section of the library.ﬂ There was only one way to get out a book \\nfrom the Restricted Section: You needed a sign\\ned note of permission from a teacher. ﬁHard to \\nsee why we™d want the book, really,ﬂ said Ron, ﬁif we weren™t going to try and make one of the \\n\\npotions.ﬂ ﬁI think,ﬂ said Hermione\\n, ﬁthat if we made it sound as though we were just interested in the theory, we might\\n stand a chance–   \\n      ﬁOh, come on, no teacher™s going to fall for th\\nat,ﬂ said Ron. ﬁThey™d have to be really thick–ﬂ  \\n          \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n CHAPTER TEN   The Rogue Bludger   \\n  Since the disastrous episode of the pixies, Professor Lockhart had not brought live creatures to class. Instead, he read passages from his books \\nto them, and sometimes reenacted some of the \\n\\nmore dramatic bits. He usually picked Harry to he\\nlp him with these reconstructions; so far, Harry \\nhad been forced to play a simple Transylvania\\nn villager whom Lockhart had cured of a Babbling Curse, a yeti with a head cold, and a vampire who \\nhad been unable to eat anything except lettuce since Lockhart had dealt with him. \\n \\n      Harry was hauled to the front of the class during their very next Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson, this time acting a werewolf. If he hadn™t \\nhad a very good reason for keeping Lockhart in a good mood, he would have refused to do it. \\n \\n      ﬁNice loud howl, Harry Š exactly Š and then, if you™ll believe it, I pounced Š like this Š slammed him to the floor Š thus with one hand\\n, I managed to hold him down Š with my other, \\nI put my wand to his throat Š I then screwe\\nd up my remaining strength and performed the \\nimmensely complex Homorphus Charm - he le\\nt out a piteous moan Š go on, Harry Š higher \\nthan that Š good Š the fur vanished Š the fangs shrank Š and he turned back into a man. \\nSimple, yet effective Š and another village will \\nremember me forever as the hero who delivered \\nthem from the monthly terror of werewolf attacks.ﬂ \\n \\n      The bell rang and Lockhart got to his feet.        ﬁHomework Š compose a poem about my de\\nfeat of the Wagga Wagga Werewolf! Signed copies \\nof Magical Me to the author of the best one!ﬂ        The class began to leave. Harry returned to the back of the room, where Ron and Hermione were \\nwaiting.  \\n      ﬁReady?ﬂ Harry muttered. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁWait till everyone™s gone,ﬂ \\nsaid Hermione nervously. ﬁAll right–ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      She approached Lockhart™s desk, a piece of\\n paper clutched tightly in her hand, Harry and Ron \\nright behind her.  \\n      ﬁEr Š Professor Lockhart?ﬂ Hermione stamme\\nred. ﬁI wanted to Š to get this book out of the library. Just for background reading.ﬂ She held ou\\nt the piece of paper, her hand shaking slightly. \\nﬁBut the thing is, it™s in the Rest\\nricted Section of the library, so I need a teacher to sign for it Š \\nI™m sure it would help me understand what you sa\\ny in Gadding with Ghouls about slow-acting venoms.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁAh, Gadding with Ghouls!ﬂ said Lockhart, taking the note from Hermione and smiling widely \\nat her. ﬁPossibly my very favorite book. You enjoyed it?ﬂ \\n       ﬁOh, yes,ﬂ said Hermione eagerly. ﬁSo clev\\ner, the way you trapped that last one with the tea-\\nstrainer Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWell, I™m sure no one will mind me giving the best student of the year a little extra help,ﬂ said \\nLockhart warmly, and he pulled out an enormous \\npeacock quill. ﬁYes, nice, isn™t it?ﬂ he said, \\nmisreading the revolted look on Ron™s face. \\nﬁI usually save it for book-signings.ﬂ \\n \\n      He scrawled an enormous loopy signatu\\nre on the note and handed it back to Hermione. \\n \\n      ﬁSo, Harry,ﬂ said Lockhart, while Hermione \\nfolded the note with fumbling fingers and slipped it \\ninto her bag. ﬁTomorrow™s the first Quidditch ma\\ntch of the season, I believe? Gryffindor against \\nSlytherin, is it not? I hear you™re a useful player. I was a Seeker, too. I was asked to try for the National Squad, but preferred to dedicate my life to \\nthe eradication of the Dark Forces. Still, if \\never you feel the need for a little private training, don™t hesitate to ask. Always happy to pass on my expertise to less able players–ﬂ  \\n      Harry made an indistinct noise in his throat and then hurried off after Ron and Hermione. \\n \\n      ﬁI don™t believe it,ﬂ he said as the three of them examined \\nthe signature on the note. ﬁHe didn™t even look at the book we wanted.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁThat™s because he™s a brainless git,ﬂ sa\\nid Ron. ﬁBut who cares, we™ve got what we neededŠﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁHe is not a brainless git,ﬂ said Hermi\\none shrilly as they half ran toward the library. \\n \\n      ﬁJust because he said you were the best student of the year Šﬂ \\n \\n      They dropped their voices as they entered the muffled stillness of the \\nlibrary. Madam Pince, the \\nlibrarian, was a thin, irritable woma\\nn who looked like an underfed vulture.  \\n      ﬁMoste Potente Potions?ﬂ she repeated suspiciously, trying to take the note from Hermione; but \\nHermione wouldn™t let go. \\n \\n      ﬁI was wondering if I could keep it,ﬂ she said breathlessly.  \\n      ﬁOh, come on,ﬂ said Ron, wrenching it from \\nher grasp and thrusting it at Madam Pince. ﬁWe™ll \\nget you another autograph. Lockhart™ll sign anything if it stands still long enough.ﬂ  \\n      Madam Pince held the note up to the light, as\\n though determined to detect a forgery, but it passed \\nthe test. She stalked away between the lofty shel\\nves and returned several minutes later carrying a \\nlarge and moldy-looking book. Hermione put it carefu\\nlly into her bag and they left, trying not to walk too quickly or look too guilty.  \\n      Five minutes later, they were barricaded \\nin Moaning Myrtle™s out-of-order bathroom once again. Hermione had overridden Ron™s objections by pointi\\nng out that it was the last place anyone in their right minds would go, so they were guaranteed some privacy. Moaning Myrtle was crying \\nnoisily in her stall, but they \\nwere ignoring her, and she them. \\n       Hermione opened Moste Potente Potions ca\\nrefully, and the three of them bent over the damp-\\nspotted pages. It was clear from a glance why it \\nbelonged in the Restricted Section. Some of the \\npotions had effects almost too gruesome to th\\nink about, and there were some very unpleasant \\nillustrations, which included a man who seemed to\\n have been turned inside out and a witch \\nsprouting several extra pairs \\nof arms out of her head. \\n \\n      ﬁHere it is,ﬂ said Hermione excitedly as she found the page headed \\nThe Polyjuice Potion\\n. It was decorated with drawings of people halfway through transforming into other people. Harry \\nsincerely hoped the artist had imagined \\nthe looks of intense pain on their faces. \\n \\n      ﬁThis is the most complicated potion I™ve ev\\ner seen,ﬂ said Hermione as they scanned the recipe. \\nﬁLacewing flies, leeches, fluxweed, and knotgrass,\\nﬂ she murmured, running her finger down the \\nlist of ingredients. ﬁWell, they™re easy enough, they\\n™re in the student store-cupboard, we can help ourselves– Oooh, look, powdered horn of a bicorn Š don™t know where we™re going to get that Š shredded skin of a boomslang Š that™ll be tricky, \\ntoo and of course a bit of whoever we want to change into.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁExcuse me?ﬂ said Ron sharply. ﬁWhat d™\\nyou mean, a bit of whoeve\\nr we™re changing into? I™m \\ndrinking nothing with Crabbe™s toenails in it Šﬂ \\n \\n      Hermione continued as though she hadn™t heard him. \\n\\n       ﬁWe don™t have to worry about that \\nyet, though, because we add those bits last–ﬂ \\n       Ron turned, speechless, to Harry, who had another worry. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁD™you realize how much we™re going to have to steal, Hermione? Shredded skin of a \\nboomslang, that™s definitely not \\nin the students™ cupboard. What™re we going to do, break into Snape™s private stores? I don™t know if this is a good idea–ﬂ  \\n      Hermione shut the book with a snap. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁWell, if you two are going to chicken out, fi\\nne,ﬂ she said. There were bright pink patches on her cheeks and her eyes were brighter than usual. ﬁI don™t want to break rules, you know. I think threatening Muggle-borns is far worse than brewing up a difficult potion. But if you don™t want to find out if it™s Malfoy, I™l\\nl go straight to Madam Pince now and hand the book back in.™  \\n      ﬁI never thought I™d see the day when you™d \\nbe persuading us to break rules,ﬂ said Ron. ﬁAll right, we™ll do it. But not toenails, okay?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁHow long will it take to make, anyway?ﬂ\\n said Harry as Hermione, looking happier, opened the \\nbook again.       ﬁWell, since the fluxweed has got to be pick\\ned at the full moon and the lacewings have got to be \\nstewed for twenty-one days– I™d say it™d be ready in about a month, if\\n we can get all the ingredients.ﬂ        ﬁA month?ﬂ said Ron. ﬁMalfoy could have\\n attacked half the Muggle-borns in the school by then!ﬂ But Hermione™s eyes narrowed dangerously\\n again, and he added swiftly, ﬁBut it™s the best plan we™ve got, so full steam ahead, I say.ﬂ \\n \\n      However, while Hermione was checking that \\nthe coast was clear for them to leave the bathroom, \\nRon muttered to Harry, ﬁIt™ll be a lot less hass\\nle if you can just knock Malfoy off his broom \\ntomorrow.ﬂ \\n \\n  Harry woke early on Saturday morning and la\\ny for a while thinking about the coming Quidditch \\nmatch. He was nervous, mainly at the thought of\\n what Wood would say if\\n Gryffindor lost, but also at the idea of facing a team mounted on the fastest racing\\n brooms gold could buy. He had \\nnever wanted to beat Slytherin so badly. After \\nhalf an hour of lying there with his insides churning, he got up, dressed, and went down to breakfast early, where he found the rest of the Gryffindor team huddled at the long, empty tabl\\ne, all looking uptight and not speaking much. \\n \\n      As eleven o™clock approached, the whole school started to make its way down to the Quidditch \\nstadium. It was a muggy sort of day with a hi\\nnt of thunder in the air. Ron and Hermione came \\nhurrying over to wish Harry good luck as he ente\\nred the locker rooms. The team pulled on their \\nscarlet Gryffindor robes, then sat down to listen to Wood™s usual pre-match pep talk. \\n \\n      ﬁSlytherin has better brooms than us,ﬂ \\nhe began. ﬁNo point denying it. But we™ve got better people on our brooms. We™ve trained harder than th\\ney have, we™ve been flying in all weathers Šﬂ(ﬁToo true,ﬂ muttered George Weasley. ﬁI have\\nn™t been properly dry since Augustﬂ) ﬁŠ and we™re going to make them rue the \\nday they let that little bit of slime, Malfoy, buy his way onto \\ntheir team.ﬂ \\n \\n      Chest heaving with emotion, Wood turned to Harry. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁIt™ll be down to you, Harry, to show them that\\n a Seeker has to have something more than a rich \\nfather. Get to that Snitch before Malfoy or \\ndie trying, Harry, because we™ve got to win today, \\nwe™ve got to.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁSo no pressure, Harryﬂ said Fred, winking at him. \\n\\n \\n      As they walked out onto the pitch, a ro\\nar of noise greeted them; mainly cheers, because \\nRavenclaw and Hufflepuff we\\nre anxious to see Slytherin beaten, but the Slytherins in the crowd \\nmade their boos and hisses heard, too. Madam \\nHooch, the Quidditch teacher, asked Flint and \\nWood to shake hands, which they did, giving each other threatening stares and gripping rather harder than was necessary.  \\n      ﬁOn my whistle,ﬂ said\\n Madam Hooch. ﬁThree– two– one–ﬂ \\n       With a roar from the crowd to speed them\\n upward, the fourteen players rose toward the leaden sky. Harry flew higher than any of them, squinting around for the Snitch. \\n       ﬁAll right there, Scarhead?ﬂ yelled Malfoy, shooting underneat\\nh him as though to show off the \\nspeed of his broom. \\n \\n      Harry had no time to reply. At that very moment, a heavy black Bludger came pelting toward \\nhim; he avoided it so narrowly that he\\n felt it ruffle his hair as it passed.  \\n      ﬁClose one, Harry!ﬂ said George, streaking past him with his club in\\n his hand, ready to knock the Bludger back toward a Slytherin. Harry saw Geor\\nge give the Bludger a powerful whack in the direction of Adrian Pucey, but the Bludger changed direction in midair \\nand shot straight for Harry again.  \\n      Harry dropped quickly to avoid it, and George managed to hit it hard toward Malfoy. Once \\nagain, the Bludger swerved like a boomerang and s\\nhot at Harry™s head.  \\n      Harry put on a burst of speed and zoomed to\\nward the other end of the pitch. He could hear the Bludger whistling along behind him.\\n What was going on? Bludgers never concentrated on one \\nplayer like this; it was their job to try \\nand unseat as many people as possible–  \\n \\n      Fred Weasley was waiting for the Bludger \\nat the other end. Harry ducked as Fred swung at the Bludger with all his might; the Bludger was knocked off course. \\n \\n      ﬁGotcha!ﬂ Fred yelled happily, but he was wrong; as though it was ma\\ngnetically attracted to Harry, the Bludger pelted after him once more and Harry was forced to fly off at full speed. \\n \\n      It had started to rain; Harry felt heavy drops\\n fall onto his face, splattering onto his glasses. He \\ndidn™t have a clue what was going \\non in the rest of the game until he heard Lee Jordan, who was \\ncommentating, say, ﬁSlytherin lead, sixty points to zero.™  \\n      The Slytherins™ superior brooms were cl\\nearly doing their jobs, and meanwhile the mad Bludger \\nwas doing all it could to knock Harry out of the air. Fred and George were now flying so close to him on either side that Harry co\\nuld see nothing at all except their flailing arms and had no chance \\nto look for the Snitch, let alone catch it.  \\n      ﬁSomeone™s Š tampered Š with Š this \\nŠ Bludger Šﬂ Fred grunted, swinging his bat with all his might at it as it launc\\nhed a new attack on Harry.  \\n      ﬁWe need time out,ﬂ said George, tryi\\nng to signal to Wood a\\nnd stop the Bludger breaking Harry™s nose at the same time. \\n \\n      Wood had obviously got the message. Mada\\nm Hooch™s whistle rang out and Harry, Fred, and George dived for the ground, still trying to avoid the mad Bludger. \\n \\n      ﬁWhat™s going on?ﬂ said Wood as the Gryffi\\nndor team huddled together, \\nwhile Slytherins in the \\ncrowd jeered. ﬁWe™re being flattened. Fred, Ge\\norge, where were you when that Bludger stopped Angelina scoring?ﬂ \\n       ﬁWe were twenty feet above her, stopping th\\ne other Bludger from murder\\ning Harry, Oliver,ﬂ said George angrily. ﬁSomeone™s fixed \\nit Š it won™t leave Harry alone. It hasn™t gone for anyone else all game. The Slytherins must \\nhave done something to it.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁBut the Bludgers have been locked in Madam Hooch™s office since our last practice, and there was nothing wrong with them then–ﬂ said \\nWood, anxiously. Madam Hooch was walking \\ntoward them. Over her shoulder, Harry could see \\nthe Slytherin team jeering and pointing in his \\ndirection.  \\n      ﬁListen,ﬂ said Harry as she came nearer \\nand nearer, ﬁwith you two flying around me all the time \\nthe only way I™m going to catch the Sn\\nitch is if it flies up my sleeve.\\n Go back to the rest of the team and let me deal with the rogue one.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁDon™t be thick,ﬂ said Fred. ﬁIt™ll take your head off.ﬂ \\n \\n      Wood was looking from Harry to the Weasleys. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁOliver, this is insane,ﬂ said Alicia Spinner angrily. ﬁYou can™t let Harry deal with that thing on \\nhis own. Let™s ask for an inquiry–ﬂ  \\n      ﬁIf we stop now, we™ll have to forfeit the match!ﬂ said Harry. ﬁAnd we™re\\n not losing to Slytherin just because of a crazy Bludger! Come on, O\\nliver, tell them to leave me alone!ﬂ \\n       ﬁThis is all your fault,ﬂ George said angrily to Wood. ﬁ‚Get the Snitc\\nh or die trying,™ what a stupid thing to tell him Šﬂ \\n       Madam Hooch had joined them. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁReady to resume play?ﬂ she asked Wood. \\n\\n \\n      Wood looked at the determined look on Harry™s face. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁAll right,ﬂ he said. ﬁFred, George, you heard Harry Š leave him alone and let him deal with the \\nBludger on his own.ﬂ  \\n      The rain was falling more heavily now. On Madam Hooch™s whistle, Harry kicked hard into the \\nair and heard the telltale whoosh of the Bludger behind him.\\n Higher and higher Harry climbed; \\nhe looped and swooped, spiraled, zigzagged, and rolled. Slightly dizzy, he nevertheless kept his eyes wide open, rain was speckling his glasses and ran up his nostrils as he hung upside down, avoiding another fierce dive from the Bludger. He could hear laughter from the crowd; he knew \\nhe must look very stupid, but the rogue Bludge\\nr was heavy and couldn™t change direction as \\nquickly as Harry could; he began a kind of roller-coaster ride around the edges of the stadium, \\nsquinting through the silver sheets of rain to the Gryffindor goal posts, where Adrian Pucey was \\ntrying to get past Wood. \\n       A whistling in Harry™s ear told him the Bludger had just missed him again; he turned right over \\nand sped in the opposite direction.  \\n      ﬁTraining for the ballet, Potter?ﬂ yelled Malfoy as Harry was \\nforced to do a stupid kind of twirl in midair to dodge the Bludger, and he fled, the \\nBludger trailing a few feet behind him; and then, \\nglaring back at Malfoy in hatred, he saw it Š the Golden Snitch. It was hovering inches above Malfoy™s left ear Š and Malfoy, busy \\nlaughing at Harry, hadn™t seen it.  \\n      For an agonizing moment, Harry hung in mida\\nir, not daring to speed toward Malfoy in case he looked up and saw the Snitch.  \\n      WHAM. \\n\\n \\n      He had stayed still a second too long. The Bludger had hit him \\nat last, smashed into his elbow, \\nand Harry felt his arm break. Dimly, dazed by the sear\\ning pain in his arm, he slid sideways on his \\nrain-drenched broom, one knee stil\\nl crooked over it, his right arm da\\nngling useless at his side Š the Bludger came pelting back for a second attac\\nk, this time zooming at his face Š Harry \\nswerved out of the way, one idea firmly \\nlodged in his numb brain: get to Malfoy. \\n \\n      Through a haze of rain and pain he dived for the shimmering, sneering face below him and saw \\nits eyes widen with fear: Malfoy thought Harry was attacking him. \\n \\n      ﬁWhat the Šﬂ he gasped, careening out of Harry™s way. \\n\\n       Harry took his remaining hand off his broom \\nand made a wild snatch; he felt his fingers close on \\nthe cold Snitch but was now only gripping the broom with his legs, and ther\\ne was a yell from the \\ncrowd below as he headed straight for the ground, trying hard not to pass out.        With a splattering thud he hit the mud a\\nnd rolled off his broom. His arm was hanging at a very \\nstrange angle; riddled with pain, he heard, as though from a dist\\nance, a good deal of whistling and shouting. He focused on the Snitch clutched in his good hand.  \\n      ﬁAha,ﬂ he said vaguely. ﬁWe™ve won.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      And he fainted. \\n \\n      He came around, rain falling on his face, still lying on the field, with someone leaning over him. \\nHe saw a glitter of teeth.  \\n      ﬁOh, no, not you,ﬂ he moaned. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁDoesn™t know what he™s saying,ﬂ said Lockhart loudly to the anxious crowd of Gryffindors pressing around them. ﬁNot to worry, \\nHarry. I™m about to fix your arm.ﬂ \\n      ﬁNo!ﬂ said Harry. ﬁI™ll keep it like this, thanks–ﬂ \\n      He tried to sit up, but the pain was terrible. He heard a familiar clicking noise nearby. \\n \\n      ﬁI don™t want a photo of this, Colin,ﬂ he said loudly.  \\n      ﬁLie back, Harry,ﬂ said Lockhart soothingly. ﬁIt™s a simple charm I™ve used countless times Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWhy can™t I just go to the hospita\\nl wing?ﬂ said Harry \\nthrough clenched teeth.  \\n      ﬁHe should really, Professor,ﬂ said a \\nmuddy Wood, who couldn™t help\\n grinning even though his Seeker was injured. ﬁGreat capture, Harry, really spectacular, your best yet, I™d say Šﬂ  \\n      Through the thicket of legs around him, Ha\\nrry spotted Fred and George Weasley, wrestling the \\nrogue Bludger into a box. It was \\nstill putting up a terrific fight. \\n \\n      ﬁStand back,ﬂ said Lockhart, who was rolling up his jade-green sleeves.  \\n      ﬁNo Š don™t Šﬂ said Harry weakly, but Lockhart was twirling his wand and a second later had directed it straight at Harry™s arm. \\n \\n      A strange and unpleasant sensation started at Harry™s shoulder and spread all the way down to his fingertips. It felt as though his arm was being deflated. He didn™t dare look at what was \\nhappening. He had shut his eyes, his face turned \\naway from his arm, but his worst fears were \\nrealized as the people above him gasped and Co\\nlin Creevey began clicking away madly. His arm \\ndidn™t hurt anymore Š nor did it feel remotely like an arm. \\n \\n      ﬁAh,ﬂ said Lockhart. ﬁYes. Well, that ca\\nn sometimes happen. But the \\npoint is, the bones are no longer broken. That™s the thing to bear in mi\\nnd. So, Harry, just toddle up to the hospital wing Š ah, Mr. Weasley, Miss Granger, would you escort \\nhim? Š and Madam Pomfrey will be able to \\nŠ er Š tidy you up a bit.ﬂ  \\n      As Harry got to his feet, he felt strangely lopsided. Taking a deep breath he looked down at his right side. What he saw nearly made him pass out again. \\n \\n      Poking out of the end of his robes was what looked like a thick, flesh-colored rubber glove. He tried to move his fingers. Nothing happened. \\n \\n      Lockhart hadn™t mended Harry™s bones. He had removed them. \\n\\n \\n      Madam Pomfrey wasn™t at all pleased. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁYou should have come straight to me!ﬂ \\nshe raged, holding up the sad, limp remainder of what, \\nhalf an hour before, had been a working arm.\\n ﬁI can mend bones in a second Š but growing \\nthem back Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁYou will be able to, won™t you?ﬂ said Harry desperately. \\n\\n       ﬁI™ll be able to, certainly, but it will be painful,ﬂ said Madam Pomf\\nrey grimly, throwing Harry a \\npair of pajamas. ﬁYou™ll have to stay the night–ﬂ \\n       Hermione waited outside the curtain draw\\nn around Harry™s bed while Ron helped him into his \\npajamas. It took a while to stuff th\\ne rubbery, boneless arm into a sleeve. \\n \\n      ﬁHow can you stick up for Lockhart now, Hermione, eh?ﬂ Ron called through the curtain as he \\npulled Harry™s limp fingers through the cuff. ﬁI\\nf Harry had wanted deboning he would have asked.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁAnyone can make a mistake,ﬂ said Hermione. ﬁAnd it doesn™t hurt \\nanymore, does it, Harry?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁNo,ﬂ said Harry, getting into bed. ﬁBut it doesn™t do anything else either.ﬂ  \\n      As he swung himself onto the bed, his arm flapped pointlessly. \\n\\n \\n      Hermione and Madam Pomfrey came around \\nthe curtain. Madam Pomfrey was holding a large \\nbottle of something labeled Skele-Gro. \\n \\n      ﬁYou™re in for a rough night,ﬂ she said, pouring out a steaming beaker\\nful and handing it to him. \\nﬁRegrowing bones is a nasty business.ﬂ  \\n      So was taking the Skele-Gro. It burned Harry™s mouth and throat \\nas it went down, making him \\ncough and splutter. Still tut-tutti\\nng about dangerous sports and inept teachers, Madam Pomfrey retreated, leaving Ron and Hermione to help Harry gulp down some water. ﬁWe won, though,ﬂ \\n\\nsaid Ron, a grin breaking across his face. ﬁT\\nhat was some catch you made. Malfoy™s face– he \\nlooked ready to kill–ﬂ  \\n      ﬁI want to know how he fixed that Bludger,ﬂ said Hermione darkly.  \\n ﬁWe can add that to the list of questions we™ll \\nask him when we™ve taken the Polyjuice Potion,ﬂ \\nsaid Harry, sinking back onto his pillows. ﬁI hope it tastes better than this stuff–ﬂ  \\n      ﬁIf it™s got bits of Slytherins in it? You™ve got to be\\n joking,ﬂ said Ron.  \\n      The door of the hospital wing burst open at th\\nat moment. Filthy and soaking wet, the rest of the \\nGryffindor team had arrived to see Harry. ﬁUnbeliev\\nable flying, Harry,ﬂ said George. ﬁI™ve just seen Marcus Flint yelling at Malfoy. Something about having the \\nSnitch on top of his head and not noticing. Malfoy didn™t seem too happy.ﬂ Th\\ney had brought cakes, sweets, and bottles of pumpkin juice; they gathered ar\\nound Harry™s bed and were just getting started on what promised \\nto be a good party when Madam Pomfrey came \\nstorming over, shouting, ﬁThis boy needs rest, \\nhe™s got thirty-three bones to regrow! Out! OUT!ﬂ And Harry was left alone, with nothing to distract him from the stabbi\\nng pains in his limp arm. \\n \\n      Hours and hours later, Harry woke quite suddenly in the pitch blackness and gave a small yelp of \\npain: His arm now felt full of large splinters. For a second, he thought that was what had woken him. Then, with a thrill of ho\\nrror, he realized that someone \\nwas sponging his forehead in the dark.        ﬁGet off!ﬂ he said loudly, and then, ﬁDobby!ﬂ  \\n      The house-elf™s goggling tennis ball eyes were peering at Harry through the darkness. A single tear was running down his long, pointed nose.  \\n      ﬁHarry Potter came back to school,ﬂ he \\nwhispered miserably. ﬁDobby warned and warned Harry \\nPotter. Ah sir, why didn™t you heed Dobby? Wh\\ny didn™t Harry Potter go back home when he \\nmissed the train?ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry heaved himself up on his pillows and pushed Dobby™s sponge away. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁWhat™re you doing here?ﬂ he sa\\nid. ﬁAnd how did you know I missed the train?ﬂ \\n \\n      Dobby™s lip trembled and Harry was seized by a sudden suspicion. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁIt was you!ﬂ he said slowly. ﬁY\\nou stopped the barrier from letting us through!ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁIndeed yes, sir,ﬂ said Dobby, nodding his head vigorously, ears flapping. ﬁDobby hid and watched for Harry Potter and sealed the gateway and Dobby had to iron his hands afterwardﬂ Š \\nhe showed Harry ten long, bandaged fingers Š ﬁbut Dobby didn™t care, sir, for he thought Harry Potter was safe, and never did Dobby dream that \\nHarry Potter would get to school another way!ﬂ  \\n      He was rocking backward and forward, shaking his ugly head.        ﬁDobby was so shocked when he heard Harry Potter was back at Hogwarts, he let his master™s \\ndinner burn! Such a flogging Dobby never had, sir–ﬂ  \\n      Harry slumped back onto his pillows. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁYou nearly got Ron and me expelled,ﬂ he \\nsaid fiercely. ﬁYou™d better get lost before my bones \\ncome back, Dobby, or I might strangle you.ﬂ \\n \\n      Dobby smiled weakly. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁDobby is used to death threats, sir. Dobby gets them five times a day at home.ﬂ \\n \\n      He blew his nose on a corner of the filthy pillowcase he wore, looking so pathetic that Harry felt \\nhis anger ebb away in spite of himself. \\n \\n      ﬁWhy d™you wear that \\nthing, Dobby?ﬂ he asked curiously. \\n \\n      ﬁThis, sir?ﬂ said Dobby, plucking at the pi\\nllowcase. ﬁ‚Tis a mark of the house-elf™s enslavement, \\nsir. Dobby can only be freed if his masters present him with clothes, sir. Th\\ne family is careful not \\nto pass Dobby even a sock, sir, for then he would be free to leave their house forever.ﬂ        Dobby mopped his bulging eyes and said suddenly, ﬁHarry Potter must go home! Dobby thought \\nhis Bludger would be enough to make Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁYour Bludger?ﬂ said Harry, anger rising once more. ﬁWhat d™you mean, your Bludger? You \\nmade that Bludger try and kill me?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁNot kill you, sir, never kill you!ﬂ said Dobby, shocked. ﬁDobby wants to save Harry Potter™s life! Better sent home, grievously injured, than \\nremain here sir! Dobby only wanted Harry Potter \\nhurt enough to be sent home!ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁOh, is that all?ﬂ said Harry angrily. \\nﬁI don™t suppose you™re going to tell me why you wanted \\nme sent home in pieces?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁAh, if Harry Potter only knew!ﬂ Dobby groaned, more tears dripping onto his ragged \\npillowcase. ﬁIf he knew what he means to us, to \\nthe lowly, the enslaved, we dregs of the magical \\nworld! Dobby remembers how it was when He-Who-\\nMust-Not-Be-Named was at the height of \\nhis powers, sir! We house-elves we\\nre treated like vermin, sir! Of\\n course, Dobby is still treated like that, sir,ﬂ he admitted, drying his face on the p\\nillowcase. ﬁBut mostly, sir, life has improved \\nfor my kind since you triumphed over He-Who-Must\\n-Not-Be-Named. Harry Potter survived, and \\nthe Dark Lord™s power was broken, and it was a new dawn, sir, and Harry Potter shone like a beacon of hope for those of us who thought the Dark days would never end, sit– And now, at Hogwarts, terrible things are to happen, are perhaps happening already, and Dobby cannot let Harry Potter stay here now that history is to repeat itself, now that the Chamber of Secrets is open once more.ﬂ  \\n      Dobby froze, horrorstruck, then grabbed Harry™s water jug from his be\\ndside table and cracked it over his own head, toppling out of sight. A second\\n later, he crawled back onto the bed, cross-eyed, muttering, ﬁBad Dobby, very bad Dobby–ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁSo there is a Chamber of Secrets?ﬂ Harry whispered. ﬁAnd did you say it™s been opened before? \\nTell me, Dobby!ﬂ \\n \\n      He seized the elf™s bony wrist as Dobby™s hand inched toward the water jug. ﬁBut I™m not \\nMuggle-born Š how can I be in danger from the Chamber?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁAh, sir, ask no more, ask no more of poor D\\nobby,ﬂ stammered the elf, his eyes huge in the dark. \\nﬁDark deeds are planned in this place, but Harry Potter must not be here when they happen Š go \\nhome, Harry Potter, go home. Harry Potter must not\\n meddle in this, sir, ‚tis too dangerous Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWho is it, Dobby?ﬂ Harry said, keeping \\na firm hold on Dobby™s wrist to stop him from hitting \\nhimself with the water jug again. ﬁWho™\\ns opened it? Who opened it last time?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁDobby can™t, sir, Dobby can™t, Dobby mustn™t te\\nll!ﬂ squealed the elf. \\nﬁGo home, Harry Potter, \\ngo home!ﬂ \\n      ﬁI™m not going anywhere!ﬂ \\nsaid Harry fiercely. ﬁOne of my best friends is Muggle-born; she™ll be first in line if the Chambe\\nr really has been opened Šﬂ        ﬁHarry Potter risks his own life for his fr\\niends!ﬂ moaned Dobby in a \\nkind of miserable ecstasy. \\nﬁSo noble! So valiant! But he must save himself, he must, Harry Potter must not Šﬂ \\n \\n      Dobby suddenly froze, his bat ears quivering. Harry heard it, too. There were footsteps coming \\ndown the passageway outside.  \\n      ﬁDobby must go!ﬂ breathed the elf, terrified. There was a loud crack, and Harry™s fist was suddenly clenched on thin air. He slumped back into bed, his eyes on the dark doorway to the hospital wing as the footsteps drew nearer.  \\n      Next moment, Dumbledore was backing in\\nto the dormitory, wearing a long woolly dressing \\ngown and a nightcap. He was carrying one end of what looked like a statue. Professor McGonagall appeared a second later, carrying its feet. Together, they heaved it onto a bed.  \\n      ﬁGet Madam Pomfrey,ﬂ \\nwhispered Dumbledore, and Professor McGonagall hurrie\\nd past the end of Harry™s bed out of sight. Harry lay quite still, pretending to be asleep. He heard urgent voices, and then Professor McGonagall swept back into view, closely followed by Madam Pomfrey, \\nwho was pulling a cardigan on over her nightdress. He heard a sharp intake of breath.  \\n      ﬁWhat happened?ﬂ Madam Pomfrey whispere\\nd to Dumbledore, bending over the statue on the bed.  \\n      ﬁAnother attack,ﬂ said Dumble\\ndore. ﬁMinerva found him on the stairs.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁThere was a bunch of grapes next to him,\\nﬂ said Professor McGonagall. ﬁWe think he was trying \\nto sneak up here to visit Potter.ﬂ  \\n      Harry™s stomach gave a hor\\nrible lurch. Slowly and carefully, he raised himself a few inches so he \\ncould look at the statue on the bed. A ray \\nof moonlight lay acro\\nss its staring face.  \\n      It was Colin Creevey. His eyes were wide and his hands were stuck up in front of him, holding \\nhis camera. \\n \\n      ﬁPetrified?ﬂ whispered Madam Pomfrey. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁYes,ﬂ said Professor McGonagall. ﬁBut I shudder to think– If Albus hadn™t been on the way downstairs for hot chocolate Š \\nwho knows what might have Šﬂ \\n \\n      The three of them stared down at Colin. Then Dumbledore leaned forward and wrenched the \\ncamera out of Colin™s rigid grip. \\n \\n      ﬁYou don™t think he managed to get a pict\\nure of his attacker?ﬂ said Professor McGonagall \\neagerly.       Dumbledore didn™t answer. He opened the back of the camera. \\n \\n      ﬁGood gracious!ﬂ said Madam Pomfrey. \\n\\n \\n      A jet of steam had hissed out of the camer\\na. Harry, three beds away, caught the acrid smell of \\nburnt plastic.  \\n      ﬁMelted,ﬂ said Madam Pomfrey wonderingly. ﬁAll melted–ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁWhat does this mean, Albus\\n?ﬂ Professor McGonagall asked urgently.  \\n      ﬁIt means,ﬂ said Dumbledore, ﬁthat \\nthe Chamber of Secrets is indeed open again.ﬂ \\n \\n      Madam Pomfrey clapped a hand to her m\\nouth. Professor McGonagall stared at Dumbledore. \\n \\n      ﬁBut, Albus– surely– who?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁThe question is not who,ﬂ said Dumbledore, his eyes on \\nColin. ﬁThe question is, how–ﬂ And from what Harry could see of Professor McGona\\ngall™s shadowy face, she didn™t understand this \\nany better than he did.  \\n          \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n CHAPTER ELEVEN \\n  The Dueling Club     Harry woke up on Sunday morning to find the do\\nrmitory blazing with winter sunlight and his \\narm reboned but very stiff. He sat up quickly \\nand looked over at Colin™s bed, but it had been blocked from view by the high curtains Harry had changed behind yesterday. Seeing that he was awake, Madam Pomfrey came bustli\\nng over with a breakfast tray and then began bending and stretching his arm and fingers. \\n \\n      ﬁAll in order,ﬂ she said as he clumsily \\nfed himself porridge left-han\\nded. ﬁWhen you™ve finished \\neating, you may leave.ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry dressed as quickly as he could and hurried off to Gryffindor Tower, desperate to tell Ron and Hermione about Colin and Dobby, but they we\\nren™t there. Harry left to look for them, \\nwondering where they could have got to and feeling slightly hurt that they weren™t interested in whether he had his bones back or not.  \\n      As Harry passed the library, Percy Weasley stroll\\ned out of it, looking in far better spirits than last time they™d met. \\n \\n      ﬁOh, hello, Harry,ﬂ he said. ﬁExcellent flying yesterday, really excellent. Gryffindor has just taken the lead for the House Cup Š you earned fifty points!ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁYou haven™t seen Ron or Hermione, have you?ﬂ said Harry. \\n \\n      ﬁNo, I haven™t,ﬂ said Percy, his smile fa\\nding. ﬁI hope Ron™s not in another girls™ toilet–ﬂ  \\n      Harry forced a laugh, watched Percy walk out of sight, and then headed straight for Moaning \\nMyrtle™s bathroom. He couldn™t \\nsee why Ron and Hermione would \\nbe in there again, but after making sure that neither Filch \\nnor any prefects were around, he \\nopened the door and heard their voices coming from a locked stall. \\n \\n      ﬁIt™s me,ﬂ he said, closing the door be\\nhind him. There was a clunk, a splash, and a gasp from \\nwithin the stall and he saw Hermi\\none™s eye peering through the keyhole.  \\n      ﬁHarry!ﬂ she said. ﬁYou gave us \\nsuch a fright Š come in. How™s your arm?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁFine,ﬂ said Harry, squeezing into the sta\\nll. An old cauldron was perched on the toilet, and a \\ncrackling from under the rim told Harry they had \\nlit a fire beneath it. Conjuring up portable, \\nwaterproof fires was a speciality of Hermione™s. \\n \\n      ﬁWe™d™ve come to meet you, but we d\\necided to get started on the Polyjuice Potion,ﬂ Ron explained as Harry, with difficulty, locked the stall again. ﬁWe™ve decided this is the safest place \\nto hide it.ﬂ       Harry started to tell them \\nabout Colin, but Hermione interrupted. \\n       ﬁWe already know Š we heard Professor Mc\\nGonagall telling Professor Flitwick this morning. \\nThat™s why we decided we™d better get going Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁThe sooner we get a confession out of Malfoy, the better,ﬂ snarled Ron. ﬁD™you know what I \\nthink? He was in such a foul temper after \\nthe Quidditch match, he took it out on Colin.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁThere™s something else,ﬂ said Harry, \\nwatching Hermione teari\\nng bundles of knotgrass and throwing them into the potion. ﬁDobby came to\\n visit me in the middle of the night.ﬂ \\n \\n      Ron and Hermione looked up, amazed. Harry\\n told them everything Dobby had told him Š or \\nhadn™t told him. Hermione and Ron listened with their mouths open. \\n \\n      ﬁThe Chamber of Secrets ha\\ns been opened before?ﬂ Hermione said.  \\n      ﬁThis settles it,ﬂ said Ron in a triumphant voice. ﬁLucius Malfoy must™ve opened the Chamber \\nwhen he was at school here and now he™s told \\ndear old Draco how to do it. It™s obvious. Wish \\nDobby™d told you what kind of monster™s in \\nthere, though. I want to know how come nobody™s \\nnoticed it sneaking \\naround the school.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁMaybe it can make itself invisible,ﬂ sa\\nid Hermione, prodding leeches to the bottom of the \\ncauldron. ﬁOr maybe it can disguise\\n itself Š pretend to be a suit of armor or something Š I™ve \\nread about Chameleon Ghouls Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁYou read too much, Hermione,ﬂ said R\\non, pouring dead lacewings on top of the leeches. He crumpled up the empty lacewing bag and looked at Harry. \\n \\n      ﬁSo Dobby stopped us from getting on the \\ntrain and broke your arm.ﬂ He shook his head. ﬁYou \\nknow what, Harry? If he doesn™t stop trying \\nto save your life he™s going to kill you.ﬂ \\n \\n    The news that Colin Creevey had been attacked and was now lying as though dead in the \\nhospital wing had spread through the entire school by Monday morning. The air was suddenly \\nthick with rumor and suspicion. The first years were now moving around the \\ncastle in tight-knit groups, as though scared they would be attacked if they ventured forth alone.  \\n      Ginny Weasley, who sat next to Colin Creevey in Charms, was distra\\nught, but Harry felt that Fred and George were going the wrong way about cheering her up. They were taking turns covering themselves with fur or boils and jump\\ning out at her from behind statues. They only \\nstopped when Percy, apoplectic with rage, told them he was going to write to Mrs. Weasley and \\ntell her Ginny was having nightmares. \\n \\n      Meanwhile, hidden from the teachers, a roari\\nng trade in talismans, amulet\\ns, and other protective devices was sweeping the school. Neville Longbo\\nttom bought a large, evil-smelling green onion, \\na pointed purple crystal, and a rotting newt tail before the other Gryffindor boys pointed out that he was in no danger; he was a pure-blood, and therefore unlikely to be attacked.       ﬁThey went for Filch first,ﬂ Neville \\nsaid, his round face fearful. ﬁAnd everyone knows I™m \\nalmost a Squib.ﬂ \\n       In the second week of December Profe\\nssor McGonagall came around as usual, collecting names \\nof those who would be staying at school for Christmas. Harry, Ron, and Hermione signed her \\nlist; they had heard that Malfoy was staying, which struck them as very suspicious. The holidays would be the perfect time to use the Polyjuice Potion and try to \\nworm a confession out of him. \\n \\n      Unfortunately, the potion was only half finished. They still needed the bicorn horn and the boomslang skin, and the only place they were going \\nto get them was from Snape™s private stores. \\nHarry privately felt he™d rather\\n face Slytherin™s legendary mons\\nter than let Snape catch him \\nrobbing his office.  \\n      ﬁWhat we need,ﬂ said Hermione briskly \\nas Thursday afternoon™s double Potions lesson loomed \\nnearer, ﬁis a diversion. Then one of us can sneak \\ninto Snape™s office and take what we need.ﬂ   \\n Harry and Ron looked at her nervously. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁI think I™d better do the actual stealing,ﬂ Hermione conti\\nnued in a matter-of-fact tone. ﬁYou two will be expelled if you get into any more trouble, \\nand I™ve got a clean record. So all you need to \\ndo is cause enough mayhem to keep Snape busy for five minutes or so.ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry smiled feebly. Deliberately causing mayhe\\nm in Snape™s Potions cla\\nss was about as safe as poking a sleeping dragon in the eye.  \\n      Potions lessons took place in one of the large dungeons. Thursday afternoon™s lesson proceeded in the usual way. Twenty cauldrons stood steaming between the wooden desks, on which stood \\nbrass scales and jars of ingredients. Snape prowled through the fumes, making waspish remarks \\nabout the Gryffindors™ work while the Slytherins sniggered appreciatively. Draco Malfoy, who \\nwas Snape™s favorite student, kept flicking puffer-fish eyes at Ron and Harry, who knew that if they retaliated they would get detention faster than you could say ﬁUnfair.ﬂ  \\n      Harry™s Swelling Solution was far too runny\\n, but he had his mind on mo\\nre important things. He \\nwas waiting for Hermione™s signal, \\nand he hardly listened as Snape paused to sneer at his watery potion. When Snape turned and walked off to bu\\nlly Neville, Hermione caught Harry™s eye and \\nnodded.  \\n      Harry ducked swiftly down behind his cauldr\\non, pulled one of Fred™s Filibuster fireworks out of \\nhis pocket, and gave it a quick prod with his wand. The firework began to fizz and sputter. Knowing he had only seconds, Harry straightened up, took aim, a\\nnd lobbed it into the air; it landed right on target in Goyle™s cauldron.  \\n      Goyle™s potion exploded, showering the whole class. People shrieked as splashes of the Swelling \\nSolution hit them. Malfoy got a faceful and hi\\ns nose began to swell like a balloon; Goyle \\nblundered around, his hands over his eyes, which had expanded to the size of a dinner plate Š Snape was trying to restore calm and find out \\nwhat had happened. Through the confusion, Harry saw Hermione slip quietly into Snape™s office. \\n       ﬁSilence! SILENCE!ﬂ Snape roared. ﬁAnyone who has been splashed, come here for a Deflating \\nDraft Š when I find out who did this Šﬂ  \\n      Harry tried not to laugh as he watched Malfoy hurry forward, his head drooping with the weight of a nose like a small melon. As half the class \\nlumbered up to Snape™s desk, some weighted \\ndown with arms like clubs, others unable to \\ntalk through gigantic puffed-up lips, Harry saw Hermione slide back into the dungeon, the front of her robes bulging. \\n \\n      When everyone had taken a swig of anti\\ndote and the various swellings had subsided, Snape \\nswept over to Goyle™s cauldron and scooped out the twisted black remains of the firework. There \\n\\nwas a sudden hush.  \\n      ﬁIf I ever find out who threw this,ﬂ Snape whispered, ﬁI shall make sure\\n that person is expelled.ﬂ  \\n      Harry arranged his face into what he hoped \\nwas a puzzled expression. Snape was looking right at \\nhim, and the bell that rang ten minutes la\\nter could not have been more welcome. \\n \\n      ﬁHe knew it was me,ﬂ Harry told Ron and He\\nrmione as they hurried back to Moaning Myrtle™s \\nbathroom. ﬁI could tell.ﬂ \\n \\n      Hermione threw the new ingredients in\\nto the cauldron and began to stir feverishly.  \\n      ﬁIt™ll be ready in two weeks,ﬂ she said happily.        ﬁSnape can™t prove it was you,ﬂ said Ron reassuringly to Harry. ﬁWhat can he do?ﬂ \\n       ﬁKnowing Snape, something foul,ﬂ \\nsaid Harry as the potion frothed and bubbled.  \\n      A week later, Harry, Ron, and Hermione we\\nre walking across the entrance hall when they saw a small knot of people gathered around the notice boa\\nrd, reading a piece of parchment that had just \\nbeen pinned up. Seamus Finnigan and Dean T\\nhomas beckoned them over, looking excited. \\n \\n      ﬁThey™re starting a Dueling Club!ﬂ said S\\neamus. ﬁFirst meeting tonigh\\nt! I wouldn™t mind dueling \\nlessons; they might come in handy one of these days–ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWhat, you reckon Slytherin™s monster can \\nduel?ﬂ said Ron, but he, \\ntoo, read the sign with interest. \\n \\n      ﬁCould be useful,ﬂ he said to Harry and Hermione as they went into dinner. ﬁShall we go?ﬂ \\n \\n    Harry and Hermione were all for it, so at ei\\nght o™clock that evening they hurried back to the \\nGreat Hall. The long dining tables had vanished and a golden stage had appeared along one wall, lit by thousands of candles floating overhead. Th\\ne ceiling was velvety black once more and most \\nof the school seemed to be packed beneath \\nit, all carrying their wands and looking excited.       ﬁI wonder who™ll be teaching us?ﬂ said He\\nrmione as they edged into the chattering crowd. \\nﬁSomeone told me Flitwick was a dueling champion when he was young Š maybe it™ll be him.ﬂ \\n       ﬁAs long as it™s not Šﬂ Harry began, but he ended on a groan: Gilderoy Lockhart was walking onto the stage, resplendent in robes of deep plum and accompanied by none other than Snape, \\n\\nwearing his usual black.  \\n      Lockhart waved an arm for silence and called ﬁGather round, gather round! Can everyone see me? Can you all hear me? Excellent! \\n \\n      ﬁNow, Professor Dumbledore has granted me \\npermission to start this l\\nittle dueling club, to train you all in case you ever need to defend yourselves as I myself \\nhave done on countless occasions Š for full details, see my published works.  \\n      ﬁLet me introduce my assistant, Professor \\nSnape,ﬂ said Lockhart, flashing a wide smile. ﬁHe tells \\nme he knows a tiny little bit abou\\nt dueling himself and has sportingl\\ny agreed to help me with a \\nshort demonstration before we begin. Now,\\n I don™t want any of you youngsters to worry Š \\nyou™ll still have your Potions master when\\n I™m through with him, never fear!ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWouldn™t it be good if they finish\\ned each other off?ﬂ Ron muttered in Harry™s ear. \\n \\n      Snape™s upper lip was curling. Harry wondered why Lockhart was still smiling; if Snape had \\nbeen looking at him like that he™d have been runn\\ning as fast as he could in the opposite direction.  \\n      Lockhart and Snape turned to face each other and bowed; at least, \\nLockhart did, with much \\ntwirling of his hands, whereas Snape jerked his head irritably. Then they raised their wands like \\nswords in front of them. \\n \\n      ﬁAs you see, we are holding our wands in the accepted combative position,ﬂ Lockhart told the \\nsilent crowd. ﬁOn the count of three, we will cast our first spells. Neither of us will be aiming to \\n\\nkill, of course.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁI wouldn™t bet on that,ﬂ Harry murmured, watching Snape baring his teeth. \\n \\n      ﬁOne Š two Š three Šﬂ \\n \\n      Both of them swung their wands above their heads and pointed them\\n at their opponent; Snape cried: ﬁExpelliarmus!ﬂ There was a dazzling flash \\nof scarlet light and Lockhart was blasted off \\nhis feet: He flew backward off the stage, smashed \\ninto the wall, and slid down it to sprawl on the \\nfloor.  \\n      Malfoy and some of the other Slytherins\\n cheered. Hermione was dancing on tiptoes. ﬁDo you \\nthink he™s all right?ﬂ she \\nsquealed through her fingers.  \\n      ﬁWho cares?ﬂ said Harry and Ron together. \\n\\n       Lockhart was getting unsteadily to his feet. His hat had fallen off and his wavy hair was standing on end.        ﬁWell, there you have it!ﬂ he said, tott\\nering back onto the platform. ﬁThat was a Disarming \\nCharm Š as you see, I™ve lost my wand Š ah, \\nthank you, Miss Brown Š yes, an excellent idea to show them that, Professor Snape, but if you don™t mind my saying so, it was very obvious \\nwhat you were about to do. If I had wanted to stop you it would have been only too easy Š however, I felt it would be instructive to let them see–ﬂ \\n \\n      Snape was looking murderous. Possibly Lockhart had noticed, because he said, ﬁEnough demonstrating! I™m going to come amongst you now \\nand put you all into pairs. Professor Snape, if you™d like to help me Šﬂ \\n \\n      They moved through the crowd, matching up \\npartners. Lockhart teamed\\n Neville with Justin Finch-Fletchley, but Snape reached Harry and Ron first. \\n \\n      ﬁTime to split up the dream team, I th\\nink,ﬂ he sneered. ﬁWeasle\\ny, you can partner Finnigan. Potter Šﬂ \\n \\n      Harry moved automatically toward Hermione. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁI don™t think so,ﬂ said Snape, smiling cold\\nly. ﬁMr. Malfoy, come over here. Let™s see what you \\nmake of the famous Potter. And you, Miss \\nGranger Š you can partner Miss Bulstrode.ﬂ  \\n      Malfoy strutted over, smirking. Behind him \\nwalked a Slytherin girl who reminded Harry of a \\npicture he™d seen in Holidays with Hags. She was large and square and her heavy jaw jutted aggressively. Hermione gave her a w\\neak smile that she did not return. \\n       ﬁFace your partners!ﬂ called Lo\\nckhart, back on the platform. ﬁAnd bow!ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry and Malfoy barely inclined thei\\nr heads, not taking their eyes off each other. \\n \\n      ﬁWands at the ready!ﬂ shouted Lockhart. \\nﬁWhen I count to three, cast your charms to disarm \\nyour opponents Š only to disarm them Š we do\\nn™t want any accidents Š one– two– three Š\\nﬂ  \\n      Harry swung his wand high, but Malfoy had already started on ﬁtwoﬂ: His spell hit Harry so hard he felt as though he™d been hit over the head with a saucepan. He stumbled, but everything still \\nseemed to be working, and wasting no more time,\\n Harry pointed his wand straight at Malfoy and shouted, ﬁRictusempra!ﬂ  \\n      A jet of silver light hit Malfoy in the stomach and he doubled up, wheezing. \\n \\n      ﬁI said disarm only!ﬂ Lockhart shouted in\\n alarm over the heads of th\\ne battling crowd, as Malfoy sank to his knees; Harry had hit him with a Ti\\nckling Charm, and he could barely move for \\nlaughing. Harry hung back, with a vague feeling it \\nwould be unsporting to bewitch Malfoy while he was on the floor, but this was a mistake; gasping for breath, Malfoy pointed his wand at \\nHarry™s knees, choked, ﬁTarantallegra!ﬂ and the next second Harry™s legs began to jerk around out of his control in a kind of quickstep.  \\n      ﬁStop! Stop!ﬂ screamed Lockhart, but Sn\\nape took charge. ﬁFinite Incantatem!ﬂ he shouted; \\nHarry™s feet stopped dancing, Malfoy stopped laughing, and they were able to look up.  \\n      A haze of greenish smoke was hovering over the scene. Both Neville and Justin were lying on \\nthe floor, panting; Ron was holding up an ashen-faced Seamus, apologizing for whatever his \\nbroken wand had done; but Hermione and Millicent \\nBulstrode were still moving; Millicent had Hermione in a headlock and Hermione was whim\\npering in pain; both their wands lay forgotten on the floor. Harry leapt forward and pulled Millicent off. It was difficult: She was a lot bigger than he was.  \\n      ﬁDear, dear,ﬂ said Lockhart, skittering through the crowd, looking at the aftermath of the duels. \\nﬁUp you go, Macmillan–ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁCareful there, Miss Fawcett– Pi\\nnch it hard, it™ll stop bleeding in a second,ﬂ  \\n      ﬁI think I™d better teach you how to block unfriendly spells,ﬂ said Lockhart, standing flustered in the midst of the hall. He glanced at Snape, w\\nhose black eyes glinted, and looked quickly away. ﬁLet™s have a volunteer pair Š Longbottom and Finch-Fletchley, how about you Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁA bad idea, Professor Lockhart,ﬂ said Snape, gliding over like a large and malevolent bat. \\nﬁLongbottom causes devastation with the simplest sp\\nells. We™ll be sending what™s left of Finch-\\nFletchley up to the hospital wing in a matchbox.ﬂ\\n Neville™s round, pink face went pinker. ﬁHow \\nabout Malfoy and Potter?ﬂ said \\nSnape with a twisted smile. \\n \\n      ﬁExcellent idea!ﬂ said Lockhart, gesturing Harry and Malfoy into the middle of the hall as the \\ncrowd backed away to give them room. \\n \\n      ﬁNow, Harry,ﬂ said Lockhart. ﬁWhe\\nn Draco points his wand at you, you do this.ﬂ  \\n      He raised his own wand, attempted a compli\\ncated sort of wiggling action, and dropped it. Snape smirked as Lockhart quickly picked it up, sayin\\ng, ﬁWhoopsŠ my wand is a \\nlittle overexcitedŠﬂ  \\n      Snape moved closer to Malfoy, bent down, and whispered something in his ear. Malfoy smirked, \\ntoo. Harry looked up nervously at Lockhart and \\nsaid, ﬁProfessor, could you show me that \\nblocking thing again?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁScared?ﬂ muttered Malfoy, so \\nthat Lockhart couldn™t hear him. \\n \\n      ﬁYou wish,ﬂ said Harry out of the corner of his mouth. \\n\\n \\n      Lockhart cuffed Harry merrily on the shoulder. ﬁJust do what I did, Harry!ﬂ \\n\\n       ﬁWhat, drop my wand?ﬂ \\n      But Lockhart wasn™t listening. \\n \\n      ﬁThree Š two Š one Š go!ﬂ he shouted. \\n \\n      Malfoy raised his wand quickly and bellowed, ﬁSerpensortia!ﬂ  \\n      The end of his wand exploded. Harry watched, aghast, as a long black snake shot out of it, fell \\nheavily onto the floor between them, and raised itself, ready to strike. There were screams as the \\ncrowd backed swiftly away, clearing the floor.  \\n      ﬁDon™t move, Potter,ﬂ said Snape lazily, clearly enjoying the sight of Harry standing motionless, \\neye to eye with the angry sn\\nake. ﬁI™ll get rid of it–ﬂ  \\n      ﬁAllow me!ﬂ shouted Lockhart. He brandish\\ned his wand at the snake and there was a loud bang; the snake, instead of vanishing, flew ten feet into the air and fell back to the floor with a loud smack. Enraged, hissing furiously, it slithered strai\\nght toward Justin Finch-Fletchley and raised \\nitself again, fangs exposed, poised to strike.  \\n      Harry wasn™t sure what made him do it. He\\n wasn™t even aware of deciding to do it. All he knew was that his legs were carrying him forward as though he was on casters and that he had shouted \\nstupidly at the snake, ﬁLeave him alone!ﬂ A\\nnd miraculously Š inexplicably Š the snake \\nslumped to the floor, docile as a thick, black ga\\nrden hose, its eyes now on Harry. Harry felt the fear drain out of him. He kne\\nw the snake wouldn™t attack anyone now, though how he knew it, he couldn™t have explained.        He looked up at Justin, grinning, expecting to see Justin looking relieved, or puzzled, or even grateful Š but certainly\\n not angry and scared.        ﬁWhat do you think you™re playing at?ﬂ he \\nshouted, and before Harry could say anything, Justin had turned and stormed out of the hall. \\n \\n      Snape stepped forward, waved his wand, and the snake vanished in a small puff of black smoke. \\nSnape, too, was looking at Harry in an unexpected way: It was a shrewd and calculating look, and Harry didn™t like it. He was also dimly aware of an ominous muttering all around the walls. \\nThen he felt a tugging on the back of his robes.  \\n      ﬁCome on,ﬂ said Ron™s voice in his ear. ﬁMove Š come on Šﬂ \\n\\n \\n      Ron steered him out of the hall, Hermione\\n hurrying alongside them. As they went through the \\ndoors, the people on either side drew away as though they were frightened of catching something. Harry didn™t have a clue what \\nwas going on, and neither Ron nor Hermione \\nexplained anything until they had dragged him \\nall the way up to the empty Gryffindor common \\nroom. \\n \\n      Then Ron pushed Harry into an armchair\\n and said, ﬁYou™re a Parselmouth. Why didn™t you tell \\nus?ﬂ       ﬁI™m a what?ﬂ said Harry. \\n \\n      ﬁA Parselmouth!ﬂ said Ron. ﬁYou can talk to snakes!ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁI know,ﬂ said Harry. ﬁI mean, that™s only\\n the second time I™ve ever do\\nne it. I accidentally set a boa constrictor on my cousin Dudley at the z\\noo once Š long story Š but it was telling me it had \\nnever seen Brazil and I sort of set it free without meaning to \\nthat was before I knew I was a wizard Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁA boa constrictor told you it had never seen Brazil?ﬂ Ron repeated faintly.  \\n      ﬁSo?ﬂ said Harry. ﬁI be\\nt loads of people here can do it.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁOh, no they can™t,ﬂ said Ron. ﬁIt™s not a very common gift. Harry, this is bad.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁWhat™s bad?ﬂ said Harry, starting to feel\\n quite angry. ﬁWhat™s wrong with everyone? Listen, if I \\nhadn™t told that snake not to attack Justin Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁOh, that™s what you said to it?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWhat d™you mean? You were there Š you heard me Šﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁI heard you speaking Parseltongue,ﬂ said Ron. ﬁSnake language. You could have been saying anything Š no wonder Justin panicked, you sounded like you were egging the snake on or something Š it was creepy, you know Šﬂ \\n \\n      Harry gaped at him. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁI spoke a different language? But Š I \\ndidn™t realize Š how can I speak a language without knowing I can speak it?ﬂ  \\n      Ron shook his head. Both he and Hermione were looking as though someone had died. Harry \\ncouldn™t see what was so terrible.  \\n      ﬁD™you want to tell me what™s wrong with \\nstopping a massive snake biting off Justin™s head?ﬂ he \\nsaid. ﬁWhat does it matter how I did it as long as Ju\\nstin doesn™t have to join the Headless Hunt?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁIt matters,ﬂ said Hermione, speaking at last\\n in a hushed voice, ﬁbecause\\n being able to talk to snakes was what Salazar Slytherin was famous for. That™s why th\\ne symbol of Slytherin House is a serpent.ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry™s mouth fell open. \\n \\n      ﬁExactly,ﬂ said Ron. ﬁAnd now the whole school™s going to think you™re his great-great-great-\\ngreat-grandson or something Šﬂ \\n       ﬁBut I™m not,ﬂ said Harry, \\nwith a panic he couldn™t quite explain.  \\n      ﬁYou™ll find that hard to prove,ﬂ said Hermione. ﬁHe lived about a thousand years ago; for all we know, you could be.ﬂ  \\n      Harry lay awake for hours that night. Through a gap in the curtains around his four-poster he watched snow starting to drift past the tower window and wondered–   \\n      Could he be a descendant of Salazar Slithering? He didn™t know anything about his father™s \\nfamily, after all. The Dursleys had always fo\\nrbidden questions about his wizarding relatives.  \\n      Quietly, Harry tried to say something in \\nParseltongue. The words wouldn™t come. It seemed he \\nhad to be face-to-face with a snake to do it. \\n \\n      But I™m in Gryffindor, Harry thought. The So\\nrting Hat wouldn™t have put me in here if I had \\nSlytherin blood–   \\n      Ah, said a nasty little voice in his brain, but the Sorting Hat wanted to put you in Slytherin, don™t \\nyou remember? \\n \\n      Harry turned over. He™d see Justin the ne\\nxt day in Herbology and he™d explain that he™d been calling the snake off, not egging it on, which (he thought angrily, pummeling his pillow) any fool \\nshould have realized.  \\n      By next morning, however, the snow that had begun in the night had turned into a blizzard so thick that the last Herbology lesson of the term was canceled: Pr\\nofessor Sprout wanted to fit socks and scarves on the Mandrakes, a tricky operation she would \\nentrust to no one else, now that it was so important for the Mandrakes to gr\\now quickly and revive Mrs. Norris and Colin \\nCreevey.  \\n      Harry fretted about this next to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, while Ron and Hermione used their time off to play a game of wizard chess. \\n \\n      ﬁFor heaven™s sake, Harry,ﬂ said Hermione\\n, exasperated, as one of Ron™s bishops wrestled her knight off his horse and dragged him off the board. ﬁGo and find Ju\\nstin if it™s so important to \\nyou.ﬂ  \\n      So Harry got up and left through the portrait hole, wondering where Justin might be. \\n \\n      The castle was darker than it usually was in\\n daytime because of the thick, swirling gray snow at \\nevery window. Shivering, Harry walked past classrooms where lessons were taking place, \\ncatching snatches of what was happening within. Professor McGonagall was shouting at \\nsomeone who, by the sound of it, had turned his frie\\nnd into a badger. Resisting the urge to take a look, Harry walked on by, thinking that Justin might\\n be using his free time to catch up on some \\nwork, and deciding to check the library first.        A group of the Hufflepuffs who should have \\nbeen in Herbology were indeed sitting at the back of the library, but they didn™t seem to be wo\\nrking. Between the long lines of high bookshelves, Harry could see that their heads were close together and they were having what looked like an absorbing conversation. He couldn™t see whether Justin was among them. He was walking \\ntoward them when something of what they were\\n saying met his ears, and he paused to listen, \\n\\nhidden in the Invisibility section. \\n \\n      ﬁSo anyway,ﬂ a stout boy was saying, ﬁI told Justin to hide up in our dormitory. I mean to say, if \\nPotter™s marked him down as his next victim, it™s \\nbest if he keeps a low profile for a while. Of course, Justin™s been waiting for something like this to happen ever since he let slip to Potter he \\nwas Muggle-born. Justin actually told him he™d b\\neen down for Eton. That™s not the kind of thing you bandy about with Slytherin™s heir on the loose, is it?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁYou definitely think it is Potter, then, Ernie?ﬂ said a girl with blonde pigtails anxiously.  \\n      ﬁHannah,ﬂ said the stout boy solemnly, ﬁhe™s a Parselmouth. Everyone knows that™s the mark of \\na Dark wizard. Have you ever heard of a decen\\nt one who could talk to snakes? They called \\nSlytherin himself Serpent-tongue.ﬂ \\n \\n      There was some heavy murmuring at th\\nis, and Ernie went on, ﬁRemember what was written on \\nthe wall? Enemies of the Heir, Beware. Potter had \\nsome sort of run-in with Filch. Next thing we \\nknow, Filch™s cat™s attacked. That first year, Creevey, was annoying Potter at the Quidditch match, taking pictures of him while he was lyi\\nng in the mud. Next thing we know Š Creevey™s \\n\\nbeen attacked.ﬂ        ﬁHe always seems so nice, though,ﬂ said \\nHannah uncertainly, ﬁand, well, he™s the one who made \\nYou-Know-Who disappear. He can™t be all bad, can he?ﬂ \\n       Ernie lowered his voice my\\nsteriously, the Hufflepuffs bent closer, and Harry edged nearer so that he could catch Ernie™s words.  \\n      ﬁNo one knows how he survived that attack by You-Know-Who. I mean to say, he was only a \\nbaby when it happened. He should have been blasted into smithereens. Only a really powerful \\nDark wizard could have survived a curse like \\nthat.ﬂ He dropped his voice until it was barely \\nmore than a whisper, and said, ﬁThat™s probably why You- Know-Who wanted to kill him in the \\nfirst place. Didn™t want another Dark Lord competing with him.\\n I wonder what other powers \\nPotter™s been hiding?ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry couldn™t take anymore. Clearing hi\\ns throat loudly, he stepped out from behind the \\nbookshelves. If he hadn™t been feeling so angry, he would have found the sight that greeted him \\nfunny: Every one of the Hufflepuffs looked as though they had been Petrified by the sight of him, and the color was draining out of Ernie™s face. \\n \\n      ﬁHello,ﬂ said Harry. ﬁI™m looking for Justin Finch-Fletchley.ﬂ        The Hufflepuffs™ worst fears had clearly been confirmed. They all look\\ned fearfully at Ernie.       ﬁWhat do you want with hi\\nm?ﬂ said Ernie in a quavering voice. \\n       ﬁI wanted to tell him what really happene\\nd with that snake at the Dueling Club,ﬂ said Harry.  \\n      Ernie bit his white lips and then, taking a deep breath, said, ﬁWe were all there. We saw what \\nhappened.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁThen you noticed that after I spoke to it, the snake backed off?ﬂ said Harry. \\n \\n      ﬁAll I saw,ﬂ said Ernie stubbornly, though he was trembling as he spoke, ﬁwas you speaking \\nParseltongue and chasing the snake toward Justin.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁI didn™t chase it at him!ﬂ Harry said, his \\nvoice shaking with anger. ﬁIt didn™t even touch him!ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁIt was a very near miss,ﬂ said Ernie. ﬁAnd in case you™re getting ideas,ﬂ he added hastily, ﬁI might tell you that you can trace my family b\\nack through nine generations of witches and warlocks and my blood™s as pure as anyone™s, so Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁ- I don™t care what sort of blood you™ve got!ﬂ said Harry fiercely. ﬁWhy would I want to attack \\nMuggle-borns?ﬂ  \\n      ﬁI™ve heard you hate those Muggles you live with,ﬂ said Ernie swiftly.  \\n      ﬁIt™s not possible to live with the Dursleys and not hate them,ﬂ\\n said Harry. ﬁI™d like to see you try it.ﬂ  \\n      He turned on his heel and stormed out \\nof the library, earning hims\\nelf a reproving glare from \\nMadam Pince, who was polishing the \\ngilded cover of a large spellbook.  \\n      Harry blundered up the corridor, barely noticing where he was going, he was in such a fury. The result was that he walked into something ve\\nry large and solid, which knocked him backward \\n\\nonto the floor.  \\n      ﬁOh, hello, Hagrid,ﬂ Harry said, looking up.  \\n      Hagrid™s face was entirely hidden by a woolly, snow-covered balaclava, but it couldn™t possibly \\nbe anyone else, as he filled most of the corridor\\n in his moleskin overcoat. A dead rooster was \\nhanging from one of his massive, gloved hands. \\n \\n      ﬁAll righ™, Harry?ﬂ he said, pulling up th\\ne balaclava so he could speak. ﬁWhy aren™t yeh in \\nclass?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁCanceled,ﬂ said Harry, getting up. ﬁWhat™re you doing in here?ﬂ \\n \\n      Hagrid held up the limp rooster.        ﬁSecond one killed this term,ﬂ he explaine\\nd. ﬁIt™s either foxes or a \\nBlood-Suckin Bugbear, an™ I need the Headmaster™s permission \\nter put a charm around the hen coop.ﬂ \\n \\n      He peered more closely at Harr\\ny from under his thick, snowflecked eyebrows. \\n \\n      ﬁYeh sure yeh™re all righ™? Yeh look all ho\\nt an™ bothered Šﬂ  \\n      Harry couldn™t bring himself to repeat what \\nErnie and the rest of the Hufflepuffs had been saying about him. \\n \\n      ﬁIt™s nothing,ﬂ he said. ﬁI™d better get going, Hagrid, it™s Transfiguration next and I™ve got to pick up my books.ﬂ \\n \\n      He walked off, his mind still full of what Ernie had said about him. \\n \\n      ﬁJustin™s been waiting for something like this to\\n happen ever since he let slip to Potter he was \\nMuggle-born–ﬂ  \\n      Harry stamped up the stairs and turned al\\nong another corridor, which was particularly dark; the torches had been extinguished by a strong, icy draft that was blowing through a loose \\nwindowpane. He was halfway down the passage when\\n he tripped headlong over something lying \\non the floor.  \\n      He turned to squint at what he™d fa\\nllen over and felt as though his stomach had dissolved. \\n       Justin Finch-Fletchley was lying on the floor, rigid and cold, a look of shock frozen on his face, his eyes staring blankly at the \\nceiling. And that wasn™t all. Next to him was another figure, the \\nstrangest sight Harry had ever seen.        It was Nearly Headless Nick, no longer pearly-white and transparent, but black and smoky, \\nfloating immobile and horizontal, six inches of\\nf the floor. His head was half off and his face wore an expression of shock identical to Justin™s. \\n \\n      Harry got to his feet, his breathing fast and shallow, his heart doing a kind of drumroll against his \\nribs. He looked wildly up and down the deserted corridor and saw a line of spiders scuttling as \\nfast as they could away from the bodies. The \\nonly sounds were the muffled voices of teachers \\nfrom the classes on either side. \\n \\n      He could run, and no one would ever know he had been there. But he couldn™t just leave them lying here– He had to get help– Would anyone be\\nlieve he hadn™t had anything to do with this?  \\n      As he stood there, panicking, a door right next to him opened \\nwith a bang. Peeves the Poltergeist came shooting out. \\n \\n      ﬁWhy, it™s potty wee Potter!ﬂ cackled P\\neeves, knocking Harry™s glasses askew as he bounced past him. ﬁWhat™s Potter up to? Why™s Potter lurking Šﬂ \\n      Peeves stopped, halfway through a midair somersault. Upside down, he spotted Justin and Nearly \\nHeadless Nick. He flipped the right way up, filled his lungs and, before Harry could stop him, \\nscreamed, ﬁATTACK! ATTACK! ANOTHER ATTA\\nCK! NO MORTAL OR GHOST IS SAFE! \\nRUN FOR YOUR LIVE\\nS! ATTAAAACK!ﬂ  \\n      Crash Š crash Š crash Š door after door flew open along the corridor and people flooded out. For several long minutes, there was \\na scene of such confusion that Justin was in danger of being squashed and people kept standing in Nearly Headless Nick. Harry found himself pinned against \\nthe wall as the teachers shouted for quiet. Pr\\nofessor McGonagall came running, followed by her \\nown class, one of whom still had black-and-whit\\ne-striped hair. She used her wand to set off a loud bang, which restored silence, and ordered everyone back into their classes. No sooner had the scene cleared somewhat than Ernie the \\nHufflepuff arrived, panting, on the scene.  \\n      ﬁCaught in the act!ﬂ Ernie yelled, his face stark white, pointing \\nhis finger dramatically at Harry. \\n \\n      ﬁThat will do, Macmillan!ﬂ said Professor McGonagall sharply.  \\n      Peeves was bobbing overhead, now grinning wickedly, surveying the scene; Peeves always loved chaos. As the teachers bent over Justin and Near\\nly Headless Nick, examining them, Peeves broke \\ninto song:  \\n      ﬁOh, Potter, you rotter, oh, what have you done, You™re killing off™ students, you think it™s good fun Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁThat™s enough Peeves!ﬂ barked Professor McGonagall, and Peeves zoomed away backward, \\nwith his tongue out at Harry. \\n \\n      Justin was carried up to the hospital wi\\nng by Professor Flitwick and Pr\\nofessor Sinistra of the Astronomy department, but nobody seemed to know what to do for Nearly Headless Nick. In the \\n\\nend, Professor McGonagall conjured a large fan out of thin air, which she gave to Ernie with \\ninstructions to waft Nearly Headless Nick up the stairs. This Ernie did, fanning Nick along like a silent black hovercraft. This left Harry and Professor McGonagall alone together.  \\n      ﬁThis way, Potter,ﬂ she said. \\n \\n      ﬁProfessor,ﬂ said Harry at once, ﬁI swear I didn™t Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁThis is out of my hands, Po\\ntter,ﬂ said Professor McGonagall curtly. \\n \\n      They marched in silence around a corner\\n and she stopped before a large and extremely ugly \\nstone gargoyle.  \\n      ﬁLemon drop!ﬂ she said. This was eviden\\ntly a password, because the gargoyle sprang suddenly \\nto life and hopped aside as the wall behind him \\nsplit in two. Even full of dread for what was coming, Harry couldn™t fail to be amazed. Behind th\\ne wall was a spiral staircase that was moving \\nsmoothly upward, like an escalator. As he and \\nProfessor McGonagall stepped onto it, Harry heard the wall thud closed behind them. They rose upward in circles, higher and higher, until at last, slightly dizzy, Harry saw a gleaming oak door\\n ahead, with a brass knocker in the shape of a griffin.  \\n      He knew now where he was being taken. This must be where Dumbledore lived. \\n\\n \\n              \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  CHAPTER TWELVE   \\nThe Polyjuice Potion     They stepped off the stone staircase at the \\ntop, and Professor McGonagall rapped on the door. It opened silently and they entered. Professor McGonagall told Harry to wait and left him there, \\nalone.  \\n      Harry looked around. One thing was certain: of all the teachers™ offices Harry had visited so far this year, Dumbledore™s was by far the most interest\\ning. If he hadn™t been scared out of his wits that he was about to be thrown out of school, he would have been very pleased to have a chance to look around it.  \\n      It was a large and beautiful circular room, full of funny little \\nnoises. A number of curious silver \\ninstruments stood on spindle legged tables, whirri\\nng and emitting little puffs of smoke. The walls \\nwere covered with portraits of old headmasters and headmistresses, all of whom were snoozing \\n\\ngently in their frames. There was also an e\\nnormous, claw-footed desk, and, sitting on a shelf \\nbehind it, a shabby, tattered wizard™s hat Š the Sorting Hat. \\n \\n      Harry hesitated. He cast a wary eye around the sleeping witches and wizards on the walls. Surely it couldn™t hurt if he took the hat down and tried it on again? Just to see– just to make sure it \\nhad put him in the right House. \\n \\n      He walked quietly around the desk, lifted the hat from its shelf, and lowered it slowly onto his \\nhead. It was much too large and slipped down over his eyes, just as it had done the last time he™d \\nput it on. Harry stared at the black inside of the hat, waiting. Then a small voice said in his ear, \\nﬁBee in your bonnet, Harry Potter?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁEr, yes,ﬂ Harry muttered. ﬁEr Š \\nsorry to bother you Š I wanted to ask Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁYou™ve been wondering whether I put you in the right House,ﬂ said the hat smartly. ﬁYes– you \\nwere particularly difficult to place. But I stand \\nby what I said before Šﬂ Harry™s heart leapt Š \\nﬁyou would have done well in Slytherin Šﬂ  \\n      Harry™s stomach plummeted. He grabbed the \\npoint of the hat and pulled it off. It hung limply in \\nhis hand, grubby and faded. Harry pushed it back onto its shelf, feeling sick.  \\n      ﬁYou™re wrong,ﬂ he said aloud to the still and silent hat. It didn™t move. Harry backed away, \\nwatching it. Then a strange, gagging noise behind him made him wheel around. \\n \\n      He wasn™t alone after all. Standing on a golden perch behind the door was a decrepit-looking bird that resembled a half-plucked turkey. Harry \\nstared at it and the bird looked balefully back, \\nmaking its gagging noise again. Harry\\n thought it looked very ill. Its eyes were dull and, even as \\nHarry watched, a couple more feathers fell out of its tail.        Harry was just thinking that all he needed was for Dumbledore™s pet bird to die while he was \\nalone in the office with it, when the bird burst into flames. \\n \\n      Harry yelled in shock and backed away into the desk. He looked feverishly around in case there was a glass of water somewhere but couldn™t \\nsee one; the bird, meanwhile, had become a \\nfireball; it gave one loud shriek and next second there was nothing but a smoldering pile of ash on the floor.  \\n      The office door opened. Dumbledore came in, looking very somber. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁProfessor,ﬂ Harry gasped. ﬁYour bird Š I couldn™t do anything Š he just caught fire Šﬂ  \\n      To Harry™s astonishment, Dumbledore smiled. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁAbout time, too,ﬂ he said. ﬁHe™s been look\\ning dreadful for days; I™ve been telling him to get a \\nmove on.ﬂ  \\n      He chuckled at the stunned look on Harry™s face. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁFawkes is a phoenix, Harry. Phoenixes burst into flame when it is time for them to die and are \\nreborn from the ashes. Watch him–ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry looked down in time to see a tiny, wrinkl\\ned, newborn bird poke its head out of the ashes. It was quite as ugly as the old one.        ﬁIt™s a shame you had to see him on a Burn\\ning Day,ﬂ said Dumbledore,\\n seating himself behind \\nhis desk. ﬁHe™s really very handsome most of\\n the time, wonderful red and gold plumage. \\nFascinating creatures, phoenixes. They can carry immensely heavy loads, their tears have healing powers, and they make highly faithful pets.ﬂ \\n       In the shock of Fawkes catching fire, Harry had forgotten what he was there for, but it all came \\nback to him as Dumbledore settled himself in \\nthe high chair behind the desk and fixed Harry with his penetrating, light-blue stare.  \\n      Before Dumbledore could speak another wor\\nd, however, the door of the office flew open with an almighty bang and Hagrid burst in, a wild look in\\n his eyes, his balaclava perched on top of his shaggy black head and the dead rooster still swinging from his hand. \\n \\n      ﬁIt wasn™ Harry, Professor Dumbledore!ﬂ said Hagrid urgently. ﬁI was talkin™ ter him seconds \\nbefore that kid was found, he never had time, sir Šﬂ \\n \\n      Dumbledore tried to say something, but Ha\\ngrid went ranting on, waving the rooster around in his agitation, sending feathers everywhere.  \\n      ﬁit can™t™ve bin him, I™ll swear it in \\nfront o™ the Ministry o™ Magic if I have to.ﬂ        ﬁHagrid, I Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁŠ yeh™ve got the wrong boy, sir, I know Harry never Šﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁHagrid!ﬂ said Dumbledore loudly. ﬁI do \\nnot think that Harry attacked those people.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁOh,ﬂ said Hagrid, the rooster falling limply at his side. \\nﬁRight. I™ll wait outside then, Headmaster.ﬂ \\n \\n      And he stomped out looking embarrassed. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁYou don™t think it was me, Professor?\\nﬂ Harry repeated hopefully as Dumbledore brushed \\nrooster feathers off his desk.  \\n      ﬁNo, Harry, I don™t,ﬂ said Dumbledore, thoug\\nh his face was somber again. ﬁBut I still want to \\ntalk to you.ﬂ  \\n      Harry waited nervously while Dumbledore considered him, the tips of his long fingers together.  \\n      ﬁI must ask you, Harry, whether there is\\n anything you™d like to tell me,ﬂ he said gently. \\nﬁAnything at all.ﬂ  \\n      Harry didn™t know what to say. He thought of Malfoy shouting, ﬁYou™ll be next, Mudbloods!ﬂ and of the Polyjuice Potion simmering away in \\nMoaning Myrtle™s bathroom. Then he thought of \\nthe disembodied voice he had heard twice and \\nremembered what Ron ha\\nd said: ﬁHearing voices no one else can hear isn™t a good sign, even in the wizarding world.ﬂ He thought, too, about what everyone was saying about him, and his growing \\ndread that he was somehow connected with \\nSalazar Slytherin–   \\n      ﬁNo,ﬂ said Harry. ﬁThere isn™t anything, Professor–ﬂ \\n\\n \\n  The double attack on Justin and Nearly Head\\nless Nick turned what had hitherto been nervousness into real panic. Curiously, it was Nearly Headless Nick™s fate that seemed to worry \\npeople most. What could possibly do that to a \\nghost? people asked each other; what terrible \\npower could harm someone who was already dead\\n? There was almost a stampede to book seats \\non the Hogwarts Express so that students could go home for Christmas. \\n \\n      ﬁAt this rate, we™ll be the only ones left,ﬂ Ron told Harry and Hermione. ﬁUs, Malfoy, Crabbe, \\nand Goyle. What a jolly holiday it™s going to be.ﬂ  \\n      Crabbe and Goyle, who always did whatever Malfoy did, had signed up to stay over the holidays, too. But Harry was glad that most people were leaving. \\nHe was tired of people skirting around him in the corridors, as though he was about to\\n sprout fangs or spit poison; tired of all the muttering, pointing, and hissing as he passed.        Fred and George, however, found all this very funny. They went out of their way to march ahead \\nof Harry down the corridors, shouting, ﬁMake way for the Heir of Slytherin, seriously evil wizard coming through–ﬂ \\n       Percy was deeply disapproving of this behavior. \\n \\n      ﬁIt is not a laughing matter,ﬂ he said coldly. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁOh, get out of the way, Percy,ﬂ said Fred. ﬁHarry™s in a hurry.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁYeah, he™s off to the Chamber of Secrets fo\\nr a cup of tea with his fanged servant,ﬂ said George, \\nchortling.  \\n      Ginny didn™t find it amusing either. \\n \\n      ﬁOh, don™t,ﬂ she wailed every time Fred aske\\nd Harry loudly who he was planning to attack next, or when George pretended to ward Harry off with a large clove of garlic when they met. \\n \\n      Harry didn™t mind; it made \\nhim feel better that Fred and George\\n, at least, thought the idea of his being Slytherin™s heir was quite ludicrous. But their antics seemed to be aggravating Draco \\nMalfoy, who looked increasingly sour each time he saw them at it. \\n \\n      ﬁIt™s because he™s bursting to say it™s really him,ﬂ said Ron knowingly. ﬁYou know how he hates anyone beating him at anything, and you™re getting all the credit for his dirty work.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁNot for long,ﬂ said Hermione in a satisfie\\nd tone. ﬁThe Polyjuice Potion™s nearly ready. We™ll be \\ngetting the truth out of him any day now.ﬂ  \\n      At last the term ended, and a silence d\\neep as the snow on the grounds descended on the castle. Harry found it peaceful, rather than gloomy, and \\nenjoyed the fact that he, Hermione, and the \\nWeasleys had the run of Gryffindor Tower, which meant they could play Exploding Snap loudly \\nwithout bothering anyone, and practice dueling in private. Fred, George, and Ginny had chosen to stay at school rather than visit Bill in Egypt with Mr\\n. and Mrs. Weasley. Percy, who \\ndisapproved of what he termed their childish be\\nhavior, didn™t spend much\\n time in the Gryffindor \\ncommon room. He had already told them pompou\\nsly that he was only staying over Christmas \\nbecause it was his duty as a prefect to s\\nupport the teachers during this troubled time. \\n \\n      Christmas morning dawned, cold and white. \\nHarry and Ron, the only ones left in their dormitory, were woken very early by Hermione, who burst i\\nn, fully dressed and carrying presents for them \\nboth.  \\n      ﬁWake up,ﬂ she said loudly, pul\\nling back the curtains at the window.  \\n      ﬁHermione Š you™re not supposed to be in \\nhere Šﬂ said Ron, shielding his eyes against the light.        ﬁMerry Christmas to you, too,ﬂ said Herm\\nione, throwing him his present. ﬁI™ve been up for \\nnearly an hour, adding more lacew\\nings to the potion. It™s ready.ﬂ        Harry sat up, suddenly wide awake. \\n \\n      ﬁAre you sure?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁPositive,ﬂ said Hermione, shifting Scabbe\\nrs the rat so that she co\\nuld sit down on the end of Ron™s four-poster. ﬁIf we™re going to do it, I say it should be tonight.ﬂ  \\n      At that moment, Hedwig\\n swooped into the room, carrying a \\nvery small package in her beak. \\n \\n      ﬁHello,ﬂ said Harry happily as she landed on his bed. ﬁAre you speaking to me again?ﬂ \\n \\n      She nibbled his ear in an affectionate sort of way, which was a far better present than the one that she had brought him, which turned out to be from\\n the Dursleys. They had sent Harry a toothpick and a note telling him to find out whether he™d be\\n able to stay at Hogwarts for the summer \\nvacation, too. \\n \\n      The rest of Harry™s Christmas presents we\\nre far more satisfactory. Hagrid had sent him a large \\ntin of treacle fudge, which Harry decided to soften by the fire before eating; Ron had given him a \\nbook called Flying with the Cannons, a book of interesting facts about his favorite Quidditch \\nteam, and Hermione had bought him a luxurious\\n eagle-feather quill. Harry opened the last present to find a new, hand-knitted sweater from \\nMrs. Weasley and a large plum cake. He read \\nher card with a fresh surge of guilt, thinking about Mr. Weasley™s car (which hadn™t been seen \\n\\nsince its crash with the Whomping Willow), and \\nthe bout of rule-breaking he and Ron were \\nplanning next.  \\n      No one, not even someone dreading taking Po\\nlyjuice Potion later, could fail to enjoy Christmas \\ndinner at Hogwarts.  \\n      The Great Hall looked magnificent. Not onl\\ny were there a dozen frost-covered Christmas trees \\nand thick streamers of holly and mistletoe cr\\nisscrossing the ceiling, but enchanted snow was falling, warm and dry, from the ceiling. Dumbledore \\nled them in a few of his favorite carols, Hagrid booming more and more loudly with \\nevery goblet of eggnog he consumed. Percy, who \\nhadn™t noticed that Fred had bewitched his prefect badge so that \\nit now read ﬁPinhead,ﬂ kept asking them all what they were sniggering at\\n. Harry didn™t even care that Draco Malfoy was \\nmaking loud, snide remark about his new sweater fr\\nom the Slytherin table. With a bit of luck, \\nMalfoy would be getting his comeuppance in a few hours™ time. \\n \\n      Harry and Ron had barely finished their third helpings of Christmas pudding when Hermione \\nushered them out of the hall to finalize their plans for the evening.  \\n      ﬁWe still need a bit of the people you™re \\nchanging into,ﬂ said Hermione matter-of-factly, as \\nthough she were sending them to the supermarket \\nfor laundry detergent. ﬁAnd obviously, it™ll be best if you can get something of Crabbe™s and Goyle™s; they™re Malfoys \\nbest friends, he™ll tell them anything. And we also need to make sure \\nthe real Crabbe and Goyle can™t burst in on us while we™re interrogating him. \\n       ﬁI™ve got it all worked out,ﬂ she went on smoothly, ignoring Harry™s a\\nnd Ron™s stupefied faces. She held up two plump chocolate \\ncakes. ﬁI™ve filled these with a simple Sleeping Draught. All \\nyou have to do is make sure Crabbe and G\\noyle find them. You know how greedy they are, \\nthey™re bound to eat them. Once they™re asleep, pull out a few of their hairs and hide them in a \\nbroom closet.ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry and Ron looked incredulously at each other. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁHermione, I don™t think Šﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁThat could go seriously wrong Šﬂ \\n \\n      But Hermione had a steely glint in her \\neye not unlike the one Professor McGonagall sometimes \\nhad.  \\n      ﬁThe potion will be useless without Crabbe\\n™s and Goyle™s hair,ﬂ she said sternly. ﬁYou do want \\nto investigate Malfoy, don™t you?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁOh, all right, all right,ﬂ said Harry. ﬁBut what about you? Whose hair are you ripping out?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁI™ve already got mine!ﬂ said Hermione\\n brightly, pulling a tiny bottle out of her pocket and showing them the single hair inside it. ﬁRemember Millicent Bulstr\\node wrestling with me at the \\nDueling Club? She left this on my robes when \\nshe was trying to strangle me! And she™s gone \\nhome for Christmas Š so I™ll just have to tell \\nthe Slytherins I™ve decided to come back.ﬂ \\n \\n      When Hermione had bustled off to check on the Polyjuice Potion again, Ron turned to Harry \\nwith a doom-laden expression.  \\n      ﬁHave you ever heard of a plan where so many things could go wrong?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      But to Harry™s and Ron™s utter amazement, \\nstage one of the operation went just as smoothly as \\nHermione had said. They lurked in the deserted\\n entrance hall after Christmas tea, waiting for \\nCrabbe and Goyle who had remained alone at\\n the Slytherin table, shoveling down fourth helpings of trifle. Harry had perched the chocolate cakes on the e\\nnd of the banisters. When they spotted Crabbe and Goyle coming out of the Grea\\nt Hall, Harry and Ron hid quickly behind a suit of armor next to the front door. \\n \\n      ﬁHow thick can you get?ﬂ \\nRon whispered ecstatically as Crabbe gleefully pointed out the cakes to Goyle and grabbed them. Gri\\nnning stupidly, they stuffed the cakes whole into their large mouths. For a moment, both of them chewed gree\\ndily, looks of triumph on their faces. Then, \\nwithout the smallest change of\\n expression, they both keeled over backward onto the floor.  \\n      By far the hardest part was hiding them in the closet across the hall. Once they were safely \\nstowed among the buckets and mops, Harry yanked\\n out a couple of the bristles that covered Goyle™s forehead and Ron pulled out several of Crabbe™s hairs. They also stole their shoes, \\nbecause their own were far too small for Crabbe - \\nand Goyle-size feet. Then, still stunned at what \\nthey had just done, they sprinted up to Moaning Myrtle™s bathroom. \\n       They could hardly see for the thick black smoke issuing from the stall in which Hermione was \\nstirring the cauldron. Pulling their robes up over \\ntheir faces, Harry and Ron knocked softly on the door.  \\n      ﬁHermione?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      They heard the scrape of the lock and Hermione emerged, shiny-faced and looking anxious. \\nBehind her they heard the gloop gloop of the bubbling, glutinous potion. Three glass tumblers \\nstood ready on the toilet seat.  \\n      ﬁDid you get them?ﬂ Hermione asked breathlessly. \\n\\n \\n      Harry showed her Goyle™s hair. \\n \\n      ﬁGood. And I sneaked these spare robes out of the laundry,ﬂ Hermione said, holding up a small \\nsack. ﬁYou™ll need bigger sizes once you™re Crabbe and Goyle.ﬂ  \\n      The three of them stared into the cau\\nldron. Close up, the potion l\\nooked like thick, dark mud, \\nbubbling sluggishly.  \\n      ﬁI™m sure I™ve done everything right,ﬂ said \\nHermione, nervously rereading the splotched page of \\nMoste Potente Potions. ﬁIt looks like the book says it should– once we™ve drunk it, we™ll have exactly an hour before we change back into ourselves.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁNow what?ﬂ Ron whispered. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁWe separate it into \\nthree glasses and add the hairs.ﬂ \\n \\n      Hermione ladled large do\\nllops of the potion into each of the \\nglasses. Then, her hand trembling, \\nshe shook Millicent Bulstrode™s hair out of its bottle into the first glass.  \\n      The potion hissed loudly like a boiling kettle and frothed madly. A sec\\nond later, it had turned a sick sort of yellow.  \\n      ﬁUrgh Š essence of Millicent Bulstrode,ﬂ \\nsaid Ron, eyeing it with loathing. ﬁBet it tastes \\ndisgusting.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁAdd yours, then,ﬂ said Hermione. \\n\\n \\n      Harry dropped Goyle™s hair into the middle \\nglass and Ron put Crabbe™s into the last one. Both glasses hissed and frothed: Goyle™s turned the khaki color of a booger, Crabbe™s a dark, murky \\nbrown.       ﬁHang on,ﬂ said Harry as Ron and Hermione \\nreached for their glasses. ﬁWe™d better not all drink \\nthem in here– Once we turn into Crabbe and G\\noyle we won™t fit. And Millicent Bulstrode™s no \\npixie.ﬂ        ﬁGood thinking,ﬂ said Ron, unlocking the door. ﬁWe™ll take separate stalls.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      Careful not to spill a drop of his Polyjuice Potion, Harry slipped into the middle stall. \\n \\n      ﬁReady?ﬂ he called. \\n \\n      ﬁReady,ﬂ came Ron™s and Hermione™s voices. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁOne Š two Š three Šﬂ \\n \\n      Pinching his nose, Harry drank the potion \\ndown in two large gulps. It tasted like overcooked cabbage.  \\n      Immediately, his insides started writhing \\nas though he™d just swallowed live snakes Š doubled \\nup, he wondered whether he was going to be sick Š then a burning sensation spread rapidly from his stomach to the very ends of his fingers\\n and toes Š next, bringing him gasping to all \\nfours, came a horrible melting f\\neeling, as the skin all over his body bubbled like hot wax Š and before his eyes, his hands began to grow, the fingers thickened, the nails broadened, the knuckles were bulging like bolts Š his shoulders stretched painfully and a prickling on his forehead told him that hair was creeping down \\ntoward his eyebrows Š his robes ripped as his chest expanded like a barrel bursting its hoops Š his feet were agony in shoes four sizes too small. \\n \\n      As suddenly as it had started, everything \\nstopped. Harry lay facedown on the stone-cold floor, \\nlistening to Myrtle gurgling morosely in the end \\ntoilet. With difficulty, he kicked off his shoes \\nand stood up. So this was what it felt like, being Goyle. His large hand trembling, he pulled off \\nhis old robes, which were hanging a foot above his ankles, pulled on the spare ones, and laced up Goyle™s boatlike shoes. He reached up to brush hi\\ns hair out of his eyes and met only the short \\ngrowth of wiry bristles, low on his forehead. Then he realized that his glasses were clouding his eyes because Goyle obviously didn™t need them Š he took them off and called, ﬁAre you two \\n\\nokay?ﬂ Goyle™s low rasp of a voice issued from his mouth. \\n \\n      ﬁYeah,ﬂ came the deep gr\\nunt of Crabbe from his right.  \\n      Harry unlocked his door and stepped in front of the cracked mirror. Goyl\\ne stared back at him out \\nof dull, deep-set eyes. Harry scratched his ear. So did Goyle.  \\n      Ron™s door opened. They stared at each othe\\nr. Except that he looked pale and shocked, Ron was \\nindistinguishable from Crabbe, from the \\npudding-bowl haircut to the long, gorilla arms. \\n \\n      ﬁThis is unbelievable,ﬂ said Ron, approaching the mirror and prodding Crabbe™s flat nose. \\nﬁUnbelievable.ﬂ \\n       ﬁWe™d better get going,ﬂ \\nsaid Harry, loosening the watch that was cutting into Goyle™s thick \\nwrist. ﬁWe™ve still got to find out where the \\nSlytherin common room is. I only hope we can find \\nsomeone to follow–ﬂ \\n \\n      Ron, who had been gazing at Harry, said, ﬁYou don™t know how bizarre it is to see Goyle thinking.ﬂ He banged on Hermione™s \\ndoor. ﬁC™mon, we need to go Šﬂ \\n \\n      A high-pitched voice answered him. \\n \\n      ﬁI Š I don™t think I™m going to come after all. You go on without me.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁHermione, we know Millicent Bulstr\\node™s ugly, no one™s going to know it™s you Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁNo Š really Š I don™t think I™ll come. You two hu\\nrry up, you™re wasting time Šﬂ \\n \\n      Harry looked at Ron, bewildered. \\n \\n      ﬁThat looks more like Goyle,ﬂ said Ron. ﬁT\\nhat™s how he looks every time a teacher asks him a \\nquestion.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁHermione, are you oka\\ny?ﬂ said Harry through the door.  \\n      ﬁFine Š I™m fine Š go on Šﬂ \\n\\n \\n      Harry looked at his watch. Five of their precious sixty minutes had already passed.  \\n      ﬁWe™ll meet you back here, all right?ﬂ he said. \\n\\n \\n      Harry and Ron opened the door of the bathroom carefully, checked that the coast was clear, and set off. \\n \\n      ﬁDon™t swing your arms like that,ﬂ Harry muttered to Ron. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁEh?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁCrabbe holds them sort of stiff–ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁHow™s this?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁYeah, that™s better–ﬂ \\n \\n      They went down the marble staircase. A\\nll they needed now was a Sl\\nytherin that they could follow to the Slytherin common room, but there was nobody around.  \\n      ﬁAny ideas?ﬂ muttered Harry. \\n       ﬁThe Slytherins always come up to breakfa\\nst from over there,ﬂ said Ron, nodding at the entrance \\nto the dungeons. The words had barely left his mouth when a girl with long, curly hair emerged \\nfrom the entrance. \\n \\n      ﬁExcuse me,ﬂ said Ron, hurrying up to he\\nr. ﬁWe™ve forgotten the way to our common room.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁI beg your pardon?ﬂ said the girl stiffly. ﬁOur common room? I™m a Ravenclaw.ﬂ \\n \\n      She walked away, looking suspiciously back at them. \\n \\n      Harry and Ron hurried down the stone steps into the darkness, their footsteps echoing \\nparticularly loudly as Crabbe™s and Goyle™s huge feet hit the floor, feeling that this wasn™t going \\nto be as easy as they had hoped.  \\n      The labyrinthine passages were deserted. They walked deeper and deeper under the school, constantly checking their watches to see how much time they had le\\nft. After a quarter of an hour, just when they were getting desperate, they heard a sudden movement ahead. \\n \\n      ﬁHa!ﬂ said Ron excitedly. ﬁThere™s one of them now!ﬂ  \\n      The figure was emerging from a side room. As \\nthey hurried nearer, however, their hearts sank. It wasn™t a Slytherin, it was Percy.  \\n      ﬁWhat™re you doing down \\nhere?ﬂ said Ron in surprise. \\n       Percy looked affronted.  \\n      ﬁThat,ﬂ he said stiffly, ﬁis none of your business. It™s Crabbe, isn™t it?ﬂ  \\n      ﬁWh Š oh, yeah,ﬂ said Ron. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁWell, get off to your dormitories,ﬂ sa\\nid Percy sternly. ﬁIt™s not safe to go wandering around dark corridors these days.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁYou are,ﬂ Ron pointed out. \\n \\n      ﬁI,ﬂ said Percy, drawing himself up, ﬁam a prefect. No\\nthing™s about to attack me.ﬂ \\n \\n      A voice suddenly echoed behind Harry and Ron. Draco Malfoy was strolling toward them, and \\nfor the first time in his life, Harry was pleased to see him. \\n \\n      ﬁThere you are,ﬂ he drawled, looking at them. ﬁHave you two been pigging out in the Great Hall \\nall this time? I™ve been l\\nooking for you; I want to show you something really funny.ﬂ \\n \\n      Malfoy glanced witheringly at Percy. \\n       ﬁAnd what™re you doing down here, Weasley?ﬂ he sneered. \\n\\n \\n      Percy looked outraged. \\n \\n      ﬁYou want to show a bit more respect to a \\nschool prefect!ﬂ he said. ﬁI don™t like your attitude!ﬂ \\n \\n      Malfoy sneered and motioned for Harry and Ron to follow him. Harry almost said something \\napologetic to Percy but caught himself just in time. He and R\\non hurried after Malfoy, who said as they turned into the next \\npassage, ﬁThat Peter Weasley Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁPercy,ﬂ Ron corrected him automatically. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁWhatever,ﬂ said Malfoy. ﬁI™ve noticed hi\\nm sneaking around a lot lately. And I bet I know what \\nhe™s up to. He thinks he™s going to catch Slytherin™s heir single-handed.ﬂ  \\n      He gave a short, derisive laugh. Harry and Ron exchanged excited looks. \\n \\n      Malfoy paused by a stretch of bare, damp stone wall. \\n \\n      ﬁWhat™s the new passwo\\nrd again?ﬂ he said to Harry. \\n \\n      ﬁEr Šﬂ said Harry. \\n \\n      ﬁOh, yeah Š pure-blood!ﬂ said Malfoy, not listening, and a stone door concealed in the wall slid open. Malfoy marched through it, an\\nd Harry and Ron followed him. \\n \\n      The Slytherin common room was a long, \\nlow underground room with rough stone walls and \\nceiling from which round, greenish lamps were ha\\nnging on chains. A fire was crackling under an elaborately carved mantelpiece ahead of them, a\\nnd several Slytherins were silhouetted around it in high-backed chairs. \\n \\n      ﬁWait here,ﬂ said Malfoy \\nto Harry and Ron, motioning them to a pair of empty chairs set back \\nfrom the fire. ﬁI™ll go and get it my\\n father™s just sent it to me Šﬂ \\n \\n      Wondering what Malfoy was going to show \\nthem, Harry and Ron sat \\ndown, doing their best to look at home. \\n \\n      Malfoy came back a minute later, holding \\nwhat looked like a newspaper clipping. He thrust it under Ron™s nose.  \\n      ﬁThat™ll give you a laugh,ﬂ he said. \\n \\n      Harry saw Ron™s eyes widen in shock. He read the clipping quickly, gave a very forced laugh, \\nand handed it to Harry.       It had been clipped out of the \\nDaily Prophet, and it said: \\n \\n    INQUIRY AT THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC  \\n      Arthur Weasley, Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office, was today fined fifty Galleons for bewitching a Muggle car.  \\n      Mr. Lucius Malfoy, a governor of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where the enchanted car crashed earlier this year, called today for Mr. Weasley™s resignation. ﬁWeasley has brought the Ministry into disrepute,ﬂ Mr. Ma\\nlfoy told our reporter. ﬁHe is clearly unfit to \\ndraw up our laws and his ridiculous Muggle Protection Act should be scrapped immediately.ﬂ  \\n      Mr. Weasley was unavailable for comment, although his wife told reporte\\nrs to clear off or she™d set the family ghoul on them.  \\n      ﬁWell?ﬂ said Malfoy impatiently as Harry \\nhanded the clipping back to him. ﬁDon™t you think it™s \\nfunny?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁHa, ha,ﬂ said Harry bleakly. \\n \\n      ﬁArthur Weasley loves Muggles so much he \\nshould snap his wand in half and go and join them,ﬂ said Malfoy scornfully. ﬁYou™d never know the Weasleys were pure-bloods, the way they \\n\\nbehave.ﬂ  \\n      Ron™s Š or rather, Crabbe\\n™s Š face was contorted with fury. \\n \\n      ﬁWhat™s up with you, Crabbe?ﬂ snapped Malfoy. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁStomachache,ﬂ Ron grunted. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁWell, go up to the hospital wing and give\\n all those Mudbloods a kick from me,ﬂ said Malfoy, \\nsnickering. ﬁYou know, I™m surprised the Daily Prophe\\nt hasn™t reported all these attacks yet,ﬂ he went on thoughtfully. ﬁI suppose Dumbledore™s trying to hush it all up. He™ll be sacked if it \\n\\ndoesn™t stop soon. Father™s always said old Dumbledore™s the worst \\nthing that™s ever happened to this place. He loves Muggle-borns. A decent headmaster would never™ve let slime like that \\n\\nCreevey in.ﬂ  \\n      Malfoy started taking pictures with an imaginary camera and did a cruel but accurate impression \\nof Colin: ﬁ‚Potter, can I have your picture, Potter? Can I have \\nyour autograph? Can I lick your \\nshoes, please, Potter?ﬂ™ \\n \\n      He dropped his hands and looked at Harry and Ron.  \\n      ﬁWhat™s the matter with you two?ﬂ \\n\\n       Far too late, Harry and Ron forced themselves to laugh, but Malfoy seemed satisfied; perhaps \\nCrabbe and Goyle were always slow on the uptake. \\n       ﬁSaint Potter, the Mudbloods™ friend,ﬂ sa\\nid Malfoy slowly. ﬁHe™s another one with no proper wizard feeling, or he wouldn™t go around with that jumped up Granger Mudblood. And people \\nthink he™s Slytherin™s heir!ﬂ  \\n      Harry and Ron waited with bated breath: \\nMalfoy was surely seconds away from telling them it \\nwas him Š but then ﬁI wish I knew who it is,ﬂ \\nsaid Malfoy petulantly. \\nﬁI could help them.ﬂ \\n \\n      Ron™s jaw dropped so that Crabbe looked even more clueless than usual. Fortunately, Malfoy \\ndidn™t notice, and Harry, thinking fast, said, ﬁYou must have some idea who™s behind it all–ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁYou know I haven™t, Goyle, how many \\ntimes do I have to tell you?ﬂ snapped Malfoy. ﬁAnd \\nFather won™t tell me anything about the last tim\\ne the Chamber was opened either. Of course, it \\nwas fifty years ago, so it was before his time, but \\nhe knows all about it, and he says that it was all kept quiet and it™ll look suspicious if I know too much about it. But I know one thing Š last time \\nthe Chamber of Secrets was opened, a Mudblood died. \\nSo I bet it™s a matter of time before one of \\nthem™s killed this time– I hope it™s\\n Granger,ﬂ he said with relish.  \\n      Ron was clenching Crabbe™s gigantic fists. Feeling that it would be a bit of a giveaway if Ron punched Malfoy, Harry shot him a warning l\\nook and said, ﬁD™you know if the person who \\nopened the Chamber last time was caught?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁOh, yeah– whoever it was was expelled,ﬂ said Malfoy. ﬁThey™re probably still in Azkaban.ﬂ        ﬁAzkaban?ﬂ said Harry, puzzled. \\n \\n      ﬁAzkaban Š the wizard prison, Goyle,ﬂ said Malfoy, looking at him in disbelief ﬁHonestly, if \\nyou were any slower, you™d be going backward.ﬂ \\n \\n      He shifted restlessly in his chair and said, ﬁFather says to k\\neep my head down and let the Heir of \\nSlytherin get on with it. He says the school needs ridding of all th\\ne Mudblood filth, but not to get \\nmixed up in it. Of course, he™s got a lot on his \\nplate at the moment. You \\nknow the Ministry of Magic raided our manor last week?ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry tried to force Goyle™s dull face into a look of concern.  \\n      ﬁYeah–ﬂ said Malfoy. ﬁLuckily, they didn™t find much. Father\\n™s got some very valuable Dark \\nArts stuff. But luckily, we™ve got our own secr\\net chamber under the drawing-room floor Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁHo!ﬂ said Ron. \\n \\n      Malfoy looked at him. So did Harry. Ron blushed. Even his hair was turning red. His nose was also slowly lengthening Š their hour was up, Ron was turning back into himself, and from the \\nlook of horror he was suddenly giving Harry, he must be, too.        They both jumped to their feet. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁMedicine for my stomach,ﬂ Ron grunted, and \\nwithout further ado they sprinted the length of the Slytherin common room, hurled themselves at the \\nstone wall, and dashed up the passage, hoping against hope that Malfoy hadn™t noticed anything. Harry could feel his feet slipping around in Goyle™s huge shoes and had to hoist up his robes as he shrank; they crashed up the steps into the dark entrance hall, which was full of a muff\\nled pounding coming from the closet where they™d \\nlocked Crabbe and Goyle. Leaving their shoes outside the closet door, they sprinted in their socks up the marble staircase towa\\nrd Moaning Myrtle™s bathroom. \\n \\n      ﬁWell, it wasn™t a complete waste of tim\\ne,ﬂ Ron panted, closing the \\nbathroom door behind them. \\nﬁI know we still haven™t found out who™s doing the attacks, but I™m going to write to Dad \\ntomorrow and tell him to check under the Malfoys™ drawing room.ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry checked his face in the cracked mirror.\\n He was back to normal. He put his glasses on as \\nRon hammered on the door of Hermione™s stall. \\n \\n      ﬁHermione, come out,\\n we™ve got loads to tell you Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁGo away!ﬂ Hermione squeaked. \\n\\n \\n      Harry and Ron looked at each other. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁWhat™s the matter?ﬂ said Ron. ﬁYou must be back to normal by now, we are.ﬂ \\n\\n       But Moaning Myrtle glided suddenly through the stall door. Harry had never seen her looking so happy.        ﬁOoooooh, wait till you see,ﬂ she said. ﬁIt™s awful Šﬂ \\n\\n \\n      They heard the lock slide back and Hermione emerged, sobbing, her robes pulled up over her \\nhead.  \\n      ﬁWhat™s up?ﬂ said Ron uncertainly. ﬁHav\\ne you still got Millicent™s nose or something?ﬂ \\n \\n      Hermione let her robes fall and Ron backed into the sink. \\n\\n \\n      Her face was covered in black fur. Her eyes\\n had turned yellow and there were long, pointed ears \\npoking through her hair.  \\n      ﬁIt was a c-cat hair!ﬂ she howled. ﬁM-Millicent Bulstrode m-must ha\\nve a cat! And the p-potion isn™t supposed to be used for animal transformations!ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁUh-oh,ﬂ said Ron. \\n       ﬁYou™ll be teased someth\\ning dreadful,ﬂ said Myrtle happily.        ﬁIt™s okay, Hermione,ﬂ said Harry quick\\nly. ﬁWe™ll take you up to the hospital wing. Madam \\nPomfrey never asks too many questions–ﬂ \\n \\n      It took a long time to persuade Hermione to\\n leave the bathroom. Moaning Myrtle sped them on \\ntheir way with a hearty guffaw. ﬁWait ti\\nll everyone finds out you™ve got a tail!ﬂ  \\n          \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n CHAPTER THIRTEEN   The Very Secret Diary \\n  \\n  Hermione remained in the hospital wing for se\\nveral weeks. There was a flurry of rumor about \\nher disappearance when the rest of the school arrived back from their Christmas holidays, \\nbecause of course everyone thought that she had \\nbeen attacked. So many \\nstudents filed past the \\nhospital wing trying to catch a glimpse of her \\nthat Madam Pomfrey took out her curtains again \\nand placed them around Hermione™s bed, to spare her the shame of being seen with a furry face. \\n \\n      Harry and Ron went to visit her every evening. When the new term\\n started, they brought her each day™s homework. \\n \\n      ﬁIf I™d sprouted whiskers, I™d take a break from work,ﬂ said Ron, tipping a stack of books onto \\nHermione™s bedside table one evening. \\n \\n      ﬁDon™t be silly, Ron, I™ve got to keep up,ﬂ said Hermione briskly. \\nHer spirits were greatly improved by the fact that all the hair had gone fr\\nom her face and her eyes were turning slowly \\nback to brown. ﬁI don™t suppose you™ve got any new leads?ﬂ she added in a whisper, so that \\nMadam Pomfrey couldn™t hear her. \\n \\n      ﬁNothing,ﬂ said Harry gloomily. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁI was so sure it was Malfoy,ﬂ said Ron, for about the hundredth time. \\n\\n       ﬁWhat™s that?ﬂ asked Harry, pointing to \\nsomething gold sticking out from under Hermione™s \\npillow.        ﬁJust a get well card,ﬂ said Hermione hast\\nily, trying to poke it out of sight, but Ron was too quick for her. He pulled it out, flicked it open, and read aloud:    ﬁTo Miss Granger, wishing you a speedy recovery, from your concerned teacher, Professor Gilderoy Lockhart, Order of Merlin, Third Class, Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defense League, and five-time winner of Witch Weekly™s Most Charming Smile Award.ﬂ \\n \\n      Ron looked up at Hermione, disgusted. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁYou sleep with this under your pillow?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      But Hermione was spared answering by \\nMadam Pomfrey sweeping over\\n with her evening dose of medicine. \\n \\n      ﬁIs Lockhart the smarmiest bloke you™ve ever \\nmet, or what?ﬂ Ron said to Harry as they left the \\ninfirmary and started up the stai\\nrs toward Gryffindor Tower. \\n       Snape had given them so much homework, Ha\\nrry thought he was likely to be in the sixth year before he finished it. Ron was just saying he wished he had asked Hermione how many rat tails \\nyou were supposed to add to a Hair Raising Potion when an angry outburst from the floor above \\nreached their ears.  \\n      ﬁThat™s Filch,ﬂ Harry muttered as they hur\\nried up the stairs and paused, out of sight, listening hard.  \\n      ﬁYou don™t think someone else™s been attacked?ﬂ said Ron tensely. \\n\\n \\n      They stood still, their heads inclined toward Flich™s voice, which sounded quite hysterical.  \\n      ﬁEven more work for me! Mopping all night, lik\\ne I haven™t got enough to do! No, this is the final straw, I™m going to Dumbledore Šﬂ \\n \\n      His footsteps receded along the out-of-sight corridor and they heard a distant door slam. \\n \\n      They poked their heads around the corner. Filch had clearly been manning his usual lookout \\npost: They were once again on the spot where Mrs. Norris had been attacked. They saw at a glance what Filch had been shouting about. A great flood of water stretched over half the corridor, and it looked as though it was still seeping from unde\\nr the door of Moaning Myrtle™s bathroom. Now that Filch had stopped shouting, they\\n could hear Myrtle™s wails echoing off the bathroom walls. \\n \\n      ﬁNow what™s up with her?ﬂ said Ron. \\n\\n       ﬁLet™s go and see,ﬂ said Harry, and holding their robes over their ankles they stepped through the great wash of water to the door bearing its OUT OF ORDER sign, ignored it as always, and entered.        Moaning Myrtle was crying, if possible, louder and harder than ever before. She seemed to be \\nhiding down her usual toilet. It was dark in \\nthe bathroom because the candles had been \\nextinguished in the great rush of water that\\n had left both walls and floor soaking wet. \\n \\n      ﬁWhat™s up, Myrtle?ﬂ said Harry. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁWho™s that?ﬂ glugged Myrtle misera\\nbly. ﬁCome to throw something else at me?ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry waded across to her stall and said, ﬁWhy would I throw something at you?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁDon™t ask me,ﬂ Myrtle shouted, emerging with\\n a wave of yet more water, which splashed onto \\nthe already sopping floor. ﬁHere I am, minding my \\nown business, and someone thinks it™s funny to throw a book at me–ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁBut it can™t hurt you if someone throws something at you,ﬂ said Harry, reasonably. ﬁI mean, it™d \\njust go right through you, wouldn™t it?ﬂ       He had said the wrong thing. Myrtle puffed herself up and shrieked, ﬁLet™s all throw books at \\nMyrtle, because she can™t feel it! Ten points if you can get it through her stomach! Fifty points if \\nit goes through her head! We\\nll, ha, ha, ha! What a lovely game, I don™t think!ﬂ \\n       ﬁWho threw it at you, anyway?ﬂ asked Harry. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁI don™t know– I was just sitting in the U-bend, thinking about death, and it fell right through the top of my head,ﬂ said Myrtle, glaring at them. ﬁIt™s over there, it got washed out–ﬂ  \\n      Harry and Ron looked under the sink where Myrtle was pointing. A small, thin book lay there. It \\nhad a shabby black cover and was as wet as everything else in the bathroom. Harry stepped \\nforward to pick it up, but Ron suddenly flung out an arm to hold him back. \\n \\n      ﬁWhat?ﬂ said Harry. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁAre you crazy?ﬂ said Ron. ﬁIt could be dangerous.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁDangerous?ﬂ said Harry, laughing. \\nﬁCome off it, how could it be dangerous?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁYou™d be surprised,ﬂ said Ron, who was looking apprehensively at the book. ﬁSome of the \\nbooks the Ministry™s confiscated Dad™s told me \\nŠ there was one that burned your eyes out. And everyone who read Sonnets of a Sorcerer spoke in \\nlimericks for the rest of their lives. And some \\nold witch in Bath had a book that you could never stop reading! You just had to wander around with your nose in it, trying to do everything one-handed. And Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁAll right, I™ve got the point,ﬂ said Harry.  \\n      The little book lay on the floor, nondescript and soggy.  \\n      ﬁWell, we won™t find out unless we look at\\n it,ﬂ he said, and he ducked around Ron and picked it up off the floor. \\n \\n      Harry saw at once that it was a diary, and the faded year on the cover told him it was fifty years \\nold. He opened it eagerly. On the first page he could just make out the name ﬁT M. Riddleﬂ in \\n\\nsmudged ink. \\n \\n      ﬁHang on,ﬂ said Ron, who had approached cautiously and was looking over Harry™s shoulder. ﬁI know that name– T. M. Riddle got an award for sp\\necial services to the school fifty years ago.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁHow on earth d™you know that?ﬂ said Harry in amazement. \\n \\n      ﬁBecause Filch made me polish his shield ab\\nout fifty times in detention,ﬂ said Ron resentfully. \\nﬁThat was the one I burped slugs all over. If you™d wiped slime off a name for an hour, you™d \\nremember it, too.ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry peeled the wet pages apart. They were\\n completely blank. There wasn™t the faintest trace of \\nwriting on any of them, not even Auntie Mabel™\\ns birthday, or dentist, half-past three. \\n       ﬁHe never wrote in it,ﬂ said Harry, disappointed. \\n \\n      ﬁI wonder why someone wanted to flush it away?ﬂ said Ron curiously. \\n\\n \\n      Harry turned to the back cover of th\\ne book and saw the printed name of a variety store on \\nVauxhall Road, London.  \\n      ﬁHe must™ve been Muggle-born,ﬂ said \\nHarry thoughtfully. ﬁTo have bought a diary from \\nVauxhall Road–ﬂ  \\n      ﬁWell, it™s not much use to you,ﬂ said R\\non. He dropped his voice. ﬁFifty\\n points if you can get it through Myrtle™s nose.ﬂ  \\n      Harry, however, pocketed it. \\n \\n      Hermione left the hospital wing, de-whisk\\nered, tail-less, and furfree, at the beginning of February. On her first evening b\\nack in Gryffindor Tower, Harry showed her T. M. Riddle™s diary and told her the story of how they had found it.  \\n      ﬁOooh, it might have hidden powers,ﬂ said \\nHermione enthusiastica\\nlly, taking the diary and looking at it closely.  \\n      ﬁIf it has, it™s hiding them very well,\\nﬂ said Ron. ﬁMaybe it™s shy. I don™t know why you don™t chuck it, Harry.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁI wish I knew why someone did try to \\nchuck it,ﬂ said Harry. ﬁI wouldn™t mind knowing how \\nRiddle got an award for special services to Hogwarts either.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁCould™ve been anything,ﬂ said Ron. ﬁMaybe he got thirty O.W.L.s or saved a teacher from the \\ngiant squid. Maybe he murdered Myrtle; that would™ve done everyone a favor–ﬂ  \\n      But Harry could tell from the arrested look on Hermione™s face that she was thinking what he \\nwas thinking.  \\n      ﬁWhat?ﬂ said Ron, looking from one to the other. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁWell, the Chamber of Secrets was opened \\nfifty years ago, wasn™t it?ﬂ he said. ﬁThat™s what Malfoy said.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁYeah–ﬂ said Ron slowly. \\n \\n      ﬁAnd this diary is fifty years old,ﬂ said Hermione, tapping it excitedly. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁSo?ﬂ \\n      ﬁOh, Ron, wake up,ﬂ snapped Hermione. \\nﬁWe know the person who opened the Chamber last \\ntime was expelled fifty years ago. We\\n know T. M. Riddle got an award for special services to the school fifty years ago. Well, what if Riddle got his special award for catching the Heir of Slytherin? His diary would pr\\nobably tell us everything Š where the Chamber is, and how to \\nopen it, and what sort of creature lives in it Š the person who™s behind the attacks this time \\nwouldn™t want that lying around, would they?ﬂ        ﬁThat™s a brilliant theory, Hermione,ﬂ said\\n Ron, ﬁwith just one tiny li\\nttle flaw. There™s nothing written in his diary.ﬂ  \\n      But Hermione was pulling her wand out of her bag. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁIt might be invisible ink!ﬂ she whispered. \\n\\n \\n      She tapped the diary three times and said, \\nﬁAparecium!ﬂ  \\n      Nothing happened. Undaunted, Hermione shove\\nd her hand back into her bag and pulled out what appeared to be a bright red eraser. \\n \\n      ﬁIt™s a Revealer, I got it in Diagon Alley,ﬂ she said. \\n \\n      She rubbed hard on January first. Nothing happened. \\n \\n      ﬁI™m telling you, there™s nothing to find in\\n there,ﬂ said Ron. ﬁRiddle just got a diary for Christmas and couldn™t be bothered filling it in.ﬂ \\n       Harry couldn™t explain, even to himself, w\\nhy he didn™t just throw Riddle™s diary away. The fact \\nwas that even though he knew the diary was blank, he kept absentmindedly picking it up and \\nturning the pages, as though it were a story he wa\\nnted to finish. And while Harry was sure he had never heard the name T. M. Riddle before, it still \\nseemed to mean something to him, almost as \\nthough Riddle was a friend he™d had when he was very small, and had half-forgotten. But this \\nwas absurd. He™d never had friends before Hogwarts, Dudley had made sure of that. \\n \\n      Nevertheless, Harry was determined to fi\\nnd out more about Riddle, so\\n next day at break, he headed for the trophy room to examine Riddle™\\ns special award, accompanied by an interested \\nHermione and a thoroughly unconvinced Ron, w\\nho told them he™d seen enough of the trophy room to last him a lifetime. \\n \\n      Riddle™s burnished gold shield was tucked away in a corner cabinet. It di\\ndn™t carry details of why it had been given to him (ﬁGood thing, too, or it™d be even bigger and I™d still be polishing it,ﬂ said Ron). However, they did find Riddle™s name\\n on an old Medal for Magical Merit, and on a list of old Head Boys. \\n \\n      ﬁHe sounds like Percy,ﬂ said Ron, wrinkling his nose in disgust. ﬁPrefect, Head Boy– probably \\ntop of every class Šﬂ        ﬁYou say that like it™s a bad thing,ﬂ said Hermi\\none in a slightly hurt voice.      The sun had now begun to shine weakly on \\nHogwarts again. Inside the castle, the mood had \\ngrown more hopeful. There had been no more atta\\ncks since those on Justin and Nearly Headless Nick, and Madam Pomfrey was pleased to report\\n that the Mandrakes were becoming moody and \\nsecretive, meaning that they were fast leaving childhood. \\n \\n      ﬁThe moment their acne clears up, they™\\nll be ready for repotting again,ﬂ Harry heard her telling Filch kindly one afternoon. ﬁAnd after that, it \\nwon™t be long until we™re cutting them up and \\nstewing them. You™ll have Mrs. Norris back in no time.ﬂ \\n \\n      Perhaps the Heir of Slytherin had lost his or her nerve, thought Harry. It must be getting riskier \\nand riskier to open the Chamber of Secrets, with\\n the school so alert and suspicious. Perhaps the \\nmonster, whatever it was, was even now settling itself down to hibernate for another fifty years–   \\n      Ernie Macmillan of Hufflepuff didn™t take th\\nis cheerful view. He was still convinced that Harry \\nwas the guilty one, that he had ﬁgiven himself aw\\nayﬂ at the Dueling Club. \\nPeeves wasn™t helping matters; he kept popping up in the crowded co\\nrridors singing ﬁOh, Potter, you rotter–ﬂ now \\nwith a dance routine to match. \\n \\n      Gilderoy Lockhart seemed to think he \\nhimself had made the attacks stop. Harry overheard him \\ntelling Professor McGonagall so while the Gryffindors were lining up for Transfiguration. ﬁI don™t think there™ll be any more\\n trouble, Minerva,ﬂ he said, tapping his nose knowingly and winking. ﬁI think the Chamber has been locked for good this time. The culprit must have known \\n\\nit was only a matter of time before I caught him.\\n Rather sensible to stop now, before I came \\ndown hard on him. \\n \\n      ﬁYou know, what the school needs now is a morale-booster. Wash away the memories of last \\nterm! I won™t say any more just now, \\nbut I think I know just the thing–ﬂ  \\n      He tapped his nose again and strode off. \\n \\n      Lockhart™s idea of a morale-booster became clear at break\\nfast time on February fourteenth. \\nHarry hadn™t had much sleep because of a late-running Quidditch practice the night before, and \\n\\nhe hurried down to the Great Hall, slightly late. He thought, for a mome\\nnt, that he™d walked through the wrong doors.  \\n      The walls were all covered with large, luri\\nd pink flowers. Worse still, heart-shaped confetti was \\nfalling from the pale blue ceiling. \\nHarry went over to the Gryffindor table, where Ron was sitting looking sickened, and Hermione seemed to\\n have been overcome with giggles. \\n \\n      ﬁWhat™s going on?ﬂ Harry asked them\\n, sitting down and wiping confetti off his bacon. \\n \\n      Ron pointed to the teachers™ table, apparently too disgusted to spea\\nk. Lockhart, wearing lurid \\npink robes to match the decorati\\nons, was waving for silence. The teachers on either side of him \\nwere looking stony-faced. From where he sat, \\nHarry could see a muscle going in Professor \\nMcGonagall™s cheek. Snape looked as though someone\\n had just fed him a large beaker of Skele-\\nGro.        ﬁHappy Valentine™s Day!ﬂ Lockhart shouted. ﬁAnd may I thank \\nthe forty-six people who have so far sent me cards! Yes, I have ta\\nken the liberty of arranging this \\nlittle surprise for you all Š and it doesn™t end here!ﬂ  \\n      Lockhart clapped his hands and through the doors to the entrance hall marched a dozen surly-\\nlooking dwarfs. Not just any dwarfs, however. Lockhart had them all wearing golden wings and \\ncarrying harps.  \\n      ﬁMy friendly, card-carrying cupids!ﬂ beamed Lockhart. ﬁThey will be roving around the school \\ntoday delivering your valentines! And the fun doe\\nsn™t stop here! I™m sure my colleagues will \\nwant to enter into the spirit of the occasion! Why not ask Professor Snape to show you how to \\nwhip up a Love Potion! And while you™re at it, Professor Flitwick knows more about Entrancing Enchantments than any wizard I™ve\\n ever met, the sly old dog!ﬂ \\n \\n      Professor Flitwick buried his face in hi\\ns hands. Snape was looking as though the first person to \\nask him for a Love Potion would be force-fed poison. \\n \\n      ﬁPlease, Hermione, tell me you weren™t one of \\nthe forty-six,ﬂ said Ron as they left the Great Hall for their first lesson. Hermione suddenly became very interested in searching her bag for her \\n\\nschedule and didn™t answer.  \\n      All day long, the dwarfs kept barging into their classes to deliver valentines, to the annoyance of the teachers, and late that afternoon as the Gryffindors were walking upstairs for Charms, one of \\n\\nthe dwarfs caught up with Harry.  \\n      ﬁOy, you! ‚Arry Potter!ﬂ shouted a particularly grim-looking dwarf, elbowing people out of the \\nway to get to Harry.  \\n      Hot all over at the thought of being given a valentine in front of a line of first years, which happened to include Ginny Weasley, Harry trie\\nd to escape. The dwarf, however, cut his way \\nthrough the crowd by kicking people™s shins, and reached him before he™d gone two paces. \\n \\n      ﬁI™ve got a musical message to deliver to ‚A\\nrry Potter in person,ﬂ he said, twanging his harp in a threatening sort of way.  \\n      ﬁNot here,ﬂ Harry hissed, trying to escape. \\n \\n      ﬁStay still!ﬂ grunted the dwarf, grabbing hold of Harry™s bag and pulling him back. \\n \\n      ﬁLet me go!ﬂ Harry snarled, tugging. \\n\\n \\n      With a loud ripping noise, his bag split \\nin two. His books, wand, parchment, and quill spilled \\nonto the floor and his ink bottle smashed over everything. \\n       Harry scrambled around, trying to pick it\\n all up before the dwarf started singing, causing something of a holdup in the corridor. \\n \\n      ﬁWhat™s going on here?ﬂ came the cold, dr\\nawling voice of Draco Malfoy. Harry started stuffing \\neverything feverishly into his ripped bag, desperate to get away before Malfoy could hear his musical valentine. \\n \\n      ﬁWhat™s all this commotion?ﬂ said another familiar voice as Percy Weasley arrived. \\n\\n \\n      Losing his head, Harry tried to make a r\\nun for it, but the dwarf seized him around the knees and \\nbrought him crashing to the floor. \\n \\n      ﬁRight,ﬂ he said, sitting on Harry™s ankles. ﬁHere is your singing valentine:  \\n    His eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad, \\n\\n \\n     His hair is as dark as a blackboard, \\n\\n \\n     I wish he was mine, \\n\\n \\n  he™s really divine, \\n\\n \\n    The hero who conquered the Dark Lord \\n \\n      Harry would have given all the gold in Gringotts to evaporate on the spot. Trying valiantly to \\nlaugh along with everyone else, he got up, his feet numb from the weight of the dwarf, as Percy \\nWeasley did his best to disperse the crowd, some of wh\\nom were crying with mirth. \\n       ﬁOff you go, off you go, the bell rang five minu\\ntes ago, off to class, now,ﬂ he said, shooing some of the younger students away. ﬁAnd you, Malfoy Šﬂ  \\n      Harry, glancing over, saw Malfoy stoop and snatch up something. Leering, he showed it to \\nCrabbe and Goyle, and Harry realized that he™d got Riddle™s diary.  \\n      ﬁGive that back,ﬂ said Harry quietly. \\n \\n      ﬁWonder what Potter™s written in this?ﬂ \\nsaid Malfoy, who obviously hadn™t noticed the year on the cover and thought he had Harry™s own diary. A hush fell over the onlookers. Ginny was staring from the diary to Harry, looking terrified.  \\n      ﬁHand it over, Malfoy,ﬂ said Percy sternly. \\n \\n      ﬁWhen I™ve had a look,ﬂ said Ma\\nlfoy, waving the diary tauntingly at Harry.        Percy said, ﬁAs a school prefect Šﬂ but Harry had lost his temper. He pulled out his wand and \\nshouted, ﬁExpelliarmus!ﬂ and just as Snape had disarmed \\nLockhart, so Malfoy found the diary shooting out of his hand into the air. Ron, grinning broadly, caught it.        ﬁHarry!ﬂ said Percy loudly. ﬁNo magic in\\n the corridors. I™ll have to report this, you know!ﬂ  \\n      But Harry didn™t care, he was one-up on Malfoy, and that was worth fi\\nve points from Gryffindor any day. Malfoy was looking furious, and as Ginny passed him to enter her classroom, he yelled \\nspitefully after her, ﬁI don™t think Potter liked your valentine much!ﬂ \\n \\n      Ginny covered her face with her hands and ran into class. Snarling, Ron pulled out his wand, too, \\nbut Harry pulled him away. Ron didn™t need to\\n spend the whole of Charms belching slugs. \\n \\n      It wasn™t until they had reached Professor \\nFlitwick™s class that Harry noticed something rather \\nodd about Riddle™s diary. All his other books were drenched in scarlet ink. The diary, however, was as clean as it had been before the ink bottle had smashed all over it. He tried to point this out \\nto Ron, but Ron was having trouble with his wand again; large purple bubbles were blossoming \\nout of the end, and he wasn™t mu\\nch interested in anything else.  \\n      Harry went to bed before anyone else in hi\\ns dormitory that night. This was partly because he \\ndidn™t think he could stand Fred and George singing, ﬁHis eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toadﬂ one more time, and partly because he wa\\nnted to examine Riddle™\\ns diary again, and knew that Ron thought he was wasting his time. \\n \\n      Harry sat on his four-poster and flicked through the blank pages, not one of which had a trace of \\nscarlet ink on it. Then he pulled a new bottle ou\\nt of his bedside cabinet, dipped his quill into it, \\nand dropped a blot onto the first page of the diary.  \\n      The ink shone brightly on the paper for a second and then, as though it was being sucked into the page, vanished. Excited, Harry loaded up his quill a second time and wrote, ﬁMy name is Harry \\nPotter.ﬂ \\n \\n      The words shone momentarily on the page and they, too, sank without trace. Then, at last, \\nsomething happened. \\n \\n      Oozing back out of the page, in his very own ink, came words Harry had never written. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁHello, Harry Potter. My name is\\n Tom Riddle. How did you come by my diary?ﬂ \\n \\n      These words, too, faded away, but not before Harry had started to scribble back. \\n \\n      ﬁSomeone tried to flush it down a toilet.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      He waited eagerly for Riddle™s reply. \\n \\n      ﬁLucky that I recorded my memories in so\\nme more lasting way than ink. But I always knew that \\nthere would be those who would not want this diary read.ﬂ        ﬁWhat do you mean?ﬂ Harry scrawle\\nd, blotting the page in his excitement. \\n \\n      ﬁI mean that this diary holds memories of\\n terrible things. Things that were covered up. Things that happened at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁThat™s where I am now,ﬂ Harry wrote qui\\nckly. ﬁI™m at Hogwarts, and horrible stuff™s been \\nhappening. Do you know anything about the Chamber of Secrets?ﬂ \\n \\n      His heart was hammering. Riddle™s reply came quickly, his writing becoming untidier, as though \\nhe was hurrying to tell all he knew.  \\n      ﬁOf course I know about the Chamber of Secrets. In my day, they told us it was a legend, that it \\ndid not exist. But this was a lie. In my fifth year, the Chamber was opened and the monster \\nattacked several students, finally killing one. I caught the person who™d opened the Chamber and \\nhe was expelled. But the Headmast\\ner, Professor Dippet, ashamed th\\nat such a thing had happened at Hogwarts, forbade me to tell th\\ne truth. A story was given out that the girl had died in a freak accident. They gave me a nice, shiny, engraved \\ntrophy for my trouble and warned me to keep my \\nmouth shut. But I knew it could happen again. The monster lived on, and the one who had the \\npower to release it was not imprisoned.ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry nearly upset his ink bottle in his hurry to write back.  \\n      ﬁIt™s happening again now. There have been three attacks and no one seems to know who™s \\nbehind them. Who was it last time?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁI can show you, if you like, ﬁcame Riddle™s \\nreply. ﬁYou don™t have to take my word for it. I can \\ntake you inside my memory of the night when I caught him.ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry hesitated, his quill suspended over \\nthe diary. What did Riddle mean? How could he be \\ntaken inside somebody else™s memory? He glanced \\nnervously at the door to the dormitory, which was growing dark. When he looked back at\\n the diary, he saw fresh words forming. \\n \\n      ﬁLet me show you.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      Harry paused for a fraction of a second and then wrote two letters. \\n\\n \\n      OK \\n \\n      The pages of the diary began to blow as though caught in a high wind, stopping halfway through the month of June. Mouth hanging open, Harry saw \\nthat the little square for June thirteenth \\n\\nseemed to have turned into a miniscule television\\n screen. His hands trembling slightly, he raised the book to press his eye against the little window, and before he\\n knew what was happening, he was tilting forward; the window was widening, he \\nfelt his body leave his bed, and he was pitched headfirst through the opening in the page, into a whirl of color and shadow.       He felt his feet hit solid ground, and stood, shaking, as the blurred shapes around him came \\nsuddenly into focus.        He knew immediately where he was. This\\n circular room with the sleeping portraits was \\nDumbledore™s office Š but it wasn™t Dumbledore \\nwho was sitting behind the desk. A wizened, frail-looking wizard, bald except for a few wisps of white hair, was reading a letter by candlelight. Harry had never seen this man before. \\n \\n      ﬁI™m sorry,ﬂ he said shakily. ﬁI didn™t mean to butt in Šﬂ \\n\\n \\n      But the wizard didn™t look up. He continued to read, frowning slightly. Harry drew nearer to his desk and stammered, ﬁEr Š I™ll just go, shall I?ﬂ \\n \\n      Still the wizard ignored him. He didn™t seem even to have \\nheard him. Thinking that the wizard \\nmight be deaf, Harry raised his voice. \\n \\n      ﬁSorry I disturbed you. I™ll go now,ﬂ he half-shouted.  \\n      The wizard folded up the letter with a sigh, stood up, walked past Harry without glancing at him, \\nand went to draw the curtains at his window.  \\n      The sky outside the window was ruby-red; it seemed to be s\\nunset. The wizard went back to the desk, sat down, and twiddled his thumbs, watc\\nhing the door.  \\n      Harry looked around the office. No Fawkes the phoenix Š no whirring silver contraptions. This \\nwas Hogwarts as Riddle had known it, meaning \\nthat this unknown wizard was Headmaster, not \\nDumbledore, and he, Harry, was little more than a phantom, completely invisible to the people of \\n\\nfifty years ago.  \\n      There was a knock on the office door. \\n \\n      ﬁEnter,ﬂ said the old wizard in a feeble voice. \\n \\n      A boy of about sixteen entered, taking off his pointed hat. A silver prefect™s badge was glinting on his chest. He was much taller than\\n Harry, but he, too, had jet-black hair.  \\n      ﬁAh, Riddle,ﬂ said the Headmaster. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁYou wanted to see me, Professo\\nr Dippet?ﬂ said Riddle. He looked nervous.  \\n      ﬁSit down,ﬂ said Dippet. ﬁI™ve just been reading the \\nletter you sent me.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁOh,ﬂ said Riddle. He sat down, \\ngripping his hands together very tightly. \\n \\n      ﬁMy dear boy,ﬂ said Dipper kindly, ﬁI cannot possibly let you stay at school over the summer. \\nSurely you want to go home for the holidays?ﬂ \\n      ﬁNo,ﬂ said Riddle at once. ﬁI™d much rather stay at Hogwarts than go back to that Š to that Šﬂ \\n       ﬁYou live in a Muggle orphanage during the holidays, I believe\\n?ﬂ said Dippet curiously.  \\n      ﬁYes, sir,ﬂ said Riddle, reddening slightly. \\n \\n      ﬁYou are Muggle-born?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁHalf-blood, sir,ﬂ said Riddle. ﬁMuggle father, witch mother.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁAnd are both your parents Š?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁMy mother died just after I was born, sir. \\nThey told me at the orphanage she lived just long \\nenough to name me Š Tom after my fath\\ner, Marvolo after my grandfather.ﬂ  \\n      Dipper clucked his tongue sympathetically. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁThe thing is, Tom,ﬂ he sighed, ﬁSpecial \\narrangements might have been\\n made for you, but in the \\ncurrent circumstances–ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁYou mean all these attack\\ns, sir?ﬂ said Riddle, and Harry™s heart leapt, and he moved closer, \\nscared of missing anything. \\n \\n      ﬁPrecisely,ﬂ said the headmaster. ﬁMy dear\\n boy, you must see how foolis\\nh it would be of me to \\nallow you to remain at the castle when term ends. Particularly in light of the recent tragedy– the \\n\\ndeath of that poor little girl– You will be safer by far at your orphanage. As a matter of fact, the \\nMinistry of Magic is even now talking about closing the school. We are no nearer locating the Š \\ner Š source of all this unpleasantness–ﬂ  \\n      Riddle™s eyes had widened. \\n \\n      ﬁSir Š if the person was caught Š if it all stopped Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁWhat do you mean?ﬂ said Dippet with a squeak \\nin his voice, sitting up in his chair. ﬁRiddle, do \\nyou mean you know something about these attacks?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁNo, sir,ﬂ said Riddle quickly. \\n \\n      But Harry was sure it was the same sort\\n of ﬁnoﬂ that he hims\\nelf had given Dumbledore. \\n \\n      Dippet sank back, looking faintly disappointed. \\n \\n      ﬁYou may go, Tom–ﬂ \\n \\n      Riddle slid off his chair and slouched out of the room. Harry followed him. \\n\\n       Down the moving spiral staircase they we\\nnt, emerging next to the gargoyle in the darkening \\ncorridor. Riddle stopped, and so did Harry, watching him. Harry \\ncould tell that Riddle was doing some serious thinking. He was biting his lip, his forehead furrowed. \\n       Then, as though he had suddenly reached a \\ndecision, he hurried off, Harry gliding noiselessly \\nbehind him. They didn™t see another person until th\\ney reached the entrance hall, when a tall \\nwizard with long, sweeping auburn hair and a beard called to Riddle from the marble staircase. \\n \\n      ﬁWhat are you doing, wandering around this late, Tom?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      Harry gaped at the wizard. He was none other than a fifty-year-younger Dumbledore. \\n \\n      ﬁI had to see the headmaster, sir,ﬂ said Riddle. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁWell, hurry off to bed,ﬂ said Dumbledor\\ne, giving Riddle exactly the kind of penetrating stare Harry knew so well. ﬁBest not to roam the corridors these days. Not since–ﬂ \\n \\n      He sighed heavily, bade Riddle good night, and strode off. Riddle watched him walk out of sight \\nand then, moving quickly, headed straight down the stone steps to the dungeons, with Harry in \\nhot pursuit.  \\n      But to Harry™s disappointment, Riddle led him not into a hidden passag\\neway or a secret tunnel but to the very dungeon in which Harry had Potions with Snape. The torches hadn™t been lit, and when Riddle pushed the door almost\\n closed, Harry could only just see him, standing stock-still \\nby the door, watching the passage outside.        It felt to Harry that they were there for at least an hour. All he could see was the figure of Riddle at the door, staring through the crack, waiting lik\\ne a statue. And just when Harry had stopped \\nfeeling expectant and tense and started wishing he could return to the present, he heard something move beyond the door. \\n       Someone was creeping along the passage. \\nHe heard whoever it was pass the dungeon where he and Riddle were hidden. Riddle, quiet as a shadow, edged through the door and followed, Harry tiptoeing behind him, forgetting \\nthat he couldn™t be heard.  \\n      For perhaps five minutes they followed th\\ne footsteps, until Riddle stopped suddenly, his head inclined in the direction of new noises. Harry heard a door creak open, and then someone \\nspeaking in a hoarse whisper.  \\n      ﬁC™mon– gotta get yeh outta here– C™mon now– in the box–ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      There was something familiar about that voice–  \\n\\n \\n      Riddle suddenly jumped around the corner. Ha\\nrry stepped out behind him.\\n He could see the dark outline of a huge boy who was crouching in front \\nof an open door, a very large box next to it.        ﬁEvening, Rubeus,ﬂ said Riddle sharply.  \\n      The boy slammed the door shut and stood up. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁWhat yer doin™ down here, Tom?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      Riddle stepped closer. \\n \\n      ﬁIt™s all over,ﬂ he said. ﬁI™m going to have\\n to turn you in, Rubeus. They™re talking about closing \\nHogwarts if the at\\ntacks don™t stop.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁ‚N at d™yeh Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁI don™t think you meant to kill anyone. But monsters don™t make good pets. I suppose you just \\nlet it out for exercise and Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁIt never killed no one!ﬂ said the large boy, backing against the closed door. From behind him, \\nHarry could hear a funny rustling and clicking.  \\n      ﬁCome on, Rubeus,ﬂ said Riddle, moving ye\\nt closer. ﬁThe dead girl™s parents will be here tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do is make sure\\n that the thing that k\\nilled their daughter is slaughtered–ﬂ  \\n      ﬁIt wasn™t him!ﬂ roared the boy, his voice \\nechoing in the dark passage. ﬁHe wouldn™! He never!ﬂ  \\n      ﬁStand aside,ﬂ said Riddle, drawing out his wand. \\n       His spell lit the corridor with a sudden fl\\naming light. The door behind the large boy flew open \\nwith such force it knocked him into the wall opposite. And out of it came something that made \\n\\nHarry let out a long, piercing scream unheard by anyone. \\n \\n      A vast, low-slung, hairy body and a tangle of black legs; a gleam of many eyes and a pair of \\nrazor-sharp pincers Š Riddle raised his wand agai\\nn, but he was too late. The thing bowled him \\nover as it scuttled away, tearing up the corridor and out of sight. Riddle scrambled to his feet, \\nlooking after it; he raised his wand, but the huge boy leapt on him, seized his wand, and threw \\n\\nhim back down, yelling, ﬁNOOOOOO!ﬂ \\n \\n      The scene whirled, the darkness became comp\\nlete; Harry felt himself falling and, with a crash, \\nhe landed spread-eagled on his four-poster in the Gryffindor dormitory, Riddle™s diary lying \\nopen on his stomach. \\n \\n      Before he had had time to regain his \\nbreath, the dormitory door opened and Ron came in. \\n \\n      ﬁThere you are,ﬂ he said. \\n \\n      Harry sat up. He was sweating and shaking.       ﬁWhat™s up?ﬂ said R\\non, looking at him with concern. \\n       ﬁIt was Hagrid, Ron. Hagrid opened the Chamber of Secrets fifty years ago.ﬂ \\n \\n   \\n \\n            \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n CHAPTER FOURTEEN \\n  Cornelius Fudge  \\n  Harry, Ron, and Hermione had always known that \\nHagrid had an unfortunate liking for large and \\nmonstrous creatures. During their first year at Hogwarts he had tried to raise a dragon in his little wooden house, and it would be a long time before they forgot the giant,\\n three-headed dog he™d christened ﬁFluffy.ﬂ And if, as a boy, Hagrid had heard that a monster was hidden somewhere in \\nthe castle, Harry was sure he™d have gone to a\\nny lengths for a glimpse of it. He™d probably \\nthought it was a shame that the monster had b\\neen cooped up so long, and thought it deserved the chance to stretch its many legs; Harry could just \\nimagine the thirteen-year-old Hagrid trying to \\nfit a leash and collar on it. But he was equally certain that Hagrid would never have meant to kill \\n\\nanybody.  \\n      Harry half wished he hadn™t found out how to work Riddle™s diary. Again and again Ron and \\nHermione made him recount what he™d seen, until he\\n was heartily sick of telling them and sick of the long, circular conversations that followed.  \\n      ﬁRiddle might have got the wrong person,ﬂ said Hermi\\none. ﬁMaybe it was some other monster \\nthat was attacking people–ﬂ  \\n      ﬁHow many monsters d™you thin\\nk this place can hold?ﬂ Ron asked dully. \\n \\n      ﬁWe always knew Hagrid had been expell\\ned,ﬂ said Harry miserably. ﬁAnd the attacks must™ve \\nstopped after Hagrid was kicked out. Otherwise, Riddle wouldn™t have got his award.ﬂ  \\n      Ron tried a different tack. \\n \\n      ﬁRiddle does sound like Percy Š who asked him to squeal on Hagrid, anyway?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁBut the monster had killed someone, Ron,ﬂ said Hermione. \\n \\n      ﬁAnd Riddle was going to go back to some \\nMuggle orphanage if they closed Hogwarts,ﬂ said \\nHarry. ﬁI don™t blame him for wanting to stay here–ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁYou met Hagrid down Knockturn Alley, didn™t you, Harry?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁHe was buying a Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent,ﬂ said Harry quickly. \\n \\n      The three of them fell si\\nlent. After a long pause, Hermione voi\\nced the knottiest question of all in a hesitant voice.  \\n      ﬁDo you think we should go and ask Hagrid about it all?ﬂ  \\n      ﬁThat™d be a cheerful visit,ﬂ said Ron. ﬁ‚Hello, Hagrid. Tell us, have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?™ﬂ \\n       In the end, they decided that they would not say anything to Hagrid unless there was another attack, and as more and more days went by w\\nith no whisper from the disembodied voice, they \\nbecame hopeful that they would never need to ta\\nlk to him about why he had been expelled. It \\nwas now nearly four months since Justin and Ne\\narly Headless Nick had been Petrified, and nearly everybody seemed to think \\nthat the attacker, whoever it was, had retired for good. Peeves had finally got bored of his ﬁOh, Potter, you rotterﬂ song, Ernie Macmillan asked Harry quite \\n\\npolitely to pass a bucket of leaping toadstools in Herbology one day, and in March several of the Mandrakes threw a loud and raucous party in greenhouse three. This\\n made Professor Sprout very \\nhappy.  \\n      ﬁThe moment they start trying to move into\\n each other™s pots, we™ll know they™re fully mature,ﬂ \\nshe told Harry. ﬁThen we™ll be able to revive those poor people in the hospital wing.ﬂ \\n \\n  The second years were given something new to\\n think about during their Easter holidays. The \\ntime had come to choose their subjects for the th\\nird year, a matter that Hermione, at least, took \\nvery seriously.  \\n      ﬁ– it could affect our whole future,ﬂ she told Harry and Ron as they pored over lists of new subjects, marking th\\nem with checks. \\n \\n      ﬁI just want to give up Potions,ﬂ said Harry. \\n \\n      ﬁWe can™t,ﬂ said Ron gloomily. ﬁWe keep a\\nll our old subjects, or I™d™ve ditched Defense Against the Dark Arts.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁBut that™s very important!ﬂ said Hermione, shocked. \\n \\n      ﬁNot the way Lockhart teaches it,ﬂ said Ron. ﬁI haven™t learned anything from him except not to \\nset pixies loose.ﬂ \\n \\n      Neville Longbottom had been sent letters from all the witches and wizards in his family, all \\ngiving him different advice on what to choose. C\\nonfused and worried, he sat reading the subject lists with his tongue poking out, asking people whether they thought Arithmancy sounded more \\ndifficult than the study of Ancient Runes. Dean Thomas, who, like Harry, had grown up with \\nMuggles, ended up closing his eyes and jabbing his wand at the list, then picking the subjects it landed on. Hermione took nobody™s advi\\nce but signed up for everything.  \\n      Harry smiled grimly to himself at the thoug\\nht of what Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia would say if he tried to discuss his career in wizardry with them. Not that he\\n didn™t get any guidance: Percy Weasley was eager to share his experience. \\n \\n      ﬁDepends where you want to go, Harry,ﬂ he said. ﬁIt™s never too early to think about the future, so I™d recommend Divination. People say Muggle Studi\\nes is a soft option, but I personally think wizards should have a thorough understanding of the non-magical community, particularly if \\nthey™re thinking of working in close contact with them Š look at my father, he has to deal with \\nMuggle business all the time. My brother Charlie \\nwas always more of an outdoor type, so he went for Care of Magical Creatures. Play to your strengths, Harry.ﬂ        But the only thing Harry felt he was really\\n good at was Quidditch. In the end, he chose the same \\nnew subjects as Ron, feeling that if he was lousy at them, at least he™d have someone friendly to \\nhelp him. \\n \\n    Gryffindor™s next Quidditch match would be\\n against Hufflepuff. Wood was insisting on team \\npractices every night afte\\nr dinner, so that Harry barely had time for anything but Quidditch and \\nhomework. However, the training se\\nssions were getting better, or at least drier, and the evening \\nbefore Saturday™s match he went up to his \\ndormitory to drop off his broomstick feeling \\nGryffindor™s chances for the Quidditch cup had never been better.  \\n      But his cheerful mood didn™t last long. At th\\ne top of the stairs to the dormitory, he met Neville \\nLongbottom, who was looking frantic.  \\n      ﬁHarry Š I don™t know who did it Š I just found Šﬂ \\n \\n      Watching Harry fearfully, Neville pushed open the door. \\n\\n \\n      The contents of Harry™s trunk had been thrown everywhere. His cloak lay ripped on the floor. The bedclothes had been pulled off his four-poster and the drawer had been pulled out of his bedside cabinet, the contents strewn over the mattress. \\n \\n      Harry walked over to the bed, open-mouthed, treading on a few loose pages of Travels with \\nTrolls. As he and Neville pulled the blankets back onto his bed, Ron, Dean, and Seamus came in. \\nDean swore loudly.  \\n      ﬁWhat happened, Harry?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁNo idea,ﬂ said Harry. But Ron was examin\\ning Harry™s robes. All the pockets were hanging out.  \\n      ﬁSomeone™s been looking for someth\\ning,ﬂ said Ron. ﬁIs there anything missing?ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry started to pick up all his things and throw them into his trunk. It was only as he threw the \\nlast of the Lockhart books \\nback into it that he realized what wasn™t there. \\n \\n      ﬁRiddle™s diary™s gone,ﬂ he said in an undertone to Ron. \\n \\n      ﬁWhat?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      Harry jerked his head toward the dormitory door and Ron followed him out. They hurried down \\nto the Gryffindor common room, which was hal\\nf-empty, and joined Hermione, who was sitting \\nalone, reading a book called Ancient Runes Made Easy.        Hermione looked aghast at the news. \\n \\n      ﬁBut Š only a Gryffindor could have stolen Š nobody else knows our password Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁExactly,ﬂ said Harry. \\n \\n  They woke the next day to brillian\\nt sunshine and a light, refreshing breeze.  \\n      ﬁPerfect Quidditch conditions!ﬂ said Wood enthusiastically at\\n the Gryffindor table, loading the team™s plates with scrambled eggs. ﬁHarry, \\nbuck up there, you need a decent breakfast.ﬂ  \\n      Harry had been staring down the packed Gryffindor table, wondering if the new owner of Riddle™s diary was right in front of his eyes. Hermione had \\nbeen urging him to report the \\nrobbery, but Harry didn™t like the idea. He™d have to tell a teacher all about the diary, and how many people knew why Hagrid had been expelled fift\\ny years ago? He didn™t\\n want to be the one who brought it all up again.  \\n      As he left the Great Hall with Ron and He\\nrmione to go and collect his Quidditch things, another \\nvery serious worry was added to Harry™s growing list. He had just set foot on the marble \\nstaircase when he heard it yet again. \\n \\n      ﬁKill this time– let me rip– tear–ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      He shouted aloud and Ron and Hermione both jumped away from him in alarm. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁThe voice!ﬂ said Harry, -looking over his shoulder. ﬁI just heard it again Š didn™t you?ﬂ \\n \\n      Ron shook his head, wide-eyed. Hermi\\none, however, clapped a hand to her forehead. \\n \\n      ﬁHarry Š I think I™ve just understood something! I™ve got to\\n go to the library!ﬂ  \\n      And she sprinted away, up the stairs. \\n \\n      ﬁWhat does she understand?ﬂ said Harry dist\\nractedly, still looking around, trying to tell where the voice had come from. \\n \\n      ﬁLoads more than I do,ﬂ said Ron, shaking his head. \\n \\n      ﬁBut why™s she got to go to the library?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁBecause that™s what Hermione does,ﬂ sa\\nid Ron, shrugging. ﬁWhen in doubt, go to the library.ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry stood, irresolute, trying to catch the voice again, but people were now emerging from the \\nGreat Hall behind him, talking loudly, exiti\\nng through the front doors on their way to the Quidditch pitch.        ﬁYou™d better get moving,ﬂ said \\nRon. ﬁIt™s nearly eleven Š the match Šﬂ \\n       Harry raced up to Gryffindor Tower, collected his Nimbus Two Thousand, and joined the large \\ncrowd swarming across the grounds, but his mind wa\\ns still in the castle along with the bodiless voice, and as he pulled on his scarlet robes in the locker room, his \\nonly comfort was that everyone was now outside to watch the game. \\n \\n      The teams walked onto the field to tumu\\nltuous applause. Oliver Wood took off for a warm-up \\nflight around the goal posts; Madam Hooch released the balls. The Hufflepuffs, who played in canary yellow, were standing in a huddle, having a last-minute discussion of tactics. \\n \\n      Harry was just mounting his broom when\\n Professor McGonagall came half marching, half \\nrunning across the pitch, carrying an enormous purple megaphone. \\n \\n      Harry™s heart dropped like a stone. \\n \\n      ﬁThis match has been cancelled,ﬂ Professor McGonagall called through the megaphone, \\naddressing the packed stadium. There were boos\\n and shouts. Oliver Wo\\nod, looking devastated, landed and ran toward Professor McGonagall without getting off his broomstick. \\n \\n      ﬁBut, Professor!ﬂ he shouted. ﬁWe™ve got to play Š the cup ŠGryffindor Šﬂ  \\n      Professor McGonagall ignored him and continued to shout through her megaphone: \\n \\n      ﬁAll students are to make their way back\\n to the House common rooms, where their Heads of \\nHouses will give them further inform\\nation. As quickly as you can, please!ﬂ \\n \\n      Then she lowered the megaphone and beckoned Harry over to her. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁPotter, I think you™d better come with me–ﬂ \\n \\n      Wondering how she could possibly suspect h\\nim this time, Harry saw Ron detach himself from \\nthe complaining crowd; he came running up to them \\nas they set off toward the castle. To Harry™s surprise, Professor McGonagall didn™t object.  \\n      ﬁYes, perhaps you™d better come, too, Weasley–ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      Some of the students swarming around th\\nem were grumbling about the match being canceled; \\nothers looked worried. Harry and Ron followed Pr\\nofessor McGonagall back into the school and up the marble staircase. But they were\\nn™t taken to anybody™s office this time. \\n \\n      ﬁThis will be a bit of a shock,ﬂ said Professor McGonagall in a surprisingly gentle voice as they approached the infirmary. ﬁThere \\nhas been another attack– another double attack.ﬂ  \\n      Harry™s insides did a horrible somersault. Professor McGonagall pushed the door open and he \\nand Ron entered– Madam Pomfrey \\nwas bending over a fifth-year girl with long, curly hair. Harry recognized her as the Ravenclaw they™d acci\\ndentally asked for directions to the Slytherin common room. And on the bed next to her was Š \\n       ﬁHermione!ﬂ Ron groaned.  \\n      Hermione lay utterly still, her eyes open and glassy. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁThey were found near the library,ﬂ said Professor McGonaga\\nll. ﬁI don™t suppose either of you can explain this? It was on \\nthe floor next to them–ﬂ  \\n      She was holding up a small, circular mirror. \\n\\n \\n      Harry and Ron shook their heads, both staring at Hermione. \\n \\n      ﬁI will escort you back to Gryffindor Tower,ﬂ said Professor McGonagall heavily. ﬁI need to address the students in any case.ﬂ \\n \\n  ﬁAll students will return to their House common \\nrooms by six o™clock in the evening. No student \\nis to leave the dormitories after that time. You \\nwill be escorted to each lesson by a teacher. No \\nstudent is to use the bathroom unaccompanied \\nby a teacher. All further Quidditch training and \\nmatches are to be postponed. There \\nwill be no more evening activities.ﬂ \\n \\n      The Gryffindors packed inside the common room listened to Professo\\nr McGonagall in silence. She rolled up the parchment from which she ha\\nd been reading and said in a somewhat choked \\nvoice, ﬁI need hardly add that I have rarely been \\nso distressed. It is likely that the school will be \\nclosed unless the culprit behind these attacks is caught. I would urge anyone who thinks they might know anything about them to come forward.ﬂ \\n \\n      She climbed somewhat awkwardly out of \\nthe portrait hole, and the Gryffindors began talking immediately. \\n \\n      ﬁThat™s two Gryffindors down, not counting a Gryffindor ghost, one Ravenclaw, and one Hufflepuff, ﬁ said the Weasley twins™ friend Lee \\nJordan, counting on his fingers. ﬁHaven™t any of the teachers noticed that the Slythe\\nrins are all safe? Isn™t it obvi\\nous all this stuff™s coming from \\nSlytherin? The Heir of Slytheri\\nn, the monster of Slytherin Š why don™t they \\njust chuck all the Slytherins out?ﬂ he roared, to\\n nods and scattered applause.  \\n      Percy Weasley was sitting in a chair behind Lee, but for once he didn™t seem keen to make his \\nviews heard. He was looking pale and stunned.  \\n      ﬁPercy™s in shock,ﬂ George told Harry quietly. ﬁThat Ravenclaw girl Š Penelope Clearwater Š she™s a prefect. I don™t think he thought the monster would dare attack a prefect.ﬂ \\n \\n      But Harry was only half-listening. He didn™t seem to be able to ge\\nt rid of the picture of Hermione, lying on the hospital bed as though carv\\ned out of stone. And if the culprit wasn™t caught soon, he was looking at a lifetime back w\\nith the Dursleys. Tom Riddle had turned Hagrid \\nin because he was faced with the prospect of a Muggle orphanage if the school closed. Harry \\nnow knew exactly how he had felt.  \\n      ﬁWhat™re we going to do?ﬂ said Ron quietly \\nin Harry™s ear. ﬁD™you think they suspect Hagrid?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWe™ve got to go and talk to him,ﬂ said \\nHarry, making up his mind. ﬁI can\\n™t believe it™s him this \\ntime, but if he set the monste\\nr loose last time he™ll know how \\nto get inside the Chamber of \\nSecrets, and that™s a start.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁBut McGonagall said we™ve got to stay in our tower unless we™re in class Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁI think,ﬂ said Harry, more quietly stil\\nl, ﬁit™s time to get my \\ndad™s old cloak out again.ﬂ  \\n    Harry had inherited just one\\n thing from his father: a long and s\\nilvery Invisibility Cloak. It was their only chance of sneaking out of the school to visit Hagrid without anyone knowing about it. They went to bed at the usual time, waite\\nd until Neville, Dean, and Seamus had stopped \\ndiscussing the Chamber of Secrets and finally fa\\nllen asleep, then got up, dressed again, and threw \\nthe cloak over themselves. \\n \\n      The journey through the dark and deserted castle corridors wasn™t enjoyable. Harry, who had wandered the castle at night several times before, had never seen it so crowded after sunset. \\n\\nTeachers, prefects, and ghosts were marching \\nthe corridors in pairs, staring around for any unusual activity. Their Invisibility Cloak didn™t stop them ma\\nking any noise, and there was a particularly tense moment when Ron stubbed his \\ntoe only yards from the spot where Snape stood \\nstanding guard. Thankfully, Snape sneezed at almost\\n exactly the moment Ron swore. It was with \\nrelief that they reached the oa\\nk front doors and eased them open. \\n \\n      It was a clear, starry night. They hurried toward the lit windows of Hagrid™s house and pulled off \\nthe cloak only when they were right outside his front door.  \\n      Seconds after they had knocked, Hagrid flung it open. They found themselves face-to-face with \\nhim aiming a crossbow at them. Fang th\\ne boarhound barked loudly behind him. \\n \\n      ﬁOh,ﬂ he said, lowering the weapon and staring at them. ﬁWhat™re\\n you two doin™ here?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWhat™s that for?ﬂ said Harry, poin\\nting at the crossbow as they stepped inside.  \\n      ﬁNothin™ Š nothin™ Šﬂ Hagrid muttered. ﬁI™ve bin expectin™ Š doesn™ matter Š Sit down Š \\nI™ll make tea Šﬂ \\n \\n      He hardly seemed to know what he was \\ndoing. He nearly extinguished the fire, spilling water from the kettle on it, and then smashed the t\\neapot with a nervous jerk of his massive hand. \\n \\n      ﬁAre you okay, Hagrid?ﬂ said Harry. ﬁDid you hear about Hermione?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁOh, I heard, all righ™,ﬂ said Hagrid, a slight \\nbreak in his voice.       He kept glancing nervously at the windows. He poured them both large mugs of boiling water \\n(he had forgotten to add tea bags) and was just putting a slab of fruitcake on a plate when there was a loud knock on the door.        Hagrid dropped the fruitcake. Harry and \\nRon exchanged panicstricken looks, then threw the Invisibility Cloak back over themselves and retreated into a corner. Hagrid checked that they were hidden, seized his crossbow, and flung open his door once more. \\n \\n      ﬁGood evening, Hagrid.ﬂ \\n \\n      It was Dumbledore. He\\n entered, looking deadly serious, and was followed by a second, very odd-looking man. \\n \\n      The stranger had rumpled gray hair and an anxious expression, and was wearing a strange mixture of clothes: a pinstriped suit, a scarle\\nt tie, a long black cloak, and pointed purple boots. Under his arm he carried a lime-green bowler. \\n \\n      ﬁThat™s Dad™s boss!ﬂ Ron breathed. ﬁCornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic!ﬂ  \\n      Harry elbowed Ron hard to make him shut up. \\n\\n \\n      Hagrid had gone pale and sweaty. He dropped into one of his chairs and looked from Dumbledore to Cornelius Fudge. \\n \\n      ﬁBad business, Hagrid,ﬂ said Fudge in rather clipped tones. ﬁVery bad business. Had to come. \\nFour attacks on Muggle-borns. Things™ve gone far enough. Ministry™s got to act.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁI never,ﬂ said Hagrid, looking imploringly at Dumbledore. ﬁYou know I never, Professor \\nDumbledore, sir Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁI want it understood, Cornelius, that Hagrid has my full confidence,ﬂ said Dumbledore, \\nfrowning at Fudge.  \\n      ﬁLook, Albus,ﬂ said Fudge, uncomfortably. ﬁHag\\nrid™s record™s against him. Ministry™s got to do \\nsomething Š the school governor\\ns have been in touch Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁYet again, Cornelius, I tell you that taking \\nHagrid away will not help \\nin the slightest,ﬂ said \\nDumbledore. His blue eyes were full of\\n a fire Harry had never seen before.  \\n      ﬁLook at it from my point of view,ﬂ said \\nFudge, fidgeting with his bowler. ﬁI™m under a lot of \\npressure. Got to be seen to be doing something. If \\nit turns out it wasn™t Hagrid, he™ll be back and no more said. But I™ve got to take him. Got to. Wouldn™t be doing my duty Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁTake me?ﬂ said Hagrid, who was trembling. ﬁTake me where?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁFor a short stretch only,ﬂ said Fudge, not meeting Hagrid™s\\n eyes. ﬁNot a punishment, Hagrid, \\nmore a precaution. If someone else is caught\\n, you™ll be let out with a full apology Šﬂ        ﬁNot Azkaban?ﬂ croaked Hagrid. \\n\\n \\n      Before Fudge could answer, there was another loud rap on the door. \\n \\n      Dumbledore answered it. It\\n was Harry™s turn for an elbow in \\nthe ribs; he™d let out an audible gasp.  \\n      Mr. Lucius Malfoy strode into Hagrid™s \\nhut, swathed in a long black\\n traveling cloak, smiling a \\ncold and satisfied smile. Fang started to growl. \\n \\n      ﬁAlready here, Fudge,ﬂ he said approvingly. ﬁGood, good–ﬂ  \\n      ﬁWhat™re you doin™ here?ﬂ said\\n Hagrid furiously. ﬁGet outta my house!ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁMy dear man, please believe me, I have \\nno pleasure at all in being inside your Š er Š d™you call this a house?ﬂ said Lucius\\n Malfoy, sneering as he looked around the small cabin. ﬁI simply \\ncalled at the school and was told that the headmaster was here.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁAnd what exactly did you want with me, Lu\\ncius?ﬂ said Dumbledore. \\nHe spoke politely, but the fire was still blazing in his blue eyes.  \\n      ﬁDreadful thing, Dumbledore,ﬂ said Malfoy lazily, taking out a long roll of parchment, ﬁbut the \\ngovernors feel it™s time for you to step aside. Th\\nis is an Order of Suspension Š you™ll find all \\ntwelve signatures on it. I™m afraid we feel \\nyou™re losing your touch. How many attacks have \\nthere been now? Two more this afternoon, wasn™t\\n it? At this rate, there™ll be no Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts, and we all know what an awful loss that would be to the school.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁOh, now, see here, Lucius,ﬂ said Fudge, looking alarmed, ﬁDumbledore suspended Š no, no Š \\nlast thing we want just now.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁThe appointment Š or suspension Š of th\\ne headmaster is a matter for the governors, Fudge,ﬂ \\nsaid Mr. Malfoy smoothly. ﬁAnd as Dumbledor\\ne has failed to stop these attacks Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁSee here, Malfoy, if Dumbledore can™t st\\nop them,ﬂ said Fudge, whose upper lip was sweating \\nnow, ﬁI mean to say, who can?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁThat remains to be seen,ﬂ said Mr. Malfoy \\nwith a nasty smile. ﬁBut as\\n all twelve of us have voted Šﬂ  \\n      Hagrid leapt to his feet, his shaggy black head grazing the ceiling.  \\n      ‚An™ how many did yeh have ter threaten\\n an™ blackmail before they agreed, Malfoy, eh?ﬂ he \\nroared.        ﬁDear, dear, you know, that temper of \\nyours will lead you into trouble one of these days, \\nHagrid,ﬂ said Mr. Malfoy. ﬁI would advise you not to shout at the Azkaban guards like that. They won™t like it at all.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁYeh can™ take Dumbledore!ﬂ yelled Hagrid, making Fang the boarhound cower and whimper in \\nhis basket. ﬁTake him away, an™ the Muggle-born\\ns won™ stand a chance! There™ll be killin™ next!ﬂ  \\n      ﬁCalm yourself, Hagrid,ﬂ said Du\\nmbledore sharply. He looked at Lucius Malfoy. \\n \\n      ﬁIf the governors want my removal,\\n Lucius, I shall of course step aside Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁBut Šﬂ stuttered Fudge. \\n \\n      ﬁNo!ﬂ growled Hagrid. \\n \\n      Dumbledore had not taken his bright bl\\nue eyes off Lucius Malfoy™s cold gray ones.  \\n      ﬁHowever,ﬂ said Dumbledore, speaking very slowly and clearly so that none of them could miss \\na word, ﬁyou will find that I will only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to \\n\\nme– Help will always be given at \\nHogwarts to those who ask for it.ﬂ \\n \\n      For a second, Harry was almost sure Dumble\\ndore™s eyes flickered towa\\nrd the corner where he and Ron were hidden.  \\n      ﬁAdmirable sentiments,ﬂ said Malf\\noy, bowing. ﬁWe shall all miss your Š er Š highly \\nindividual way of running things, Albus, and \\nonly hope your successor will manage to prevent \\nany Š ah Š killins.ﬂ  \\n      He strode to the cabin door, opened it, and bowed Dumbledore out. Fudge, fiddling with his \\nbowler, waited for Hagrid to go ahead of him,\\n but Hagrid stood his ground, took a deep breath, and said carefully, ﬁIf anyone wanted ter find out some stuff, all they™d have ter do would be ter \\nfollow the spiders. That™d lead ‚em right. That™s all I™m sayin™.ﬂ \\n \\n      Fudge stared at him in amazement. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁAll right, I™m comin™, said Hagrid, pulling \\non his moleskin overcoat. But as he was about to \\nfollow Fudge through the door, he stopped again and said loudly, ﬁAn™ someone™ll need ter feed \\nFang while I™m away.ﬂ \\n \\n      The door banged shut and Ron pulled off the Invisibility Cloak.  \\n      ﬁWe™re in trouble now,ﬂ Ron said hoars\\nely. ﬁNo Dumbledore. They might as well close the \\nschool tonight. There™ll be an attack a day with him gone.ﬂ \\n \\n      Fang started howling, scratching at the closed door. CHAPTER FIFTEEN   Aragog  \\n  Summer was creeping over the grounds around the \\ncastle; sky and lake alike turned periwinkle blue and flowers large as cabbages burst into bloom in the greenhouses. But with no Hagrid \\nvisible from the castle windows, striding the grou\\nnds with Fang at his heels, the scene didn™t look right to Harry; no better, in fact, than the inside of the castle, where things were so horribly wrong.  \\n      Harry and Ron had tried to visit Hermione, \\nbut visitors were now barred from the hospital wing. \\n \\n      ﬁWe™re taking no more chances,ﬂ Madam Po\\nmfrey told them severely through a crack in the \\ninfirmary door. ﬁNo, I™m sorry, there™s every chance th\\ne attacker might come back to finish these \\npeople off–ﬂ  \\n      With Dumbledore gone, fear had spread as \\nnever before, so that the sun warming the castle walls \\noutside seemed to stop at the mullioned windows. \\nThere was barely a face to be seen in the \\nschool that didn™t look worried and tense, and any laughter that rang through the corridors \\nsounded shrill and unnatural and was quickly stifled.  \\n      Harry constantly repeated Dumbledore™s final words to himself \\nﬁI will only truly have left this \\nschool when none here are loyal to me– Help will\\n always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.ﬂ But what good were these words? Who exactly\\n were they supposed to ask for help, when everyone was just as confused and scared as they were?  \\n      Hagrid™s hint about the spiders was far easier to understand. The trouble was, there didn™t seem to be a single spider left in the \\ncastle to follow. Harry looked ev\\nerywhere he went, helped (rather \\nreluctantly) by Ron. They were hampered, of course, by the fact that they weren™t allowed to wander off on their own but had to move around th\\ne castle in a pack with the other Gryffindors. Most of their fellow students seemed glad that they were being shepherded from class to class by \\n\\nteachers, but Harry found it very irksome. \\n \\n      One person, however, seemed to be thoroughly\\n enjoying the atmosphere of terror and suspicion. \\nDraco Malfoy was strutting around the school as t\\nhough he had just been appointed Head Boy. \\nHarry didn™t realize what he was so pleased about until the Potions less\\non about two weeks after Dumbledore and Hagrid had le\\nft, when, sitting right behind Malfoy, Harry overheard him \\ngloating to Crabbe and Goyle.  \\n      ﬁI always thought Father might be the one \\nwho got rid of Dumbledore,ﬂ \\nhe said, not troubling to keep his voice down. ﬁI told you he thinks Dumb\\nledore™s the worst headma\\nster the school™s ever had. Maybe we™ll get a decent headmaster now\\n. Someone who won™t want the Chamber of \\nSecrets closed. McGonagall won™t last long, she™s only filling in–ﬂ  \\n      Snape swept past Harry, making no comme\\nnt about Hermione™s empty seat and cauldron. \\n      ﬁSir,ﬂ said Malfoy loudly. ﬁSir, why don™t \\nyou apply for the headmaster™s job?ﬂ \\n       ﬁNow, now, Malfoy,ﬂ said Snape, though he couldn™t suppress a thin-lipped smile. ﬁProfessor \\nDumbledore has only been suspended by the governor\\ns. I daresay he™ll be back with us soon enough.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁYeah, right,ﬂ said Malfoy, smirking. ﬁI expect you™d have Father\\n™s vote, sir, if you wanted to apply for the jobŠ I™ll tell Father you™re the best teacher here, sir Šﬂ \\n \\n      Snape smirked as he swept off around the dungeon, fortunately not spotting Seamus Finnigan, \\nwho was pretending to vomit into his cauldron. \\n \\n      ﬁI™m quite surprised the Mudbloods haven™\\nt all packed their bags by now,ﬂ Malfoy went on. ﬁBet you five Galleons the next one dies. Pity it wasn™t Granger Šﬂ  \\n      The bell rang at that moment, which was lucky; at Malfoy™s \\nlast words, Ron had leapt off his stool, and in the scramble to collect bags \\nand books, his attempts to reach Malfoy went \\nunnoticed.  \\n      ﬁLet me at him,ﬂ Ron growled as Harry \\nand Dean hung onto his arms. ﬁI don™t care, I don™t need \\nmy wand, I™m going to kill him with my bare hands Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁHurry up, I™ve got to take you all to Herbology,ﬂ barked Snape over the class™s heads, and off they marched, with Harry, Ron, and Dean bringing \\nup the rear, Ron still trying to get loose. It was only safe to let go of him when Snape had se\\nen them out of the castle and they were making \\ntheir way across the vegetable patch toward the greenhouses.  \\n      The Herbology class was very subdued; there were now two missing from their number, Justin \\nand Hermione. \\n \\n      Professor Sprout set them all to work pruni\\nng the Abyssinian Shrivelfigs. Harry went to tip an armful of withered stalks onto the compost \\nheap and found himself f\\nace-to-face with Ernie Macmillan. Ernie took a deep breath and said, very \\nformally, ﬁI just want to say, Harry, that I™m \\nsorry I ever suspected you. I know you™d never attack Hermione Granger, and I apologize for all \\nthe stuff I said. We™re all in the same boat now, and, well Šﬂ \\n \\n      He held out a pudgy hand, and Harry shook it. \\n \\n      Ernie and his friend Hannah came to work at the same Shrivelfig as Harry and Ron. \\n \\n      ﬁThat Draco Malfoy character,ﬂ said Ernie, breaking off dead twigs, ﬁhe seems very pleased \\nabout all this, doesn™t he? D™you know, I think \\nhe might be Slytherin™s heir.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁThat™s clever of you,ﬂ said Ron, who didn™t seem to have forgiven Ernie as readily as Harry. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁDo you think it™s Malfoy, Harry?ﬂ Ernie asked. \\n      ﬁNo,ﬂ said Harry, so firmly that Ernie and Hannah stared. \\n       A second later, Harry spotted something. \\n\\n \\n      Several large spiders were scuttling over the ground on the other side of the glass, moving in an unnaturally straight line as though taking the shortest route to a prearranged meeting. Harry hit \\nRon over the hand with his pruning shears.  \\n      ﬁOuch! What™re you Šﬂ  \\n      Harry pointed out the spiders, following their progress with his eyes screwed up against the sun.  \\n      ﬁOh, yeah,ﬂ said Ron, trying, and failing, \\nto look pleased. ﬁBut we can™t follow them now Šﬂ \\n \\n      Ernie and Hannah were listening curiously. \\n \\n      Harry™s eyes narrowed as he focused on the spiders. If they pursued\\n their fixed course, there could be no doubt about where they would end up.  \\n      ﬁLooks like they™re heading for the Forbidden Forest–ﬂ  \\n      And Ron looked even unhappier about that.  \\n      At the end of the lesson Professor Sprout escorted the class to their Defense Against the Dark \\nArts lesson. Harry and Ron lagged behind the others so they could talk out of earshot.        ﬁWe™ll have to use the Invisibility Cloak again,ﬂ Harry told Ron. ﬁWe can take Fang with us. \\nHe™s used to going into the forest with Hagrid, he might be some help.ﬂ \\n       ﬁRight,ﬂ said Ron, who was twirling his wand nervously in his fingers. ﬁEr Š aren™t there Š aren™t there supposed to be werewolves in the forest?ﬂ he added as they took their usual places at the back of Lockhart™s classroom. \\n \\n      Preferring not to answer that question, Harry said, ﬁThere are good things in there, too. The centaurs are all right, and the unicorns–ﬂ \\n \\n      Ron had never been into the Forbidden Forest before. Harry had entered it only once and had hoped never to do so again.  \\n      Lockhart bounded into the room and the class \\nstared at him. Every other teacher in the place was looking grimmer than usual, but Lockhart appeared nothing short of buoyant.  \\n      ﬁCome now,ﬂ he cried, beami\\nng around him. ﬁWhy all these long faces?ﬂ \\n \\n      People swapped exasperated looks, but nobody answered. \\n       ﬁDon™t you people realize,ﬂ said Lockhart, speaking slowly, as though they were all a bit dim, \\nﬁthe danger has passed! The culprit has been taken away Šﬂ        ﬁSays who?ﬂ said Dean Thomas loudly. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁMy dear young man, the Minister of Magic \\nwouldn™t have taken Hagrid if he hadn™t been one hundred percent sure that he was guilty,ﬂ said Lockhart, in the tone of someone explaining that \\none and one made two. \\n \\n      ﬁOh, yes he would,ﬂ said Ron, even more loudly than Dean. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁI flatter myself I know a \\ntouch more about Hagrid™s arrest than you do, Mr. Weasley,ﬂ said \\nLockhart in a self-satisfied tone.  \\n      Ron started to say that he didn™t think so, somehow, but stopped in midsentence when Harry \\nkicked him hard under the desk. \\n \\n      ﬁWe weren™t there, remember?ﬂ Harry muttered. \\n\\n \\n      But Lockhart™s disgusting cheeriness, his hints that he had always thought Hagrid was no good, his confidence that the whole bus\\niness was now at an end, irritated Harry so much that he \\nyearned to throw Gadding with Ghouls right in Lockhart™s stupid face. Instead he contented \\nhimself with scrawling a note to Ron: \\nLet™s do it tonight.  \\n      Ron read the message, swallowed hard, and \\nlooked sideways at the empty seat usually filled by Hermione. The sight seemed to stiffen his resolve, and he nodded. \\n \\n  The Gryffindor common room \\nwas always very crowded these days, because from six o™clock \\nonward the Gryffindors had nowhere else to go. They also had plenty to talk about, with the \\nresult that the common room often didn™t empty until past midnight. \\n \\n      Harry went to get the Invisibility Cloak out\\n of his trunk right after dinner, and spent the evening \\nsitting on it, waiting for the room to clear. Fred \\nand George challenged Harry and Ron to a few games of Exploding Snap, and Ginny sat watchi\\nng them, very subdued in Hermione™s usual \\nchair. Harry and Ron kept losing on purpose, trying to finish the games quickly, but even so, it \\nwas well past midnight when Fred, Ge\\norge, and Ginny finally went to bed.  \\n      Harry and Ron waited for the distant sounds of two dormitory doors closing before seizing the \\ncloak, throwing it over themselves, a\\nnd climbing through th\\ne portrait hole.  \\n      It was another difficult journey through the castle, dodging all the teachers. At last they reached the entrance hall, slid back the lock on the \\noak front doors, squeezed between them, trying to \\nstop any creaking, and stepped out into the moonlit grounds. \\n \\n      ﬁ™Course,ﬂ said Ron abruptly as they strode across the black grass, ﬁwe might get to the forest \\nand find there™s nothing to follow. Those spiders might not™ve been going \\nthere at all. I know it looked like they were moving in that sort of general direction, but–ﬂ \\n       His voice trailed away hopefully. \\n \\n      They reached Hagrid™s house, sad and sorry-looking with its blank windows. When Harry \\npushed the door open, Fang went mad with joy at\\n the sight of them. Worried he might wake \\neveryone at the castle with his deep, booming barks, they hastily fed him treacle fudge from a tin \\non the mantelpiece, which \\nglued his teeth together.  \\n      Harry left the Invisibility Cloak on Hagrid™s table. There would be no need for it in the pitch-dark forest.  \\n      ﬁC™mon, Fang, we™re going for a walk,ﬂ \\nsaid Harry, patting his leg, and Fang bounded happily out of the house behind them, dashed to the edge \\nof the forest, and lifted his leg against a large sycamore tree. \\n \\n      Harry took out his wand, murmured, \\nﬁLumos!ﬂ and a tiny light appeared at the end of it, just \\nenough to let them watch the pa\\nth for signs of spiders.  \\n      ﬁGood thinking,ﬂ said Ron. ﬁI™d light mine, too, but you know Š it™d probably blow up or \\nsomething–ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry tapped Ron on the shoulder, pointing \\nat the grass. Two solitary spiders were hurrying \\naway from the wandlight in\\nto the shade of the trees. \\n \\n      ﬁOkay,ﬂ Ron sighed as though resigned to the worst, ﬁI™m ready. Let™s go.ﬂ \\n \\n      So, with Fang scampering around them, sniffi\\nng tree roots and leaves, they entered the forest. By the glow of Harry™s wand, they followed the steady trickle of spiders moving along the path. \\nThey walked behind them for about twenty minut\\nes, not speaking, listening hard for noises other than breaking twigs and rustling leaves. Then, when the trees had become \\nthicker than ever, so \\nthat the stars overhead were no l\\nonger visible, and Harry™s wand s\\nhone alone in the sea of dark, they saw their spider guides leaving the path.  \\n      Harry paused, trying to see where the spiders were going, but everything outside his little sphere of light was pitch-black. He had never been this deep into the \\nforest before. He could vividly remember Hagrid advising him not to leave the fo\\nrest path last time he\\n™d been in here. But Hagrid was miles away now, probabl\\ny sitting in a cell in Azkaban, and he had also said to follow the spiders. \\n \\n      Something wet touched Harry™s hand and he\\n jumped backward, crushi\\nng Ron™s foot, but it was only Fang™s nose.  \\n      ﬁWhat d™you reckon?ﬂ Harry said to Ron, whos\\ne eyes he could just make\\n out, reflecting the light from his wand. \\n       ﬁWe™ve come this far,ﬂ said Ron. \\n \\n      So they followed the darting shadows of the spiders into the trees. \\nThey couldn™t move very quickly now; there were tree roots \\nand stumps in their way, barely \\nvisible in the near blackness. Harry could feel Fang™s hot breath on his hand. More than once, they had to stop, so that Harry could crouch down and find the spiders in the wandlight. \\n \\n      They walked for what seemed like at \\nleast half an hour, their robes snagging on low-slung branches and brambles. After a while, they \\nnoticed that the ground seemed to be sloping \\ndownward, though the trees were as thick as ever.  \\n      Then Fang suddenly let loose a great, echoing bark, making \\nboth Harry and Ron jump out of \\ntheir skins.  \\n      ﬁWhat?ﬂ said Ron loudly, looking around into\\n the pitch-dark, and gripping Harry™s elbow very hard.  \\n      ﬁThere™s something moving over ther\\ne,ﬂ Harry breathed. ﬁListen– sounds like something \\nbig–ﬂ  \\n      They listened. Some distance to their right, \\nthe something big was snapping branches as it carved \\na path through the trees. \\n \\n      ﬁOh, no,ﬂ said Ron. ﬁOh, no, oh, no, oh Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁShut up,ﬂ said Harry frantically. ﬁIt™ll hear you.ﬂ        ﬁHear me?ﬂ said Ron in an unnaturally high voice. ﬁIt™s already heard Fang!ﬂ  \\n      The darkness seemed to be pressing on thei\\nr eyeballs as they stood, terrified, waiting. There was a strange rumbling noise and then silence.  \\n      ﬁWhat d™you think it™s doing?ﬂ said Harry. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁProbably getting ready to pounce,ﬂ said Ron. \\n \\n      They waited, shivering, hardly daring to move. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁD™you think it™s gone?ﬂ Harry whispered. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁDunno Šﬂ \\n \\n      Then, to their right, came a sudden blaze of\\n light, so bright in the darkness that both of them \\nflung up their hands to shield their eyes. Fang yelped and tried to run, but got lodged in a tangle of thorns and yelped even louder.        ﬁHarry!ﬂ Ron shouted, his voice breaking with relief  ﬁHarry, it™s our car!ﬂ        ﬁWhat?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁCome on!ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      Harry blundered after Ron toward the light, stumbling and tripping, and a moment later they had \\nemerged into a clearing. \\n \\n      Mr. Weasley™s car was standing, empty, in the \\nmiddle of a circle of thic\\nk trees under a roof of dense branches, its headlights ablaze. As Ron walked, open-mouthe\\nd, toward it, it moved slowly toward him, exactly lik\\ne a large, turquoise dog greeting its owner. \\n \\n      ﬁIt™s been here all the time!ﬂ said R\\non delightedly, walking around the car. ﬁLook at it. The forest™s turned it wild–ﬂ \\n \\n      The sides of the car were scratched and smeared with mud. Apparently\\n it had taken to trundling around the forest on its own. Fang didn™t seem at \\nall keen on it; he kept close to Harry, who \\ncould feel him quivering. His breathing slowing down again, Harry stuffed his wand back into his robes.  \\n      ﬁAnd we thought it was going to attack us!ﬂ said Ron, leaning against the car and patting it. ﬁI wondered where it had gone!ﬂ  \\n      Harry squinted around on the floodlit ground fo\\nr signs of more spiders, but they had all scuttled \\naway from the glare of the headlights. \\n \\n      ﬁWe™ve lost the trail,ﬂ he\\n said. ﬁC™mon, let™s go and find them.ﬂ \\n \\n      Ron didn™t speak. He didn™t move. His eyes we\\nre fixed on a point some ten feet above the forest \\nfloor, right behind Harry. His face was livid with terror. \\n \\n      Harry didn™t even have time to turn around. \\nThere was a loud clicking noise and suddenly he felt \\nsomething long and hairy seize him around the middl\\ne and lift him off the ground, so that he was \\nhanging facedown. Struggling, terrified, he heard more clicking, and saw Ron™s legs leave the \\nground, too, heard Fang whimpering and howling Š \\nnext moment, he was being swept away \\ninto the dark trees. \\n \\n      Head hanging, Harry saw that what had hold of him was marching on six immensely long, hairy \\nlegs, the front two clutching him tightly below a pa\\nir of shining black pincers. Behind him, he \\ncould hear another of the creatures, no doubt carrying Ron. They were moving into the very heart of the forest. Harry could hear Fang fighting to free himself from a third monster, whining \\nloudly, but Harry couldn™t have yelled even if he had wanted to; he seemed to have left his voice \\nback with the car in the clearing.  \\n      He never knew how long he was in the creature™s clutches; he only knew that the darkness suddenly lifted enough for him to see that\\n the leaf-strewn ground was now swarming \\nwith spiders. Craning his neck sideways, he realized that they had reached the ridge of a vast \\nhollow, a hollow that had been cleared of trees, so that the stars shone brightly onto the worst scene he had ever laid eyes on.  \\n      Spiders. Not tiny spiders like those surging over the leaves below. Spiders the size of carthorses, eight-eyed, eight-legged, black, hairy, gigantic. The massive sp\\necimen that was carrying Harry \\nmade its way down the steep slope toward a misty, domed web in the very center of the hollow, \\n\\nwhile its fellows closed in all around it, clicking their pincers excitedly at the sight of its load.  \\n      Harry fell to the ground on all fours as the spider released him. R\\non and Fang thudded down next to him. Fang wasn™t howling anymore, but cowe\\nring silently on the spot. Ron looked exactly like Harry felt. His mouth was stretched wide in a \\nkind of silent scream and his eyes were popping. \\n \\n      Harry suddenly realized that the spider that had dropped him was saying something. It had been \\nhard to tell, because he clicked hi\\ns pincers with every word he spoke. \\n \\n      ﬁAragog!ﬂ it called. ﬁAragog!ﬂ \\n \\n      And from the middle of the misty, domed \\nweb, a spider the size of a small elephant emerged, \\nvery slowly. There was gray in the black of hi\\ns body and legs, and each of the eyes on his ugly, \\npincered head was milky white. He was blind. \\n \\n      ﬁWhat is it?ﬂ he sa\\nid, clicking his pincers rapidly.  \\n      ﬁMen,ﬂ clicked the spider who had caught Harry. \\n       ﬁIs it Hagrid?ﬂ said Aragog, moving \\ncloser, his eight milky eyes wandering vaguely. \\n \\n      ﬁStrangers,ﬂ clicked the spider who had brought Ron.  \\n      ﬁKill them,ﬂ clicked Aragog fretfully. ﬁI was sleeping–ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWe™re friends of Hagrid™s,ﬂ Harry shoute\\nd. His heart seemed to have left his chest to pound in \\nhis throat.  \\n      Click, click, click went the pincers of the spiders al\\nl around the hollow.  \\n      Aragog paused. \\n \\n      ﬁHagrid has never sent men into our hollow before,ﬂ he said slowly. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁHagrid™s in trouble,ﬂ said Harry, breathing very fast. ﬁThat™s why we™ve come.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁIn trouble?ﬂ said the aged spider, a\\nnd Harry thought he heard concern beneath the clicking pincers. ﬁBut why has he sent you?ﬂ \\n      Harry thought of getting to his feet but decided against it; he didn™t think his legs would support him. So he spoke from the ground, as calmly as he could. \\n       ﬁThey think, up at the school, that Hagrid™s been setting a Š a Š something on students. They™ve taken him to Azkaban.ﬂ \\n \\n      Aragog clicked his pincers furiously, and all around the hollow the sound was echoed by the crowd of spiders; it was like applause, except applause didn™t usually make Harry feel sick with \\nfear.  \\n      ﬁBut that was years ago,ﬂ said Aragog fret\\nfully. ﬁYears and years ago. I remember it well. That™s \\nwhy they made him leave the school. They believed that \\nI was the monster that dwells in what \\nthey call the Chamber of Secrets. They thought \\nthat Hagrid had opened the Chamber and set me \\nfree.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁAnd you– you didn™t come from the Chamber \\nof Secrets?ﬂ said Harry, who could feel cold sweat on his forehead.  \\n      ﬁI!ﬂ said Aragog, clicking angrily. ﬁI was not born in the castle. I come from a distant land. A \\ntraveler gave me to Hagrid when I was an \\negg. Hagrid was only a boy, but he cared for me, \\nhidden in a cupboard in the castle, feeding me on\\n scraps from the table. Hagrid is my good \\nfriend, and a good man. When I was discovered, and bl\\named for the death of a girl, he protected \\nme. I have lived here in the forest ever since, \\nwhere Hagrid still visits me. He even found me a \\nwife, Mosag, and you see how our family \\nhas grown, all through Hagrid™s goodness–ﬂ  \\n      Harry summoned what remained of his courage. \\n       ﬁSo you never Š never attacked anyone?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁNever,ﬂ croaked the old spider. ﬁIt would have been my instin\\nct, but out of respect for Hagrid, I never harmed a human. The body of the girl who \\nwas killed was discovered in a bathroom. I \\nnever saw any part of the castle but the cupboard in which I grew up. Our kind like the dark and the quiet–ﬂ  \\n      ﬁBut then– Do you know what did kill that girl?ﬂ said Harry. ﬁBecause whatever it is, it™s back \\nand attacking people again Šﬂ  \\n      His words were drowned by a loud outbreak of clicking and the rustling of many long legs \\nshifting angrily; large black sh\\napes shifted all around him. \\n \\n      ﬁThe thing that lives in the castle,ﬂ said Aragog, ﬁis an ancient creature we spiders fear above all others. Well do I remember how I pleaded with \\nHagrid to let me go, when I sensed the beast \\nmoving about the school.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁWhat is it?ﬂ said Harry urgently. \\n\\n       More loud clicking, more rustling; the spiders seemed to be closing in. \\n       ﬁWe do not speak of it!ﬂ said Aragog fiercel\\ny. ﬁWe do not name it! I never even told Hagrid the \\nname of that dread creature, though he asked me, many times.ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry didn™t want to press the subject, not with the spiders pressing closer on all sides. Aragog seemed to be tired of talking. He was backing sl\\nowly into his domed web, but his fellow spiders \\ncontinued to inch slowly toward Harry and Ron.  \\n      ﬁWe™ll just go, then,ﬂ Harry called desper\\nately to Aragog, hearing leaves rustling behind him. \\n \\n      ﬁGo?ﬂ said Aragog slowly. ﬁI think not–ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁBut Š but Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁMy sons and daughters do not harm Ha\\ngrid, on my command. But \\nI cannot deny them fresh \\nmeat, when it wanders so willingly into our midst. Good-bye, friend of Hagrid.ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry spun around. Feet away, towering above him, was a solid wall of spiders, clicking, their \\nmany eyes gleaming in their ugly black heads. \\n \\n      Even as he reached for his wand, Harry knew it was no good, there were too many of them, but \\nas he tried to stand, ready to die fighting, a loud, long note sounded, and a blaze of light flamed \\n\\nthrough the hollow.  \\n      Mr. Weasley™s car was thundering down \\nthe slope, headlights glaring, its horn screeching, knocking spiders aside; several were thrown onto their backs, their endless legs waving in the air. The car screeched to a halt in front of Harry and Ron and the doors flew open.  \\n      ﬁGet Fang!ﬂ Harry yelled, diving into the front seat; Ron seized the boarhound around the middle \\nand threw him, yelping, into the back of the car Š the doors slammed shut Š Ron didn™t touch \\nthe accelerator but the car didn™t need him; the engine roared and they were off, hitting more \\n\\nspiders. They sped up the slope, out of the hollow, and they were soon crashing through the forest, branches whipping the windows as the car wound its way cleverly through the widest gaps, following a path it obviously knew.  \\n      Harry looked sideways at Ron. His mouth \\nwas still open in the silent scream, but his eyes \\nweren™t popping anymore. \\n \\n      ﬁAre you okay?ﬂ \\n \\n      Ron stared straight ahead, unable to speak. \\n \\n      They smashed their way through the undergrowth, Fang howling loudly in the back seat, and Harry saw the side mirror snap off as they s\\nqueezed past a large oak. After ten noisy, rocky minutes, the trees thinned, and Harry coul\\nd again see patches of sky.      The car stopped so suddenly that they were nearly thrown into the windshield. They had reached \\nthe edge of the forest. Fang flung himself at th\\ne window in his anxiety to get out, and when Harry opened the door, he shot off through the trees to Hagrid™s house, tail between his legs. Harry got out too, and after a minute or so, Ron s\\neemed to regain the feeling in his limbs and \\nfollowed, still stiff-necked and staring. Harry gave the car a grateful pat as\\n it reversed back into \\nthe forest and disappeared from view. \\n \\n      Harry went back into Hagrid™s cabin to get the Invisibility Cloak. Fang was trembling under a blanket in his basket. When Harry got outside again, he found Ron being violent sick in the pumpkin patch. \\n \\n      ﬁFollow the spiders,ﬂ said Ron weakly, wiping his mouth on his sleeve. ﬁI™ll never forgive \\nHagrid. We™re lucky to be alive.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁI bet he thought Aragog wouldn™t hurt friends of his,ﬂ said Harry. \\n \\n      ﬁThat™s exactly Hagrid™s problem!ﬂ said \\nRon, thumping the wall of the cabin. ﬁHe always thinks \\nmonsters aren™t as bad as they™re made out, and look where it™s \\ngot him! A cell in Azkaban!ﬂ He \\nwas shivering uncontrollably now. ﬁWhat was the point of sending us in there? What have we \\nfound out, I™d like to know?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁThat Hagrid never opened the Chamber of\\n Secrets,ﬂ said Harry, th\\nrowing the cloak over Ron and prodding him in the arm to ma\\nke him walk. ﬁHe was innocent.ﬂ \\n \\n      Ron gave a loud snort. Evidently, hatching Aragog in a cupboard wa\\nsn™t his idea of being innocent.  \\n      As the castle loomed nearer Harry twitched \\nthe cloak to make sure th\\neir feet were hidden, then pushed the creaking front doors ajar. They walked carefully back across the entrance hall and up the marble staircase, holding their breath as they\\n passed corridors where watchful sentries were walking. At last they reached the safety of the Gryffindor common room, where the fire had \\nburned itself into glowing ash. They took off th\\ne cloak and climbed the winding stair to their dormitory. \\n \\n      Ron fell onto his bed without bothering to get undressed. Harry, however, didn™t feel very sleepy. He sat on the edge of his fourposter, thinking hard about everything Aragog had said.  \\n      The creature that was lurking somewhere in\\n the castle, he thought, sounded like a sort of monster \\nVoldemort Š even other monsters didn™t want to\\n name it. But he and Ron were no closer to \\nfinding out what it was, or how it petrified its victims. Even Hagrid had never known what was \\nin the Chamber of Secrets.  \\n      Harry swung his legs up onto his bed and leaned back against his pillows, watching the moon \\nglinting at him through the tower window.  \\n      He couldn™t see what else they could do. They had hit dead ends everywhere. Riddle had caught the wrong person, the Heir of Slytherin had got \\noff, and no one could tell whether it was the same person, or a different one, who had opened \\nthe Chamber this time. There was nobody else \\nto ask. Harry lay down, still thinking about what Aragog had said.  \\n      He was becoming drowsy when what seemed \\nlike their very last hope occurred to him, and he \\nsuddenly sat bolt upright.  \\n      ﬁRon,ﬂ he hissed through the dark, ﬁRon Šﬂ \\n \\n      Ron woke with a yelp like Fang™s, stared wildly around, and saw Harry.  \\n      ﬁRon Š that girl who died. Aragog said she was found in a bathroom,ﬂ said Harry, ignoring \\nNeville™s snuffling snores from the corner. ﬁWhat \\nif she never left the bathroom? What if she™s \\n\\nstill there?ﬂ \\n \\n      Ron rubbed his eyes, frowning through the moonlight. And then he understood, too.  \\n      ﬁYou don™t think Š not Moaning Myrtle?ﬂ  \\n              \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n CHAPTER SIXTEEN \\n  The Chamber of Secrets          ﬁAll those times we were in that bathroom, \\nand she was just three toilets away,ﬂ said Ron bitterly at breakfast next day, ﬁand we could™ve asked her, and now–ﬂ  \\n      It had been hard enough trying to look for spiders. Escaping their teachers long enough to sneak into a girls™ bathroom, the girls™ bathroom, moreove\\nr, right next to the scene of the first attack, \\nwas going to be almost impossible. \\n \\n      But something happened in their first lesson, Transfiguration, that drove the Chamber of Secrets out of their minds for the first \\ntime in weeks. Ten minutes into \\nthe class, Professor McGonagall told them that their exams would start on \\nthe first of June, one week from today.  \\n      ﬁExams?ﬂ howled Seamus Finnigan. ﬁWe™re still getting exams?ﬂ \\n \\n      There was a loud bang behind Harry as Neville Longbottom™s wand slipped, vanishing one of the \\nlegs on his desk. Professor McGonagall restored it with a wave of her own wand, and turned, frowning, to Seamus. \\n \\n      ﬁThe whole point of keeping the school open at this time is for you to receive your education,ﬂ \\nshe said sternly. ﬁThe exams will therefore take\\n place as usual, and I trust you are all studying \\nhard.ﬂ        Studying hard! It had never occurred to Harry that there would be exam\\ns with the castle in this state. There was a great deal of mutinous \\nmuttering around the room, which made Professor \\nMcGonagall scowl even more darkly.        ﬁProfessor Dumbledore™s instructions were \\nto keep the school running as normally as possible, \\nshe said. ﬁAnd that, I need hardly point out, m\\neans finding out how much you have learned this \\nyear.ﬂ  \\n      Harry looked down at the pair of white rabbits he was supposed to be turning into slippers. What \\nhad he learned so far this year? He couldn™t seem \\nto think of anything that would be useful in an exam. \\n \\n      Ron looked as though he™d just been told he had to go and live in the Forbidden Forest. \\n \\n      ﬁCan you imagine me taking exams with \\nthis?ﬂ he asked Harry, holding up his wand, which had \\njust started whistling loudly.    \\n      Three days before their first exam, Professor McGonagall made another announcement at \\nbreakfast.        ﬁI have good news,ﬂ she said, and th\\ne Great Hall, instead of falling silent, erupted. \\n \\n      ﬁDumbledore™s coming back\\n!ﬂ several people yelled joyfully.  \\n      ﬁYou™ve caught the Heir of Slytherin!ﬂ squealed a girl at the Ravenclaw table. \\n \\n      ﬁQuidditch matches are back on!ﬂ roared Wood excitedly. \\n\\n \\n      When the hubbub had subsided, Professor McG\\nonagall said, ﬁProfessor Sprout has informed me \\nthat the Mandrakes are ready for cutting at last. \\nTonight, we will be able to revive those people \\nwho have been Petrified. I need hardly remind you \\nall that one of them ma\\ny well be able to tell us who, or what, attacked them. I am hopeful that\\n this dreadful year will end with our catching the culprit.ﬂ \\n \\n      There was an explosion of cheering. Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and wasn™t at all surprised to see that Draco Malfoy hadn™t joined in. Ron, however, was looking happier than \\nhe™d looked in days.  \\n      ﬁIt won™t matter that we never asked Myrt\\nle, then!ﬂ he said to Harry. ﬁHermione™ll probably \\nhave all the answers when they wake her up! Mind you, she™ll go crazy when she finds out we™ve got exams in three days™ time. She hasn™t studied. \\nIt might be kinder to leave her where she is till \\nthey™re over.ﬂ \\n \\n      Just then, Ginny Weasley came over and sa\\nt down next to Ron. She looked tense and nervous, and Harry noticed that her hands were twisting in her lap.        ﬁWhat™s up?ﬂ said Ron, \\nhelping himself to more porridge. \\n       Ginny didn™t say anything, but glanced up and down the Gryffindor table with a scared look on her face that reminded Harry of so\\nmeone, though he couldn™t think who. \\n \\n      ﬁSpit it out,ﬂ said Ron, watching her. \\n \\n      Harry suddenly realized who Ginny looked like. She was rocking backward and forward slightly in her chair, exactly like Dobby did when he was teetering on the edge of revealing forbidden \\ninformation. \\n \\n      ﬁI™ve got to tell you something,ﬂ \\nGinny mumbled, carefully \\nnot looking at Harry.  \\n      ﬁWhat is it?ﬂ said Harry. \\n\\n \\n      Ginny looked as though she couldn™t find the right words.  \\n      ﬁWhat?ﬂ said Ron.  \\n      Ginny opened her mouth, but no sound came out\\n. Harry leaned forward and spoke quietly, so that only Ginny and Ron could hear him. \\n       ﬁIs it something about the Chamber of \\nSecrets? Have you seen something? Someone acting \\noddly?ﬂ \\n \\n      Ginny drew a deep breath and, at that precise moment, Percy Weasle\\ny appeared, looking tired and wan.  \\n      ﬁIf you™ve finished eating, I™ll take that seat, Ginny. I™m starving, I™ve onl\\ny just come off patrol \\nduty.ﬂ  \\n      Ginny jumped up as though her chair had just been electrified, gave Percy a fleeting, frightened look, and scampered away. Percy sat down and gr\\nabbed a mug from the center of the table. \\n \\n      ﬁPercy!ﬂ said Ron angrily. ﬁShe was just about to tell us something important!ﬂ \\n \\n      Halfway through a gulp of tea, Percy choked. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁWhat sort of thing?ﬂ he said, coughing. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁI just asked her if she™d seen anything odd, and she started to say–ﬂ  \\n      ﬁOh Š that Š that™s nothing to do with the Chamber of Secrets,\\nﬂ said Percy at once.  \\n      ﬁHow do you know?ﬂ sa\\nid Ron, his eyebrows raised. \\n       ﬁWell, er, if you must know, Ginny, er, walked\\n in on me the other day when I was Š well, never \\nmind Š the point is, she spotted me doing something \\nand I, um, I asked her not to mention it to \\nanybody. I must say, I did think she™d keep her word. It™s nothing, really, I™d just rather Šﬂ        Harry had never seen Percy look so uncomfortable.  \\n      ﬁWhat were you doing, Percy?ﬂ said \\nRon, grinning. ﬁGo on, tell us, we won™t laugh.ﬂ  \\n      Percy didn™t smile back. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁPass me those rolls, Harry, I™m starving.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n  Harry knew the whole mystery might be solved tomorrow without their help, but he wasn™t about \\nto pass up a chance to speak to Myrtle if it turned up Š and to his delight it did, midmorning, \\nwhen they were being led to History of Magic by Gilderoy Lockhart. \\n \\n      Lockhart, who had so often assured them that all danger had passed, only to be proved wrong \\nright away, was now wholeheartedly convinced that it was hardly worth the trouble to see them \\nsafely down the corridors. His hair wasn™t as sleek as us\\nual; it seemed he had been up most of the \\nnight, patrolling the fourth floor.       ﬁMark my words,ﬂ he said, ushering them around a corner. ﬁThe first words out of those poor \\nPetrified people™s mouths will be ‚\\nIt was Hagrid.™ Frankly, I™m astounded Professor McGonagall thinks all these security \\nmeasures are necessary.ﬂ \\n       ﬁI agree, sir,ﬂ said Harry, making Ron drop his books in surprise. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁThank you, Harry,ﬂ said Lockhart graciously while they waited for a long line of Hufflepuffs to pass. ﬁI mean, we teachers have quite enough to \\nbe getting on with, without walking students to \\nclasses and standing guard all night–ﬂ  \\n      ﬁThat™s right,ﬂ said Ron, catching on. ﬁWhy \\ndon™t you leave us here, sir, we™ve only got one more corridor to go Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁYou know, Weasley, I think I will,ﬂ said Lo\\nckhart. ﬁI really should go and prepare my next \\nclass Šﬂ  \\n      And he hurried off. \\n \\n      ﬁPrepare his class,ﬂ Ron sneered after him. ﬁGone to curl his hair, more like.ﬂ \\n \\n      They let the rest of the Gryffindors draw ahead of them, then darted\\n down a side passage and hurried off toward Moaning Myrtle™s bathroom. Bu\\nt just as they were congratulating each other \\non their brilliant scheme. \\n \\n      ﬁPotter! Weasley! What are you doing?ﬂ \\n       It was Professor McGonagall, and her mouth was the thinnest of thin lines. \\n       ﬁWe were Š we were Šﬂ Ron stammered. ﬁWe were going to Š to go and see Šﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁHermione,ﬂ said Harry. Ron and \\nProfessor McGonagall both looked at him. \\n \\n      ﬁWe haven™t seen her for ages, Professor,\\nﬂ Harry went on hurriedly, treading on Ron™s foot, ﬁand \\nwe thought we™d sneak into the hospital wing, you know, and tell her the Mandrakes are nearly ready and, er, not to worry Šﬂ  \\n      Professor McGonagall was still staring at him, and for a moment, Ha\\nrry thought she was going to explode, but when she spoke, it was in a strangely croaky voice.  \\n      ﬁOf course,ﬂ she said, and Harry, amazed, sa\\nw a tear glistening in her beady eye. ﬁOf course, I realize this has all been hardest on the friends of those who have been– I quite understand. Yes, Potter, of course you may visit Miss Granger. \\nI will inform Professor Binns where you™ve gone. \\n\\nTell Madam Pomfrey I have given my permission.ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry and Ron walked away, hardly daring to believe that they™d av\\noided detention. As they turned the corner, they distinctly hear\\nd Professor McGonagall blow her nose.       ﬁThat,ﬂ said Ron fervently, ﬁwas the best story you™ve ever come up with.ﬂ \\n       They had no choice now but to go to the hospital wing and tell Madam Pomfrey that they had Professor McGonagall™s permission to visit Hermione.  \\n      Madam Pomfrey let them in, but reluctantly. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁThere™s just no point talking to a Petrified. person,ﬂ she said, and they had to admit she had a \\npoint when they™d taken their seats next to Hermione. It was plain that Hermione didn™t have the \\nfaintest inkling that she had visitors, and that they might just as well tell her bedside cabinet not \\nto worry for all the good it would do.  \\n      ﬁWonder if she did see the attacker, though?ﬂ\\n said Ron, looking sadly at Hermione™s rigid face. \\nﬁBecause if he sneaked up on them all, no one™ll ever know–ﬂ \\n \\n      But Harry wasn™t looking at Hermione™s f\\nace. He was more interested in her right hand. It lay \\nclenched on top of her blankets, and bending clos\\ner, he saw that a piece of paper was scrunched \\ninside her fist.  \\n      Making sure that Madam Pomfrey wa\\ns nowhere near, he pointed this out to Ron.  \\n      ﬁGo on and get it out,ﬂ Ron whispered, shifting his chair so that he blocked Harry from Madam \\nPomfrey™s view. \\n \\n      It was no easy task. Hermione™s hand wa\\ns clamped so tightly around the paper that Harry was \\nsure he was going to tear it. While Ron kept \\nwatch he tugged and twisted, and at last, after several tense minutes, the paper came free. \\n \\n      It was a page torn from a very old libra\\nry book. Harry smoothed it out eagerly and Ron leaned close to read it, too.    ﬁOf the many fearsome beasts and monsters that \\nroam our land, there is none more curious or more deadly than the Basilisk, known also as the \\nKing of Serpents. This snake, which may reach gigantic size and live many hundreds of years, is \\nborn from a chicken™s egg, hatched beneath a \\ntoad. Its methods of killing are most wondrous, for aside from its deadly and venomous fangs, the Basilisk has a murderous stare, and all who are fixed with the beam \\nof its eye shall suffer instant death. Spiders flee before the Basilisk, for it is their mortal enemy, and the Basilisk flees \\nonly from the crowing of the rooster, which is fatal to it.ﬂ \\n \\n    And beneath this, a single word had been wr\\nitten, in a hand Harry recognized as Hermione™s. \\nPipes.   \\n      It was as though somebody had just flicked a light on in his brain.  \\n      ﬁRon,ﬂ he breathed. ﬁThis is it. This is the answer. The monster in the Chamber™s a \\nbasilisk Š a giant serpent! \\nThat™s why I™ve been hearing that voice all over the place, and nobody else has \\nheard it. It™s because I understand Parseltongue–ﬂ \\n       Harry looked up at the beds around him. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁThe basilisk kills people by looking at \\nthem. But no one™s died Š because no one looked it \\nstraight in the eye. Colin saw it through his camer\\na. The basilisk burned up all the film inside it, but Colin just got Petrified. Justin– Justin mu\\nst™ve seen the basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick! Nick got the full blast of it, but he couldn™t die again– and Hermione and that Ravenclaw \\nprefect were found with a mirror next to them. \\nHermione had just realized the monster was a \\nbasilisk. I bet you anything she warned the first person she met to look around corners with a \\nmirror first! And that girl \\npulled out her mirror Š and Šﬂ \\n \\n      Rods jaw had dropped. \\n \\n      ﬁAnd Mrs. Norris?ﬂ he whispered eagerly. \\n\\n \\n      Harry thought hard, picturing the scene on the night of Halloween.  \\n      ﬁThe water–ﬂ he said slowly. ﬁThe fl\\nood from Moaning Myrtle™s bathroom. I bet you Mrs. \\nNorris only saw the reflection–ﬂ  \\n      He scanned the page in his hand eagerly. The more he looked at it, the more it made sense. \\n \\n      ﬁ– The crowing of the rooster– is fatal to itﬂ! \\nhe read aloud. ﬁHagrid™s roosters were killed! The Heir of Slytherin didn™t want one anywhere near the castle once the Chamber was opened! \\nSpiders flee before it.! It all fits!ﬂ  \\n      ﬁBut how™s the basilisk been getting around the place?ﬂ said Ron. ﬁA giant snake– Someone \\nwould™ve seen–ﬂ  \\n      Harry, however, pointed at the word Hermione had scribbled at the foot of the page. \\n \\n      ﬁPipes,ﬂ he said. ﬁPipes– Ron, it™s been \\nusing the plumbing. I™ve been \\nhearing that voice inside the walls–ﬂ \\n \\n      Ron suddenly grabbed Harry™s arm. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁThe entrance to the Chamber of Secrets!ﬂ he said hoarsely. ﬁWhat if it™s a bathroom? What if \\nit™s in Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁMoaning Myrtle™s bathroom,ﬂ said Harry.  \\n      They sat there, excitement cour\\nsing through them, hardly able to believe it. \\n \\n      ﬁThis means,ﬂ said Harry, ﬁI can™t be the only Parselmouth in the school. The Heir of Slytherin™s \\none, too. That™s how he™s been controlling the basilisk.ﬂ \\n      ﬁWhat™re we going to do?ﬂ said Ron, whos\\ne eyes were flashing. ﬁShould we go straight to McGonagall?ﬂ \\n       ﬁLet™s go to the staff room,ﬂ said Harry, \\njumping up. ﬁShe™ll be there in ten minutes. It™s nearly \\nbreak.ﬂ  \\n      They ran downstairs. Not wanting to be discovered hanging around in another corridor, they went straight into the deserted staff room. It was a large, pa\\nneled room full of dark, wooden \\nchairs. Harry and Ron paced around it, too excited to sit down. \\n \\n      But the bell to signal break never came. \\n \\n      Instead, echoing through the corridors came Professor McGonagall™s voice, magically \\nmagnified. \\n \\n      ﬁAll students to return to their House dormito\\nries at once. All teachers return to the staff room. \\nImmediately, please.ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry wheeled around to stare at Ron. ﬁNot another attack? Not now?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWhat™ll we do?ﬂ said Ron, \\naghast. ﬁGo back to the dormitory?ﬂ   ﬁNo,ﬂ said Harry, glancing around. There was an ugly sort of wardrobe to his left, full of the teachers™ cloaks. ﬁIn here. Let™s he\\nar what it™s all about. Then we can tell them what we™ve found \\nout.ﬂ        They hid themselves inside it, listening \\nto the rumbling of hundreds of people moving overhead, \\nand the staff room door banging open. From between \\nthe musty folds of the cloaks, they watched \\nthe teachers filtering into the r\\noom. Some of them were looking puzzled, others downright \\nscared. Then Professor McGonagall arrived.        ﬁIt has happened,ﬂ she told the silent staff room. ﬁA student has been \\ntaken by the monster. Right \\ninto the Chamber itself.ﬂ \\n \\n      Professor Flitwick let out a squeal. Professor Sprout clapped her hands over her mouth. Snape \\ngripped the back of a chair very hard and said, ﬁHow can you be sure?ﬂ  \\n      ﬁThe Heir of Slytherin,ﬂ said Professor \\nMcGonagall, who was very white, ﬁleft another message. \\nRight underneath the first one. ‚Her skeleton will lie in the Chamber forever.™\\n ﬂ  \\n      Professor Flitwick burst into tears. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁWho is it?ﬂ said Madam Hooch, who ha\\nd sunk, weak-kneed, into a chair. ﬁWhich student?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁGinny Weasley,ﬂ said Professor McGonagall.        Harry felt Ron slide silently \\ndown onto the wardrobe floor beside him. \\n       ﬁWe shall have to send all the students \\nhome tomorrow,ﬂ said Professor McGonagall. ﬁThis is \\nthe end of Hogwarts. Dumbledore always said–ﬂ  \\n      The staffroom door banged open again. For \\none wild moment, Harry was sure it would be \\nDumbledore. But it was Lockhart, and he was beaming. \\n \\n      ﬁSo sorry Š dozed off Š what have I missed?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      He didn™t seem to notice \\nthat the other teachers were looking \\nat him with something remarkably \\nlike hatred. Snape stepped forward. \\n \\n      ﬁJust the man,ﬂ he said. ﬁThe very man. \\nA girl has been snatched by the monster, Lockhart. \\nTaken into the Chamber of Secrets itsel\\nf. Your moment has come at last.ﬂ \\n \\n      Lockhart blanched. \\n \\n      ﬁThat™s right, Gilderoy,ﬂ chipped in Professor Sprout. ﬁWeren\\n™t you saying just last night that you™ve known all along where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁI Š well, I Šﬂsputtered Lockhart. \\n \\n      ﬁYes, didn™t you tell me you were sure \\nyou knew what was inside it?ﬂ piped up Professor \\nFlitwick.        ﬁD-did I? I don™t recall Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁI certainly remember you saying you were \\nsorry you hadn™t had a crack at the monster before \\nHagrid was arrested,ﬂ said Snape. ﬁDidn™t you say that the whole affair had been bungled, and that you should have been given a free rein from the first?ﬂ \\n \\n      Lockhart stared around at his stony-faced colleagues. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁI Š I really never Š you may have misunderstood Šﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁWe™ll leave it to you, th\\nen, Gilderoy,ﬂ said Professor McGonagall. ﬁTonight will be an excellent time to do it. We™ll make sure ev\\neryone™s out of your way. You™ll be able to tackle the monster \\nall by yourself. A free rein at last.ﬂ  \\n      Lockhart gazed desperately around him, \\nbut nobody came to the rescue. He didn™t look remotely \\nhandsome anymore. His lip was trembling, and in\\n the absence of his usually toothy grin, he looked weak-chinned and feeble.  \\n      ﬁV-very well,ﬂ he said. ﬁI™ll Š I™ll be in my office, getting Š getting ready.ﬂ \\n       And he left the room. \\n \\n      ﬁRight,ﬂ said Professor McGonagall, whose nostrils were flared, ﬁthat™s got him out from under \\nour feet. The Heads of Houses should go and inform\\n their students what has happened. Tell them \\nthe Hogwarts Express will take them home firs\\nt thing tomorrow. Will the rest of you please \\nmake sure no students have been \\nleft outside their dormitories.ﬂ \\n \\n      The teachers rose and left, one by one. \\n   \\n  It was probably the worst day of\\n Harry™s entire life. He, Ron, Fred, and George sat together in a corner of the Gryffindor common room, unable to sa\\ny anything to each other. Percy wasn™t there. \\nHe had gone to send an owl to Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, then shut himself up in his dormitory. \\n \\n      No afternoon ever lasted as long as that one, nor had Gryffindor Tower ever been so crowded, yet so quiet. Near sunset, Fred and George went up to bed, unable to sit there any longer. \\n \\n      ﬁShe knew something, Harry,ﬂ said Ron, spea\\nking for the first time since they had entered the \\nwardrobe in the staff room. ﬁThat™s why she was taken. It wasn™t some stupid thing about Percy \\nat all. She™d found out something about the Chambe\\nr of Secrets. That must be why she was Šﬂ \\nRon rubbed his eyes frantically. ﬁI mean, she was a pure-blood. There can™t be any other reason.ﬂ  \\n      Harry could see the sun sinking, blood-red, below the skyline. This was the worst he had ever felt. If only there was something they could do. Anything. \\n \\n      ﬁHarryﬂ said Ron. ﬁD™you think there™s any chance at all she™s not Š you know Šﬂ        Harry didn™t know what to say. He couldn™t see how Ginny c\\nould still be alive.        ﬁD™you know what?ﬂ said Ron. ﬁI think we should go and see Lockhart. Tell him what we know. \\nHe™s going to try and get into the Chamber. We ca\\nn tell him where we think it is, and tell him it™s \\na basilisk in there.ﬂ \\n \\n      Because Harry couldn™t think of anythi\\nng else to do, and because he wanted to be doing something, he agreed. The Gryffindors around them \\nwere so miserable, and felt so sorry for the \\nWeasleys, that nobody tried to stop them as they\\n got up, crossed the room, and left through the \\nportrait hole. \\n \\n      Darkness was falling as they walked down to Lockhart™s office. There seemed to be a lot of \\nactivity going on inside it. They could hear scraping, thumps, and hurried footsteps. \\n \\n      Harry knocked and there was a sudden silence from inside. Then the door opened the tiniest \\ncrack and they saw one of Lockhart™s eyes peering through it.  \\n      ﬁOh Š Mr. Potter Š Mr. Weasley Šﬂ he said, opening the door a bit wider. ﬁI™m rather busy at \\nthe moment Šif you would be quick Šﬂ \\n       ﬁProfessor, we™ve got some informati\\non for you,ﬂ said Harry. ﬁWe think it™ll help you.ﬂ \\n       ﬁEr Š well Š it™s not terribly Šﬂ The side \\nof Lockhart™s face that they could see looked very \\nuncomfortable. ﬁI mean Š well Š all right Šﬂ \\n \\n      He opened the door and they entered. \\n \\n      His office had been almost completely st\\nripped. Two large trunks stood open on the floor. Robes, jade-green, lilac, midnight blue, \\nhad been hastily folded into one of them; books were jumbled \\nuntidily into the other. The phot\\nographs that had covered the walls were now crammed into \\nboxes on the desk.  \\n      ﬁAre you going somewhere?ﬂ said Harry. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁEr, well, yes,ﬂ said Lockhart, ripping a life-size poster of himself from the back of the door as \\nhe spoke and starting to roll it up. ﬁUrg\\nent call Š unavoidable Š got to go Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁWhat about my sister?ﬂ said Ron jerkily. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁWell, as to that Š most unfortunate Šﬂ \\nsaid Lockhart, avoiding their eyes as he wrenched open \\na drawer and started emptying \\nthe contents into a bag. ﬁNo one regrets more than I Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁYou™re the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher!ﬂ said \\nHarry. ﬁYou can™t go now! Not with all the Dark stuff going on here!ﬂ  \\n      ﬁWell Š I must say Š when I took the j\\nob Šﬂ Lockhart muttered, now piling socks on top of \\nhis robes. ﬁnothing in the job description Š didn™t expect Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁYou mean you™re running away?ﬂ said Harry disbelievingly. ﬁAfter all that stuff you did in your books Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁBooks can be misleading,ﬂ said Lockhart delicately. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁYou wrote them!ﬂ Harry shouted. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁMy dear boy,ﬂ said Lockhart, straightening up and frowning at Harry. ﬁDo use your common \\nsense. My books wouldn™t have sold half as well if people didn™t think \\nI™d done all those things. No one wants to read about some ugly old Armenian\\n warlock, even if he did save a village from \\nwerewolves. He™d look dreadful on the front cover. No dress sense at all. And the witch who \\nbanished the Bandon Banshee had a harelip. I mean, come on Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁSo you™ve just been taking credit for wh\\nat a load of other people have done?ﬂ said Harry incredulously.  \\n      ﬁHarry, Harry,ﬂ said Lockhart, shaking his head impatiently, ﬁit™s not nearly as simple as that. \\nThere was work involved. I had to track these people down. Ask them exactly how they managed \\nto do what they did. Then I had to put a Memory Charm on them so they wouldn™t remember \\ndoing it. If there™s one thing I pride myself on, it™s my Memory Charms. No, it™s been a lot of \\nwork, Harry. It™s not all book signings and publicity photos, you know. You want fame, you \\nhave to be prepared for a long hard slog.ﬂ  \\n      He banged the lids of his trunks shut and locked them. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁLet™s see,ﬂ he said. ﬁI think that™s everything. Yes. Only one thing left.ﬂ  \\n      He pulled out his wand and turned to them. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁAwfully sorry, boys, but I™ll have to put a Memory Charm on you now. Can™t have you \\nblabbing my secrets all over the place. I™d never sell another book Šﬂ \\n \\n      Harry reached his wand just in time. Loc\\nkhart had barely raised his, when Harry bellowed, \\nﬁExpelliarmus!\\nﬂ  \\n      Lockhart was blasted backward, falling over his trunk; his wand flew high into the air; Ron caught it, and flung it out of the open window.  \\n      ﬁShouldn™t have let Professor Snape teach us that one,ﬂ said Harry furiously, kicking Lockhart™s trunk aside. Lockhart was looking up at him, f\\neeble once more. Harry was still pointing his wand \\nat him. \\n \\n      ﬁWhat d™you want me to do?ﬂ said Loc\\nkhart weakly. ﬁI don™t know where the Chamber of Secrets is. There™s nothing I can do.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁYou™re in luck,ﬂ said Harry, forcing Lockhart to his feet at wandpoint. ﬁWe think \\nwe know where it is. And what™s inside it. Let™s go.ﬂ  \\n      They marched Lockhart out of his offi\\nce and down the nearest stairs, along the dark corridor where the messages shone on the wall, to \\nthe door of Moaning Myrtle™s bathroom. \\n \\n      They sent Lockhart in first. Harry was pleased to see that he was shaking.  \\n      Moaning Myrtle was sitting on the tank of the end toilet. \\n \\n      ﬁOh, it™s you,ﬂ she said when she saw Harry. ﬁWhat do you want this time?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁTo ask you how you died,ﬂ said Harry. \\n \\n      Myrtle™s whole aspect changed at once. She looked as though she had never been asked such a flattering question.  \\n      ﬁOoooh, it was dreadful,ﬂ she said with relish. ﬁIt happened right in here. I died in this very stall. I remember it so well. I™d hidden because Olive \\nHornby was teasing me about my glasses. The \\ndoor was locked, and I was crying, and then I heard somebody come in. They said something \\nfunny. A different language, I think it must have \\nbeen. Anyway, what really got me was that it \\nwas a boy speaking. So I unlocked the door, to tell him \\nto go and use his own toilet, and then Šﬂ Myrtle swelled importantly, her face shining. ﬁI \\ndied.ﬂ        ﬁHow?ﬂ said Harry. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁNo idea,ﬂ said Myrtle in hushed tones. ﬁI just remember seeing a pair \\nof great, big, yellow eyes. My whole body sort of seized up, and then I was floating away–ﬂ She looked dreamily at Harry. \\n\\nﬁAnd then I came back again. I was determined\\n to haunt Olive Hornby, you see. Oh, she was sorry she™d ever laughed at my glasses.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWhere exactly did \\nyou see the eyes?ﬂ said Harry. \\n \\n      ﬁSomewhere there,ﬂ said Myrtle, pointi\\nng vaguely toward the sink in front of her toilet.  \\n      Harry and Ron hurried over to it. Lockhart was standing well back, a look of utter terror on his \\nface.  \\n      It looked like an ordinary sink. They exam\\nined every inch of it, inside and out, including the pipes below. And then Harry saw it: Scratched on the side of one of the copper taps was a tiny \\nsnake.  \\n      ﬁThat tap™s never worked,ﬂ said \\nMyrtle brightly as he tried to turn it. \\n \\n      ﬁHarry,ﬂ said Ron. ﬁSay something. Something in Parseltongue.ﬂ \\n       ﬁBut Šﬂ Harry thought hard. The only times\\n he™d ever managed to speak Parseltongue were \\nwhen he™d been faced with a real snake. He stared hard at the tiny engraving, trying to imagine it \\nwas real.  \\n      ﬁOpen up,ﬂ he said. \\n \\n      He looked at Ron, who shook his head. \\n \\n      ﬁEnglish,ﬂ he said. \\n \\n      Harry looked back at the snake, willing himsel\\nf to believe it was alive. If he moved his head, the \\ncandlelight made it look \\nas though it were moving. \\n \\n      ﬁOpen up,ﬂ he said. \\n \\n      Except that the words weren™t what he hear\\nd; a strange hissing had escaped him, and at once the \\ntap glowed with a brilliant white light and began to spin. Next second, the sink began to move; \\nthe sink, in fact, sank, right out of sight, leaving a large pipe exposed, a pipe wide enough for a man to slide into. \\n      Harry heard Ron gasp and looked up again. He had made up his mind what he was going to do. \\n \\n      ﬁI™m going down there,ﬂ he said. \\n\\n \\n      He couldn™t not go, not now they had found the entrance to the Chamber, not if there was even the faintest, slimmest, wildest ch\\nance that Ginny might be alive. \\n \\n      ﬁMe too,ﬂ said Ron. \\n \\n      There was a pause. \\n \\n      ﬁWell, you hardly seem to need me,ﬂ said \\nLockhart, with a shadow of his old smile. ﬁI™ll just Šﬂ \\n \\n      He put his hand on the door knob, but Ron and Harry both pointed \\ntheir wands at him. \\n \\n      ﬁYou can go first,ﬂ Ron snarled. \\n \\n      White-faced and wandless, Lockhart approached the opening. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁBoys,ﬂ he said, his voice \\nfeeble. ﬁBoys, what good will it do?ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry jabbed him in the back with hi\\ns wand. Lockhart slid his legs into the pipe.  \\n      ﬁI really don™t think Šﬂ he started to say, but Ron gave him a push, and he slid out of sight. Harry followed quickly. He lowered himsel\\nf slowly into the pipe, then let go.        It was like rushing down an endless, slimy, dark slide. He could see more pipes branching off in \\nall directions, but none as large as theirs, which twisted and turned, sloping steeply downward, and he knew that he was falling deeper below the school than even the dungeons. Behind him he \\ncould hear Ron, thudding slightly at the curves.        And then, just as he had begun to worry about what would happen when he hit the ground, the pipe leveled out, and he shot out of the end with a wet thud, landing on the damp floor of a dark \\nstone tunnel large enough to stand in. Lockhart was getting to his \\nfeet a little ways away, covered \\nin slime and white as a ghost. Harry stood as\\nide as Ron came whizzing out of the pipe, too. \\n \\n      ﬁWe must be miles under the school,ﬂ\\n said Harry, his voice echoing in the black tunnel.  \\n      ﬁUnder the lake, probably,ﬂ said Ron, squinting around at the dark, slimy walls.  \\n      All three of them turned\\n to stare into the darkness ahead. \\n \\n      ﬁLumos!ﬂ Harry muttered to his wand and it lit again. ﬁC™mon,ﬂ he said to Ron and Lockhart, \\nand off they went, their footsteps slapping loudly on the wet floor.  \\n      The tunnel was so dark that they could only see a little distance ahead. Their shadows on the wet \\nwalls looked monstrous in the wandlight. \\n       ﬁRemember,ﬂ Harry said quietly as they\\n walked cautiously forward, ﬁany sign of movement, \\nclose your eyes right away–ﬂ  \\n      But the tunnel was quiet as the grave, and the first unexpected sound they heard was a loud crunch as Ron stepped on what turned out to be a \\nrat™s skull. Harry lowered his wand to look at the floor and saw that it was littered with small \\nanimal bones. Trying very hard not to imagine \\nwhat Ginny might look like if they found her, Harry led the way forward, around a dark bend in \\n\\nthe tunnel.  \\n      ﬁHarry Š there™s something up there Šﬂ\\n said Ron hoarsely, grabbing Harry™s shoulder.  \\n      They froze, watching. Harry could just see the outline of something huge and curved, lying right \\nacross the tunnel. It wasn™t moving. \\n \\n      ﬁMaybe it™s asleep,ﬂ he breathed, glancing back at the other \\ntwo. Lockhart™s hands were pressed over his eyes. Harry turned back to look at the thing, his heart beating so fast it hurt.  \\n      Very slowly, his eyes as narrow as he could make them and still se\\ne, Harry edged forward, his wand held high.  \\n      The light slid over a gigantic snake skin, of a vivid, poisonous green, lying curled and empty \\nacross the tunnel floor. The creature\\n that had shed it must have been twenty feet long at least. \\n \\n      ﬁBlimey,ﬂ said Ron weakly. \\n       There was a sudden movement behind \\nthem. Gilderoy Lockhart™s knees had given way. \\n \\n      ﬁGet up,ﬂ said Ron sharply, pointing his wand at Lockhart.  \\n      Lockhart got to his feet Š then he dived at Ron, knocking him to the ground. \\n\\n \\n      Harry jumped forward, but too late Š Lock\\nhart was straightening up, panting, Ron™s wand in his hand and a gleaming smile back on his face. \\n \\n      ﬁThe adventure ends here, boys!ﬂ he said. ﬁI shall take a bit of this skin back up to the school, tell them I was too late to sa\\nve the girl, and that you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of \\nher mangled body Š say good-bye to your memories!ﬂ \\n \\n      He raised Ron™s Spellotaped wand high over his head and yelled, ﬁObliviate!\\nﬂ  \\n      The wand exploded with the force of a sma\\nll bomb. Harry flung his arms over his head and ran, \\nslipping over the coils of snake skin, out of th\\ne way of great chunks of tunnel ceiling that were thundering to the floor. Next moment, he was st\\nanding alone, gazing at a solid wall of broken rock.       ﬁRon!ﬂ he shouted. ﬁAre you okay? Ron!ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁI™m here!ﬂ came Ron™s muffled voice from\\n behind the rockfall. ﬁI™m okay Š this git™s not, though Š he got blasted by the wand Šﬂ  \\n      There was a dull thud and a loud ﬁow!ﬂ It sounded as though Ron had just kicked Lockhart in the shins.  \\n      ﬁWhat now?ﬂ Ron™s voice said, sounding desp\\nerate. ﬁWe can™t get thr\\nough Š it™ll take ages–ﬂ  \\n      Harry looked up at the tunnel ceiling. Huge cracks had appeared in it. He had never tried to break apart anything as large as these rocks by magi\\nc, and now didn™t seem a good moment to try Š \\n\\nwhat if the whole tunnel caved in? \\n \\n      There was another thud and another ﬁow!ﬂ from behind the rocks. They were wasting time. \\nGinny had already been in the Chamber of Secrets for hours– Harry knew there was only one thing to do.  \\n      ﬁWait there,ﬂ he called to Ron. ﬁWait with\\n Lockhart. I™ll go on– If I™m not back in an hour–ﬂ \\n \\n      There was a very pregnant pause, ﬁI™ll try and shift some of this rock,ﬂ said Ron, who seemed to \\nbe trying to keep his voice steady. ﬁSo you can Š can get back through. And, Harry Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁSee you in a bit,ﬂ said Harry, trying to inject some confidence into his shaking voice. \\n \\n      And he set off alone past the giant snake skin.        Soon the distant noise of Ron straining to shift the rocks was gone. The tunnel turned and turned again. Every nerve in Harry™s body was tingling u\\nnpleasantly. He wanted the tunnel to end, yet dreaded what he™d find when it did. And then, at last, as he crept ar\\nound yet another bend, he saw a solid wall ahead on which two entwined serp\\nents were carved, their eyes set with great, glinting emeralds. \\n \\n      Harry approached, his throat very dry. There was no need to pretend these stone snakes were \\nreal; their eyes looked strangely alive.  \\n      He could guess what he had to do. He cleared his throat, and the emerald eyes seemed to flicker. \\n \\n      ﬁOpen,ﬂ said Harry, in a low, faint hiss. \\n \\n      The serpents parted as the wall cracked \\nopen, the halves slid smoothl\\ny out of sight, and Harry, shaking from head to foot, walked inside.  \\n     CHAPTER SEVENTEEN \\n  The Heir of Slytherin      He was standing at the end of a very long, di\\nmly lit chamber. Towering stone pillars entwined \\nwith more carved serpents rose \\nto support a ceiling lost in darkness, casting long, black shadows through the odd, greenish gloom that filled the pl\\nace. His heart beating very fast, Harry stood listening to the chill silence. Could the basilisk \\nbe lurking in a shadowy corner, behind a pillar? \\nAnd where was Ginny?  \\n      He pulled out his wand and moved forwar\\nd between the serpentine columns. Every careful \\nfootstep echoed loudly off the shadowy walls. He kept his eyes narrowed, ready to clamp them \\nshut at the smallest sign of m\\novement. The hollow eye sockets of the stone snakes seemed to be \\nfollowing him. More than once, with a jolt of the stomach, he thought he saw one stir. \\n \\n      Then, as he drew level with the last pair of pillars, a statue high as the Chamber itself loomed \\ninto view, standing against the back wall. \\n \\n      Harry had to crane his neck to look up in\\nto the giant face above: It was ancient and monkeyish, \\nwith a long, thin beard that fell almost to the \\nbottom of the wizard™s sweeping stone robes, where two enormous gray feet stood on the smooth Ch\\namber floor. And between the feet, facedown, \\nlay a small, black-robed figur\\ne with flaming-red hair. \\n \\n      ﬁGinny!ﬂ Harry muttered, sprinting to he\\nr and dropping to his knees. ﬁGinny Š don™t be dead Š please don™t be dead Šﬂ He flung his wand aside, grabbed Ginny™s shoulders, and turned her over. Her face was white as marble, and as col\\nd, yet her eyes were closed, so she wasn™t \\nPetrified. But then she must be–  \\n \\n      ﬁGinny, please wake up,ﬂ Harry muttered desperately, shaking her. Ginny™s head lolled \\nhopelessly from side to side. \\n \\n      ﬁShe won™t wake,ﬂ said a soft voice. \\n \\n      Harry jumped and spun around on his knees. \\n \\n      A tall, black-haired boy was leaning against the nearest pillar, wa\\ntching. He was strangely blurred around the edges, as though Harry were looking at him through a misted window. But \\nthere was no mistaking him. \\n \\n      ﬁTom Š Tom Riddle?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      Riddle nodded, not taking his eyes off Harry™s face. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁWhat d™you mean, she won™t wake?ﬂ Harr\\ny said desperately. ﬁShe™s not Š she™s not Š?ﬂ \\n       ﬁShe™s still alive,ﬂ said Riddle. ﬁBut only just.ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry stared at him. Tom Riddle had been\\n at Hogwarts fifty years ago, yet here he stood, a weird, misty light shining about him, not a day older than sixteen. \\n \\n      ﬁAre you a ghost?ﬂ Harry said uncertainly. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁA memory,ﬂ said Riddle quietly\\n. ﬁPreserved in a diary for fifty years.ﬂ \\n \\n      He pointed toward the floor near the statue™s giant toes. Lying open \\nthere was the little black \\ndiary Harry had found in Moaning Myrtle™s bathroom. For a second, Harry wondered how it had \\ngot there Š but there were more \\npressing matters to deal with. \\n \\n      ﬁYou™ve got to help me, Tom,ﬂ Harry said, raising Ginny™s head again. ﬁWe™ve got to get her out \\nof here. There™s a basilisk– I don™t know where it is, but it could be along any moment– \\nPlease, help me.ﬂ \\n \\n      Riddle didn™t move. Harry, sweating, managed to\\n hoist Ginny half off the \\nfloor, and bent to pick up his wand again.  \\n      But his wand had gone. \\n \\n      ﬁDid you see Š?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      He looked up. Riddle was still watching him Š twirling Harry™s wand between his long fingers. \\n\\n       ﬁThanks,ﬂ said Harry, stretching out his hand for it.  \\n      A smile curled the corners of Riddle™s m\\nouth. He continued to stare at Harry, twirling the wand idly.  \\n      ﬁListen,ﬂ said Harry urgently, his knees sagging with Ginny™s dead weight. ﬁWe™ve got to go! If \\nthe basilisk comes Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁIt won™t come until \\nit is called,ﬂ said Riddle calmly. \\n \\n      Harry lowered Ginny back onto the floor, unable to hold her up any longer. \\n \\n      ﬁWhat d™you mean?ﬂ he said. ﬁLook, give me my wand, I might need it Šﬂ \\n\\n \\n      Riddle™s smile broadened. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁYou won™t be needing it,ﬂ he said.  \\n      Harry stared at him. \\n\\n       ﬁWhat d™you mean, I won™t be Š?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁI™ve waited a long time for this, Harry Po\\ntter,ﬂ said Riddle. ﬁFor the chance to see you. To speak to you.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁLook,ﬂ said Harry, losing patience, ﬁI don™t think you get it. We™re in the Chamber of Secrets. \\nWe can talk later Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWe™re going to talk now,ﬂ said Riddle,\\n still smiling broadly, and \\nhe pocketed Harry™s wand.  \\n      Harry stared at him. Ther\\ne was something very funny going on here–  \\n \\n      ﬁHow did Ginny get like this?ﬂ he asked slowly. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁWell, that™s an interesting question,ﬂ sa\\nid Riddle pleasantly. ﬁAnd quite a long story. I suppose the real reason Ginny Weasley™s like this is because she opened her heart and spilled all her secrets to an invisible stranger.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWhat are you talking about?ﬂ said Harry. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁThe diary,ﬂ said Riddle. ﬁMy diary. Lit\\ntle Ginny™s been writing in it for months and months, \\ntelling me all her pitiful worries and woes Š how \\nher brothers tease her, how she had to come to \\n\\nschool with secondhand robes and books, how Šﬂ Riddle™s eyes glinted ﬁŠ how she didn™t think famous, good, great Harry Potter would ever like her–ﬂ \\n \\n      All the time he spoke, Ri\\nddle™s eyes never left Harry™s face. There was an almost hungry look in \\nthem. \\n \\n      ﬁIt™s very boring, having to listen to the silly little troubles of an eleven-year-old girl,ﬂ he went on. ﬁBut I was patient. I wrote back. I was symp\\nathetic, I was kind. Ginny simply loved me. No \\none™s ever understood me like you, Tom– I™m so gl\\nad I™ve got this diary to confide in– It™s like having a friend I can carry around in my pocket–ﬂ \\n \\n      Riddle laughed, a high, cold laugh that didn™t suit him. It made the hairs stand up on the back of \\nHarry™s neck. \\n \\n      ﬁIf I say it myself, Harry, I™ve always b\\neen able to charm the people I needed. So Ginny poured out her soul to me, and her soul happened to \\nbe exactly what I wanted– I grew stronger and stronger on a diet of her deepest fears, her darkest secrets. I grew powerful, far more powerful \\nthan little Miss Weasley. Powerful enough to start \\nfeeding Miss Weasley a few of my secrets, to \\nstart pouring a little of my soul back into her–ﬂ  \\n      ﬁWhat d™you mean?ﬂ said Harry, whose mouth had gone very dry. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁHaven™t you guessed yet, Harry Potter?ﬂ said Riddle softly. ﬁGinny Weasley opened the Chamber of Secrets. She strang\\nled the school roosters and daubed threatening messages on the \\nwalls. She set the Serpent of Slytherin on four Mudbloods, and the Squib™s cat.ﬂ \\n       ﬁNo,ﬂ Harry whispered. \\n \\n      ﬁYes,ﬂ said Riddle, calmly. ﬁOf course, sh\\ne didn™t know what she was doing at first. It was very amusing. I wish you could have seen her new \\ndiary entries– far more interesting, they \\nbecame– Dear Tom,ﬂ he recited, watching Harr\\ny™s horrified face, ﬁ‚I think I™m losing my \\nmemory. There are rooster feathers all over my robes and I don™t \\nknow how they got there. Dear Tom, I can™t remember what I did on the night \\nof Halloween, but a cat was attacked and I™ve got paint all down my front. Dear To\\nm, Percy keeps telling me I™m pa\\nle and I™m not myself. I think \\nhe suspects me– There was another attack today \\nand I don™t know where I was. Tom, what am I \\ngoing to do? I think I™m going mad– I thi\\nnk I™m the one attacking everyone, Tom!™ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry™s fists were clenched, the nails digging deep into his palms. \\n \\n      ﬁIt took a very long time \\nfor stupid little Ginny to stop trusting her diary,ﬂ said Riddle. ﬁBut she \\nfinally became suspicious and tried to dispose \\nof it. And that™s where you came in, Harry. You \\nfound it, and I couldn™t have been more delighted\\n. Of all the people who could have picked it up, it was you, the very person I was most anxious to meet–ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁAnd why did you want to meet me?ﬂ sa\\nid Harry. Anger was coursing through him, and it was \\nan effort to keep his voice steady.  \\n      ﬁWell, you see, Ginny told me all a\\nbout you, Harry,ﬂ said Riddle. ﬁYour whole fascinating history.ﬂ His eyes roved over the lightning scar on Harry™s forehead, and their expression grew hungrier. ﬁI knew I must find out \\nmore about you, talk to you, meet you if I could. So I decided \\nto show you my famous capture of that gr\\neat oaf, Hagrid, to gain your trust Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁHagrid™s my friend,ﬂ said Harry, his \\nvoice now shaking. ﬁAnd you framed him, didn™t you? I \\nthought you made a mistake, but Šﬂ \\n \\n      Riddle laughed his high laugh again. \\n \\n      ﬁIt was my word against Hagrid™s, Harry. Well, you can imagine how \\nit looked to old Armando \\nDippet. On the one hand, Tom Riddle, poor but br\\nilliant, parentless but so brave, school prefect, model student– on the other hand, big, blundering Hagrid, in trouble every other week, trying to raise werewolf cubs under his bed, sneaking off to the Forbidden Forest to wrestle trolls– but I admit, even I was surprised how well the plan \\nworked. I thought someone must realize that \\nHagrid couldn™t possibly be the Heir of Slytherin. It had taken me five \\nwhole years to find out everything I could about the Chamber of Secret\\ns and discover the secret entrance– as though Hagrid had the brains, or the power!  \\n      ﬁOnly the Transfiguration teacher, Dumble\\ndore, seemed to think Hagrid was innocent. He \\npersuaded Dippet to keep Hagrid and train him \\nas gamekeeper. Yes, I think Dumbledore might \\nhave guessed– Dumbledore never seemed to like \\nme as much as the other teachers did–ﬂ \\n       ﬁI bet Dumbledore saw right \\nthrough you,ﬂ said Harry, his teeth gritted.  \\n      ﬁWell, he certainly kept an annoyingly \\nclose watch on me after Hagrid was expelled,ﬂ said \\nRiddle carelessly. ﬁI knew it wouldn™t be safe to open the Chamber again while I was still at \\nschool. But I wasn™t going to waste those long years I™d spent search\\ning for it. I decided to leave behind a diary, preserving my sixt\\neen-year-old self in its pages, so that one day, with luck, I would be able to lead another in my footsteps, and finish \\nSalazar Slytherin™s noble work.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWell, you haven™t finished it,ﬂ said Harry\\n triumphantly. ﬁNo one™s died\\n this time, not even the \\ncat. In a few hours the Mandrake Draught will be \\nready and everyone who was Petrified will be \\nall right again Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁHaven™t I already told you,ﬂ said Riddle quietly, ﬁthat killing Mudbloods doesn™t matter to me \\nanymore? For many months now, my new target has been Š you.ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry stared at him. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁImagine how angry I was when the ne\\nxt time my diary was opened, it was Ginny who was \\nwriting to me, not you. She saw you with the diary, you see, and panicked. What if you found out \\nhow to work it, and I repeated all her secrets to you? What if, even worse, I told you who™d been \\nstrangling roosters? So the foolish little brat \\nwaited until your dormitory was deserted and stole it \\nback. But I knew what I must do. It\\n was clear to me that you were \\non the trail of Slytherin™s heir. From everything Ginny had told me about you, I \\nknew you would go to any lengths to solve the mystery Š particularly if one of your best friends was attacked. And Ginny had told me the \\nwhole school was buzzing because you could speak Parseltongue–  \\n       ﬁSo I made Ginny write her own farewell on \\nthe wall and come down here\\n to wait. She struggled and cried and became very boring. But there isn™t much life left in her– She put too much into \\nthe diary, into me. Enough to let me leave its \\npages at last– I have been waiting for you to \\nappear since we arrived here. I knew you™d come. I have many questions for you, Harry Potter.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁLike what?ﬂ Harr\\ny spat, fists still clenched.  \\n      ﬁWell,ﬂ said Riddle, smiling pleasan\\ntly, ﬁhow is it that you Š a skinny boy with no extraordinary magical talent Š managed to defe\\nat the greatest wizard of all time? How did you \\nescape with nothing but a scar, while Lord Voldemort™s powers were destroyed?ﬂ  \\n      There was an odd red gleam in his hungry eyes now. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁWhy do you care how I escaped?ﬂ said \\nHarry slowly. ﬁVoldemort was after your time–ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁVoldemort,ﬂ said Riddle softly, ﬁis my past, present, and future, Harry Potter–ﬂ \\n \\n      He pulled Harry™s wand from his pocket a\\nnd began to trace it through the air, writing three shimmering words: \\n       TOM MARVOLO RIDDLE  \\n      Then he waved the wand once, and the letters of his name \\nrearranged themselves: \\n \\n      I AM LORD VOLDEMORT \\n \\n      ﬁYou see?ﬂ he whispered. ﬁIt was a name I was already using at Hogwarts, to my most intimate \\nfriends only, of course. You think I was going to \\nuse my filthy Muggle father™s name forever? I, \\n\\nin whose veins runs the blood of Salazar Slytherin himself, through my mother™s side? I, keep \\nthe name of a foul, common Muggle, who abandoned \\nme even before I was born, just because he \\nfound out his wife was a witch? No, Harry Š I fashioned myself a new name, a name I knew \\n\\nwizards everywhere would one day fear to speak, when I had become the greatest sorcerer in the \\nworld!ﬂ  \\n      Harry™s brain seemed to have jammed. He \\nstared numbly at Riddle, at the orphaned boy who had \\ngrown up to murder Harry™s own parents, and so many others– At last he forced himself to \\nspeak.  \\n      ﬁYou™re not,ﬂ he said, his quiet voice full of hatred.  \\n      ﬁNot what?ﬂ snapped Riddle. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁNot the greatest sorcerer in the world,ﬂ said Harry, breathing fast. ﬁSorry to disappoint you and \\nall that, but the greatest wizard in the world is \\nAlbus Dumbledore. Everyone says so. Even when \\nyou were strong, you didn™t dare try and take over at Hogwarts. Dumbledore saw through you \\n\\nwhen you were at school and he still frightens you now, wherever you™re hiding these days Šﬂ \\n \\n      The smile had gone from Riddle™s \\nface, to be replaced by a very ugly look.  \\n      ﬁDumbledore™s been dr\\niven out of this castle by the me\\nre memory of me!ﬂ he hissed. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁHe™s not as gone as you might think!ﬂ Ha\\nrry retorted. He was speaking at random, wanting to \\nscare Riddle, wishing rather than believing it to be true.  \\n      Riddle opened his mouth, but froze. \\n\\n \\n      Music was coming from somewhere. Riddle \\nwhirled around to stare down the empty Chamber. \\nThe music was growing louder. \\nIt was eerie, spine-tingling, unearthly; it lifted the hair on Harry™s scalp and made his heart feel as though it\\n was swelling to twice its normal size. Then, as \\nthe music reached such a pitch that Harry felt it \\nvibrating inside his own ribs, flames erupted at \\nthe top of the nearest pillar.  \\n      A crimson bird the size of a swan had app\\neared, piping its weird music \\nto the vaulted ceiling. It had a glittering golden tail as long as a peacock™s and gleaming golden talons, which were \\ngripping a ragged bundle.        A second later, the bird was flying straight at Harry. It dropped the ragged thing it was carrying at his feet, then landed heavily on his shoulder. As\\n it folded its great wings, Harry looked up and saw it had a long, sharp golden beak and a beady black eye.        The bird stopped singing. It sat still and warm next to Harry™s cheek, gazing steadily at Riddle.  \\n      ﬁThat™s a phoenix.ﬂ said Riddle, staring shrewdly back at it.  \\n      ﬁFawkes?ﬂ Harry breathed, and he felt th\\ne bird™s golden claws squeeze his shoulder gently.  \\n      ﬁAnd that Šﬂ said Riddle, now eyeing the ragged thing that Fawkes had dropped, ﬁthat™s the old school Sorting Hat Šﬂ  \\n      So it was. Patched, frayed, and dirty, the hat lay motionless at Harry™s feet. \\n \\n      Riddle began to laugh again. He laughed so hard that the dark chamber rang with it, as though \\nten Riddles were laughing at once.  \\n      ﬁThis is what Dumbledor\\ne sends his defender! A songbird and an old hat! Do you feel brave, Harry Potter? Do you feel safe now?ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry didn™t answer. He might not see what \\nuse Fawkes or the Sorting Hat were, but he was no longer alone, and he waited for Riddle to stop laughing with his courage mounting.  \\n      ﬁTo business, Harry,ﬂ said Riddle, still smiling broadly. ﬁTwice Š in your past, in my future Š \\nwe have met. And twice I failed to kill you. \\nHow did you survive? Tell me everything. The \\nlonger you talk,ﬂ he added softly, ﬁthe longer you stay alive.ﬂ  \\n      Harry was thinking fast, weighing his chances. Riddle had the wand. He, Harry, had Fawkes and \\nthe Sorting Hat, neither of which would be much good in a duel. It\\n looked bad, all right– but the longer Riddle stood there, the more life was \\ndwindling out of Ginny– and in the meantime, \\nHarry noticed suddenly, Riddle™s outline was becoming clearer, more solid– If it had to be a \\nfight between him and Riddle,\\n better sooner than later.  \\n      ﬁNo one knows why you lost your powers when you attacked me,ﬂ said Harry abruptly. ﬁI don™t \\nknow myself. But I know why you c\\nouldn™t kill me. Because my moth\\ner died to save me. My \\ncommon Muggle-born mother,ﬂ he added, shaki\\nng with suppressed rage. ﬁShe stopped you killing me. And I™ve seen the real\\n you, I saw you last year. You™re \\na wreck. You™re barely alive. That™s where all your power got you. You™re in hiding. You™re ugly, you™re foul Šﬂ  \\n      Riddle™s face contorted. Then he forced it in\\nto an awful smile. ﬁSo. Your mother died to save \\nyou. Yes, that™s a powerful countercharm. I can\\n see now– there is nothing special about you, after all. I wondered, you see. Th\\nere are strange likenesses between us, after all. Even you must \\nhave noticed. Both half-bloods, orphans, raised by Muggles. Proba\\nbly the only two Parselmouths \\nto come to Hogwarts since the great Slytherin hi\\nmself. We even look something alike– but after \\nall, it was merely a lucky chance that saved you from me. That™s a\\nll I wanted to know.ﬂ       Harry stood, tense, waiting for Riddle to raise his wand. But Riddle™s twisted smile was \\nwidening again.        ﬁNow, Harry, I™m going to teach you a little \\nlesson. Let™s match the powers of Lord Voldemort, \\nHeir of Salazar Slytherin, against famous Harry Potter, and the best weapons Dumbledore can \\ngive him–ﬂ \\n \\n      He cast an amused eye over Fawkes and \\nthe Sorting Hat, then wa\\nlked away. Harry, fear spreading up his numb legs, watched Riddle stop \\nbetween the high pillars and look up into the \\nstone face of Slytherin, high above him in the \\nhalf-darkness. Riddle opened his mouth wide and \\nhissed Š but Harry understood what he was saying–   \\n      ﬁSpeak to me, Slytherin, \\ngreatest of the Hogwarts Four.ﬂ  \\n      Harry wheeled around to look up at the statue, Fawkes swaying on his shoulder.  \\n      Slytherin™s gigantic stone face was m\\noving. Horrorstruck, Harry saw his mouth opening, wider \\nand wider, to make a huge black hole. \\n \\n      And something was stirring inside the statue™s mouth. Something was slithering up from its \\ndepths.  \\n      Harry backed away until he hit the dark Ch\\namber wall, and as he shut his eyes tight he felt \\nFawkes™ wing sweep his cheek as he took flight. Harry wanted to shout, ﬁDon™t leave me!ﬂ but \\nwhat chance did a phoenix have against the king of serpents?        Something huge hit the stone floor of the \\nChamber. Harry felt it shudder Š he knew what was \\nhappening, he could sense it, could almost see the giant serpent \\nuncoiling itself from Slytherin™s \\nmouth. Then he heard Riddle™s hissing voice:        ﬁKill him.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      The basilisk was moving toward Harry; he\\n could hear its heavy body \\nslithering heavily across \\nthe dusty floor. Eyes still tightly shut, Harry began to run blindly sideways, his hands outstretched, feeling his way Š Voldemort was laughing. \\n \\n      Harry tripped. He fell hard onto the stone and tasted blood the serpent was barely feet from him, \\nhe could hear it coming. \\n \\n      There was a loud, explosive spitting sound right above him, and then something heavy hit Harry \\nso hard that he was smashed into the wall. \\nWaiting for fangs to sink through his body he heard \\nmore mad hissing, something thrashing wildly off the pillars. \\n \\n      He couldn™t help it Š he opened his eyes wide enough to squint at what was going on. \\n \\n      The enormous serpent, bright, poisonous green, thick as an oak trunk, had raised itself high in the air and its great blunt head was weaving drunkenly between the pillars. As Harry trembled, ready \\nto close his eyes if it turned, he saw what had distracted the snake. \\n       Fawkes was soaring around its head, and the basilisk was snapping furiously at him with fangs long and thin as sabers Fawkes dived. His long golden beak sank out of sight and a sudden shower of dark blood spattered the floor. The snake™s tail thrashed, narrowly missing Harry, and \\nbefore Harry could shut his eyes, it turned Š Harry looked straight into it\\ns face and saw that its eyes, both its great, bulbous yellow eyes, had been punctured by the phoenix; blood was \\nstreaming to the floor, and th\\ne snake was spitting in agony.  \\n      ﬁNO!ﬂ Harry heard Riddle screaming. \\nﬁLEAVE THE BIRD! LEAVE THE BIRD! THE BOY IS BEHIND YOU. YOU CAN STILL SMELL HIM. KILL HIM!ﬂ \\n \\n      The blinded serpent swayed, confused, still deadly. Fawkes was circling its head, piping his eerie song, jabbing here and there at its scaly nose as the blood poured from its ruined eyes. \\n \\n      ﬁHelp me, help me,ﬂ Harry muttered wildly, ﬁsomeone Š anyone–ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      The snake™s tail whipped across the floor again. Harry ducked. Something soft hit his face. \\n \\n      The basilisk had swept the Sorting Hat into Ha\\nrry™s arms. Harry seized it. It was all he had left, \\nhis only chance Š he rammed it onto his head and threw himself flat onto the floor as the \\n\\nbasilisk™s tail swung over him again. \\n \\n      Help me Š help me Š Harry thought, his eyes screwed tight under the hat. Please help me.        There was no answering voice. Instead, the hat contracted, as though an invisible hand was squeezing it very tightly. \\n       Something very hard and heavy thudded ont\\no the top of Harry™s head, almost knocking him out. \\nStars winking in front of his eyes, he grabbed the top of the hat to pull it off and felt something \\nlong and hard beneath it.  \\n      A gleaming silver sword had appeared inside \\nthe hat, its handle glitteri\\nng with rubies the size of eggs.  \\n      ﬁKILL THE BOY! LEAVE THE BIRD! THE BOY IS BEHIND YOU. SNIFF Š SMELL HIM.ﬂ  \\n      Harry was on his feet, ready. The basilisk™s head was falling, its body coiling around, hitting pillars as it twisted to face him. He could \\nsee the vast, bloody eye sockets, see the mouth \\n\\nstretching wide, wide enough to sw\\nallow him whole, lined with fa\\nngs long as his sword, thin, glittering, venomous Š \\n \\n      It lunged blindly Š Harry dodged and it hit the Chamber wall. \\nIt lunged again, and its forked tongue lashed Harry™s side. He raised the sword in both his hands Š       The basilisk lunged again, and this time its\\n aim was true Š Harry threw his whole weight behind the sword and drove it to the hilt into the roof \\nof the serpent™s mouth Š        But as warm blood drenched Harry™s arms, \\nhe felt a searing pain just above his elbow. One long, poisonous fang was sinking deeper and deeper into his arm and it splintered as the basilisk \\nkeeled over sideways and fell, twitching, to the floor.  \\n      Harry slid down the wall. He gripped the fang that was spreading poison through his body and wrenched it out of his arm. But he knew it was too late. White-hot pain was spreading slowly and \\nsteadily from the wound. Even as he dropped the fang and watched his own blood soaking his robes, his vision went foggy. The Chamber wa\\ns dissolving in a whirl of dull color.  \\n      A patch of scarlet swam past, and Harry heard a soft clatter of claws beside him. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁFawkes,ﬂ said Harry thickly. ﬁYou were fantastic, Fawkes–ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      He felt the bird lay its beautiful head on the spot where the serpent™s fang had pierced him. \\n \\n      He could hear echoing footsteps and then a dark shadow moved in front of him. \\n \\n      ﬁYou™re dead, Harry Potter,ﬂ said Riddle™s voice above him. ﬁDead. Even Dumbledore™s bird \\nknows it. Do you see what he™s doing, Potter? He™s crying.ﬂ  \\n      Harry blinked. Fawke™s head slid in and out of focus. Thick, pearly tears were trickling down the glossy feathers.        ﬁI™m going to sit here and watch you die,\\n Harry Potter. Take your time. I™m in no hurry.ﬂ \\n       Harry felt drowsy. Everything around him seemed to be spinning. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁSo ends the famous Harry Potter,ﬂ said \\nRiddle™s distant voice. ﬁA\\nlone in the Chamber of Secrets, forsaken by his friends, defeated at last by the Dark Lord he so unwisely challenged. \\nYou™ll be back with your dear Mudblood mother soon, Harry– She bought you twelve years of \\nborrowed time– but Lord Voldemort got \\nyou in the end, as you knew he must–ﬂ \\n \\n      If this is dying, thought Harry, it™s not so bad.  \\n      Even the pain was leaving him–  \\n\\n \\n      But was this dying? Instead of going black, the Chamber seemed to be coming back into focus. \\nHarry gave his head a little shake and there was \\nFawkes, still resting his head on Harry™s arm. A \\npearly patch of tears was shining all around the wound Š except that there was no wound.  \\n      ﬁGet away, bird,ﬂ said Riddle™s voice suddenly. ﬁGet away from him Š I said, get away Šﬂ \\n\\n \\n      Harry raised his head. Riddle was pointing Harry™s wand at Fawkes; there was a bang like a gun, and Fawkes took flight again in a whirl of gold and scarlet.        ﬁPhoenix tears–ﬂ said Riddle quietly, staring at Harry™s arm. ﬁOf \\ncourse– healing powers– I forgot–ﬂ  \\n      He looked into Harry™s face. ﬁBut it makes no \\ndifference. In fact, I prefer it this way. Just you \\nand me, Harry Potter– you and me–ﬂ \\n \\n      He raised the wand–  \\n \\n      Then, in a rush of wings, Fawkes had soared back overhead and something fell into Harry™s lap \\nŠ the diary.  \\n      For a split second, both Harry and Riddle, wand still raised, stared at it. Then, without thinking, without considering, as though he had meant to do it all along, Harry seized the basilisk fang on \\n\\nthe floor next to him and plunged it \\nstraight into the heart of the book.  \\n      There was a long, dreadful, piercing scream. \\nInk spurted out of the diary in torrents, streaming \\nover Harry™s hands, flooding the floor. Riddle wa\\ns writhing and twisting, screaming and flailing \\nand then Š  \\n      He had gone. Harry™s wand fell to the floor with a clatter and there was silence. Silence except for the steady drip drip of ink still oozing from the diary. The basi\\nlisk venom had burned a \\nsizzling hole right through it.  \\n      Shaking all over, Harry pulled himself up. \\nHis head was spinning as though he™d just traveled miles by Floo powder. Slowly, he gathered togeth\\ner his wand and the Sorting Hat, and, with a huge tug, retrieved the glittering sword from the roof \\nof the basilisk™s mouth. \\n \\n      Then came a faint moan from the end \\nof the Chamber. Ginny was stirring. As Harry hurried \\ntoward her, she sat up. Her bemused eyes traveled\\n from the huge form of the dead basilisk, over \\nHarry, in his blood-soaked robes, then to the diary in his hand. She drew a great, shuddering gasp and tears began to pour down her face.  \\n      ﬁHarry Š oh, Harry Š I tried to tell you at b-breakfast, but I c-couldn™t say it in front of Percy Š it was me, Harry Š but I Š I s-swear I d-didn™t\\n mean to Š R-Riddle made me, he t-took me \\nover Š and Š how did you kill that Š that thing? W-where™s Riddle? The last thing I r-\\nremember is him coming out of the diary Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁ It™s all right,ﬂ said Harry, holding up the diary, and showing Ginny the fang hole, ﬁRiddle™s finished. Look! Him and the basilisk. C™\\nmon, Ginny, let™s get \\nout of here Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁI™m going to be expelled!ﬂ Ginny wept as \\nHarry helped her awkwardly to her feet. ﬁI™ve looked forward to coming to Hogwarts ever since B-\\nBill came and n-now I™ll ha\\nve to leave and Š w-\\nwhat™ll Mum and Dad say?ﬂ        Fawkes was waiting for them, hovering in \\nthe Chamber entrance. Harry urged Ginny forward; \\nthey stepped over the motionless coils of the d\\nead basilisk, through the echoing gloom, and back \\ninto the tunnel. Harry heard the stone doors close behind them with a soft hiss. \\n       After a few minutes™ progress up the dark tu\\nnnel, a distant sound of slowly shifting rock reached Harry™s ears. \\n \\n      ﬁRon!ﬂ Harry yelled, speeding up. ﬁGinny™s okay! I™ve got her!ﬂ  \\n      He heard Ron give a strangled cheer, and th\\ney turned the next bend to see his eager face staring \\nthrough the sizable gap he had mana\\nged to make in the rock fall. \\n \\n      ﬁGinny!ﬂ Ron thrust an arm through the gap in\\n the rock to pull her through first. ﬁYou™re alive! I don™t believe it! What happened? How Š what\\n Š where did that bird come from?ﬂ \\n \\n      Fawkes had swooped through the gap after Ginny. \\n \\n      ﬁHe™s Dumbledore™s,ﬂ said Harry, squeezing through himself. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁHow come you™ve got a sword?ﬂ said \\nRon, gaping at the glittering weapon in Harry™s hand.  \\n      ﬁI™ll explain when we get out of here,ﬂ said Harry with a sideways glance at Ginny, who was crying harder than ever.  \\n      ﬁBut Šﬂ \\n       ﬁLater,ﬂ Harry said shortly. He didn™t think it was a good idea to tell Ron yet who™d been \\nopening the Chamber, not in front of\\n Ginny, anyway. ﬁWhere™s Lockhart?ﬂ \\n       ﬁBack there,ﬂ said Ron, s\\ntill looking puzzled but jerking his head up the tunnel toward the pipe. ﬁHe™s in a bad way. Come and see.ﬂ \\n \\n      Led by Fawkes, whose wide scarlet wings emitted a soft golden glow in the darkness, they \\nwalked all the way back to the mouth of the pipe. Gilderoy Lockhart was \\nsitting there, humming \\nplacidly to himself. \\n \\n      ﬁHis memory™s gone,ﬂ said Ron. ﬁThe Memo\\nry Charm backfired. Hit him instead of us. Hasn™t \\ngot a clue who he is, or where he is, or who we are. I told him to come and wait here. He™s a \\ndanger to himself.ﬂ \\n \\n      Lockhart peered good-naturedly up at them all. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁHello,ﬂ he said. ﬁOdd sort of place, this, isn™t it? Do you live here?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁNo,ﬂ said Ron, raising his eyebrows at Harry. \\n       Harry bent down and looked up the long, dark pipe.  \\n      ﬁHave you thought how we™re going to get back up this?ﬂ he said to Ron.  \\n      Ron shook his head, but Fawkes the phoenix had swooped past Harry and was now fluttering in front of him, his beady eyes bright in the da\\nrk. He was waving his long golden tail feathers. \\nHarry looked uncertainly at him. \\n \\n      ﬁHe looks like he wants you to grab hold–ﬂ said Ron, looking perplexed. ﬁBut you™re much too \\nheavy for a bird to pull up there Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁFawkes,ﬂ said Harry, ﬁisn™t an ordinary bird.ﬂ He turned quickly to the others. ﬁWe™ve got to hold on to each other. Ginny, grab Ron™s hand. Professor Lockhart Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁHe means you,ﬂ said Ron sharply to Lockhart. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁYou hold Ginny™s other hand Šﬂ \\n \\n      Harry tucked the sword and the Sorting Hat \\ninto his belt, Ron took hold of the back of Harry™s robes, and Harry reached out and took hold \\nof Fawkes™s strangely hot tail feathers. \\n \\n      An extraordinary lightness seemed to spread through his whole body and the next second, in a rush of wings, they were flying upward through the pipe. Harry could hear Lockhart dangling \\nbelow him, saying, ﬁAmazing! Amazing! This is \\njust like magic!ﬂ The chill air was whipping \\nthrough Harry™s hair, and before he™d stopped enjoying the ride, it was over Š all four of them \\nwere hitting the wet floor of Moaning Myrtle™s bathroom, and as Lockhart \\nstraightened his hat, the sink that hid the pipe wa\\ns sliding back into place. \\n \\n      Myrtle goggled at them. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁYou™re alive,ﬂ she said blankly to Harry. \\n \\n      ﬁThere™s no need to sound so disappointed,ﬂ he said grimly, wiping flecks of blood and slime off \\nhis glasses.  \\n      ﬁOh, well– I™d just been thinking– if you had died, you™d have been welcome to share my \\ntoilet,ﬂ said Myrtle, blushing silver.  \\n      ﬁUrgh!ﬂ said Ron as they left the bathroom for the dark, de\\nserted corridor outside. ﬁHarry! I think Myrtle™s grown fond of you! You™ve got competition, Ginny!ﬂ \\n \\n      But tears were still flooding silently down Ginny™s face. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁWhere now?ﬂ said Ron, with \\nan anxious look at Ginny. Harry pointed.  \\n      Fawkes was leading the way, glowing gold along the corridor. They strode after him, and moments later, found themselves outsi\\nde Professor McGonagall™s office.        Harry knocked and pushed the door open. \\n \\n          \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n CHAPTER EIGHTEEN   Dobby™s Reward  \\n  For a moment there was silence as Harry, \\nRon, Ginny, and Lockhart stood in the doorway, covered in muck and slime and (in Harry\\n™s case) blood. Then there was a scream. \\n \\n      ﬁGinny!ﬂ \\n \\n      It was Mrs. Weasley, who had been sitting \\ncrying in front of the fire. She leapt to her feet, \\nclosely followed by Mr. Weasley, and both of them flung themselves on their daughter. \\n \\n      Harry, however, was looking past them. Pr\\nofessor Dumbledore was standing by the mantelpiece, \\nbeaming, next to Professor McGonagall, who wa\\ns taking great, steadying gasps, clutching her chest. Fawkes went whooshing past Harry™s ear and settled on Dumbledor\\ne™s shoulder, just as Harry found himself and Ron being swept \\ninto Mrs. Weasley™s tight embrace. \\n \\n      ﬁYou saved her! You saved her! How did you do it?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁI think we™d all like to know that,ﬂ said Professor McGonagall weakly.  \\n      Mrs. Weasley let go of Harry, who hesitated \\nfor a moment, then walked over to the desk and laid \\nupon it the Sorting Hat, the ruby-encrusted sword, and what remained of Riddle™s diary. \\n \\n      Then he started telling them everything. For \\nnearly a quarter of an hour he spoke into the rapt silence: He told them about hearing the disem\\nbodied voice, how Hermione had finally realized \\nthat he was hearing a basilisk in the pipes; how he and Ron had followed the spiders into the \\nforest, that Aragog had told them where the last\\n victim of the basilisk had died; how he had \\nguessed that Moaning Myrtle had been the victim, and that the entrance to the Chamber of \\n\\nSecrets might be in her bathroom–  \\n \\n      ﬁVery well,ﬂ Professor McGonagall prompted him as he paused, ﬁso you found out where the \\nentrance was Š breaking a hundred school rules \\ninto pieces along the way, I might add Š but \\nhow on earth did you all get out of there alive, Potter?ﬂ \\n \\n      So Harry, his voice now growing hoarse from all this talking, told them about Fawkes™s timely \\narrival and about the Sorting Hat giving him th\\ne sword. But then he faltered. He had so far avoided mentioning Riddle™s di\\nary Š or Ginny. She was standing with her head against Mrs. Weasley™s shoulder, and tears were still coursing silently down her cheeks. Wh\\nat if they expelled her? Harry thought in panic. Ri\\nddle™s diary didn™t work anymore– How could they prove it had been he who™d made her do it all? \\n \\n      Instinctively, Harry looked at Dumbledore, who smiled faintly, the firelight glancing off his half-\\nmoon spectacles.        ﬁWhat interests me most,ﬂ said Dumb\\nledore gently, ﬁis how Lord Voldemort managed to \\nenchant Ginny, when my sources tell me he is \\ncurrently in hiding in the forests of Albania.ﬂ        Relief Š warm, sweeping, glorious reli\\nef Œ swept over Harry. ﬁW-what™s that?ﬂ said Mr. \\nWeasley in a stunned voice. ﬁYou-Know-Who?\\n En-enchant Ginny? But Ginny™s not– Ginny \\nhasn™t been– has she?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁIt was this diary,ﬂ said Harry quickly, picking it up and showing it to Dumbledore. ﬁRiddle \\nwrote it when he was sixteen–ﬂ  \\n      Dumbledore took the diary from Harry a\\nnd peered keenly down his long, crooked nose at its burnt and soggy pages.  \\n      ﬁBrilliant,ﬂ he said softly. ﬁOf course, \\nhe was probably the most brilliant student Hogwarts has \\never seen.ﬂ He turned around to the Weasleys, who were looking utterly bewildered.  \\n      ﬁVery few people know that Lord Voldemort was once called Tom Riddle. I taught him myself, \\nfifty years ago, at Hogwarts. He disappeared after leaving the school– traveled far and wide– \\n\\nsank so deeply into the Dark Arts, consorted wi\\nth the very worst of our kind, underwent so many \\ndangerous, magical transformations, \\nthat when he resurfaced as Lord Voldemort, he was barely \\nrecognizable. Hardly anyone connected Lord Voldemort with the clever, handsome boy who was \\nonce Head Boy here.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁBut, Ginny,ﬂ said Mrs. Weasley. ﬁW\\nhat™s our Ginny got to do with Š with Š him?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁHis d-diaryﬂ Ginny sobbed. ﬁI™ve b-been wri\\nting in it, and he™s been w-writing back all year Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁGinny!ﬂ said Mr. Weasley, flabbergasted. ﬁHaven™t I taught you anything. What have I always \\ntold you? Never trust anything th\\nat can think for itself if you can™t see where it keeps its brain? Why didn™t you show the diary to me, or\\n your mother? A suspicio\\nus object like that, it was clearly full of Dark Magic!™  \\n      ﬁI d-didn™t know,ﬂ sobbed Ginny. ﬁI found it inside one of the books Mum got me. I th-thought \\nsomeone had just left it in th\\nere and forgotten about it Šﬂ  \\n      ﬁMiss Weasley should go up to the hospital wing right away,ﬂ Dumbledor\\ne interrupted in a firm \\nvoice. ﬁThis has been a terrible ordeal for her. There will be no punishment. Older and wiser \\nwizards than she have been hoodwinked by Lord Voldemort.ﬂ He strode over to the door and \\nopened it. ﬁBed rest and perhaps a large, steami\\nng mug of hot chocolate.\\n I always find that cheers me up,ﬂ he added, twinkling kindly down \\nat her. ﬁYou will find that Madam Pomfrey is \\nstill awake. She™s just giving out Mandrake juic\\ne Š I daresay the basilisk™s victims will be \\nwaking up any moment.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁSo Hermione™s okay!ﬂ said Ron brightly. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁThere has been no lasting harm done, Ginny,ﬂ said Dumbledore. \\n      Mrs. Weasley led Ginny out, and Mr. \\nWeasley followed, still looking deeply shaken. \\n       ﬁYou know, Minerva,ﬂ Professor Dumbledore \\nsaid thoughtfully to Professor McGonagall, ﬁI think all this merits a good feast. Might \\nI ask you to go and alert the kitchens?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁRight,ﬂ said Professor McGonagall crisply, also moving to the \\ndoor. ﬁI™ll leave you to deal with Potter and Weasley, shall I?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁCertainly,ﬂ said Dumbledore. \\n \\n      She left, and Harry and Ron gazed uncertainly at Dumbledore. What exactly had Professor \\nMcGonagall meant, deal with \\nthem? Surely Š surely Š they \\nweren™t about to be punished? \\n \\n      ﬁI seem to remember telling you both th\\nat I would have to expel you if you broke any more \\nschool rules,ﬂ said Dumbledore. \\n \\n      Ron opened his mouth in horror. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁWhich goes to show that the best of \\nus must sometimes eat our words,ﬂ Dumbledore went on, \\nsmiling. ﬁYou will both receive Spec\\nial Awards for Services to the School and Š let me see Š \\nyes, I think two hundred points apiece for Gryffindor.ﬂ  \\n      Ron went as brightly pink as Lockhart™s valentine flowers and closed his mouth again. \\n \\n      ﬁBut one of us seems to be keeping mightily\\n quiet about his part in this dangerous adventure,ﬂ \\nDumbledore added. ﬁWhy so modest, Gilderoy?ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry gave a start. He had completely \\nforgotten about Lockhart. He turned and saw that Lockhart was standing in a corner of the room, still wearing his vague smile. When Dumbledore \\naddressed him, Lockhart looked over his shoulder to see who he was talking to.  \\n      ﬁProfessor Dumbledore,ﬂ Ron said quickly, \\nﬁthere was an accident down in the Chamber of \\nSecrets. Professor Lockhart Šﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁAm I a professor?ﬂ said Lockhart in mild\\n surprise. ﬁGoodness. I expect I was hopeless, was I?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁHe tried to do a Memory Charm and the wand backfired,ﬂ Ron explained quietly to Dumbledore. \\n \\n      ﬁDear me,ﬂ said Dumbledore, shaking his head, his long silver mu\\nstache quivering. ﬁImpaled \\nupon your own sword, Gilderoy!ﬂ  \\n      ﬁSword?ﬂ said Lockhart dimly. ﬁHaven™t\\n got a sword. That boy has, though.ﬂ He pointed at Harry. ﬁHe™ll lend you one.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁWould you mind taking Professor Lockhart \\nup to the infirmary, too?ﬂ \\nDumbledore said to Ron. \\nﬁI™d like a few more words with Harry–ﬂ \\n       Lockhart ambled out. Ron cast a curious l\\nook back at Dumbledore and Harry as he closed the door.  \\n      Dumbledore crossed to one of the chairs by the fire. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁSit down, Harry,ﬂ he said, and Harry sat, feeling \\nunaccountably nervous. \\n \\n      ﬁFirst of all, Harry, I want to thank you,ﬂ said Dumbledore, eyes \\ntwinkling again. ﬁYou must \\nhave shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber.\\n Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to \\nyou.ﬂ  \\n      He stroked the phoenix, which had fluttered down onto his knee. Harry grinned awkwardly as Dumbledore watched him. \\n \\n      ﬁAnd so you met Tom Riddle,ﬂ said Dumbledor\\ne thoughtfully. ﬁI imagine he was most interested \\nin you–ﬂ  \\n      Suddenly, something that was naggi\\nng at Harry came tumbling out of his mouth. \\n \\n      ﬁProfessor Dumbledore– Riddle said \\nI™m like him. Strange likenesses, he said–ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁDid he, now?ﬂ said Dumbledore, looking \\nthoughtfully at Harry from under his thick silver eyebrows. ﬁAnd what do you think, Harry?ﬂ \\n       ﬁI don™t think I™m like him!ﬂ said Harry, more\\n loudly than he™d intended. ﬁI mean, I™m Š I™m in \\nGryffindor, I™m–ﬂ \\n       But he fell silent, a lurking doubt resurfacing in his mind. \\n \\n      ﬁProfessor,ﬂ he started again after a moment\\n. ﬁThe Sorting Hat told me I™d Š I™d have done well \\nin Slytherin. Everyone thought I was Slytherin™s heir for a while– because I can speak \\nParseltongue–ﬂ  \\n      ﬁYou can speak Parseltongue, Harry,ﬂ said Dumbledore calmly, ﬁbecause Lord Voldemort Š \\nwho is the last remaining ancestor of Salazar Slytherin Š can speak Parseltongue. Unless I™m \\n\\nmuch mistaken, he transferred some of his own \\npowers to you the night he gave you that scar. Not something he intended to do, I™m sure–ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁVoldemort put a bit of himself in me?ﬂ Harry said, thunderstruck. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁIt certainly seems so.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁSo I should be in Slytherin,ﬂ Harry sai\\nd, looking desperately into Dumbledore™s face. ﬁThe \\nSorting Hat could see Slytherin™s power in me, and it Šﬂ \\n      ﬁPut you in Gryffindor,ﬂ said Dumbledore calmly. ﬁListen to me, Harry. You happen to have \\nmany qualities Salazar Slytherin prized in his hand-picked students. His own very rare gift, \\nParseltongue Š resourcefulness Š determination Š a certain disregard for rules,ﬂ he added, his \\nmustache quivering again. ﬁYet the Sorting Ha\\nt placed you in Gryffindor. You know why that was. Think.ﬂ  \\n      ﬁIt only put me in Gryffindor,ﬂ said Harry \\nin a defeated voice, ﬁbecause I asked not to go in Slytherin–ﬂ  \\n      ﬁExactly, ﬁsaid Dumbledore, beaming once \\nmore. ﬁWhich makes you ve\\nry different from Tom \\nRiddle. It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.ﬂ Harry \\nsat motionless in his chair, st\\nunned. ﬁIf you want proof, Harry, that you belong in Gryffindor, I suggest you look more closely at this.ﬂ \\n \\n      Dumbledore reached across to Professor Mc\\nGonagall™s desk, picked up the blood-stained silver sword, and handed it to Harry. Dully, Harry turned it over, the rubies blazing in the firelight. And then he saw the name engraved just below the hilt. \\n \\n      Godric Gryffindor \\n \\n      ﬁOnly a true Gryffindor could have pulled that out of the hat, Harry,ﬂ said Dumbledore simply. \\n \\n      For a minute, neither of them spoke. \\nThen Dumbledore pulled open one of the drawers in Professor McGonagall™s desk and took out a quill and a bottle of ink.  \\n      ﬁWhat you need, Harry, is some food and sl\\neep. I suggest you go down to the feast, while I write to Azkaban Šwe need our gamekeeper back. And \\nI must draft an advertisement for the Daily \\nProphet, too,ﬂ he added Thoughtfully. ﬁWe™ll be needing a new Defense Against the Dark Arts \\n\\nteacher– Dear me, we do seem to run through them, don™t we?ﬂ \\n \\n      Harry got up and crossed to the door. He \\nhad just reached for the handle, however, when the door burst open so violently that it bounced back off the wall.  \\n      Lucius Malfoy stood there, fury in his \\nface. And cowering behind his legs, heavily wrapped in \\nbandages, was Dobby.  \\n      ﬁGood evening, Lucius,ﬂ said Dumbledore pleasantly. \\n \\n      Mr. Malfoy almost knocked Harry over as he\\n swept into the room. Dobby \\nwent scurrying in after him, crouching at the hem of his cloak, a look of abject terror on his face. \\n \\n      The elf was carrying a stained rag with which he was attempting to finish cleaning Mr. Malfoys \\nshoes. Apparently Mr. Malfoy had set out in a great hurry, for not only were his shoes half-\\npolished, but his usually sleek hair was dish\\neveled. Ignoring the elf bobbing apologetically around his ankles, he fixed his cold eyes upon Dumbledore.        ﬁSo!ﬂ he said ﬁYou™ve come back. The gove\\nrnors suspended you, but you still saw fit to return to \\nHogwarts.ﬂ        ﬁWell, you see, Lucius,ﬂ said Dumble\\ndore, smiling serenely, ﬁthe other eleven governors \\ncontacted me today. It was something like being ca\\nught in a hailstorm of \\nowls, to tell the truth. They™d heard that Arthur Weasleys daughter had b\\neen killed and wanted me back here at once. \\nThey seemed to think I was the best man for the \\njob after all. Very strange tales they told me, \\ntoo– Several of them seemed to think that you ha\\nd threatened to curse their families if they \\ndidn™t agree to suspend me in the first place.ﬂ \\n \\n      Mr. Malfoy went even paler than usual, but his eyes were still slits of fury.  \\n      ﬁSo Š have you stopped the attacks yet?ﬂ he sneered. ﬁHave you caught the culprit?ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      ﬁWe have,ﬂ said Dumbledore, with a smile. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁWell?ﬂ said Mr. \\nMalfoy sharply. ﬁWho is it?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁThe same person as last time, Lucius,ﬂ \\nsaid Dumbledore. ﬁBut this time, Lord Voldemort was \\nacting through somebody else. \\nBy means of this diary.ﬂ  \\n      He held up the small black book with th\\ne large hole through the center, watching Mr. Malfoy closely. Harry, however, was watching Dobby.  \\n      The elf was doing something very odd. His \\ngreat eyes fixed meaningfully on Harry, he kept \\npointing at the diary, then at Mr. Malfoy, and then hitting himself hard on the head with his fist. \\n \\n      ﬁI see–ﬂ said Mr. Malfoy slowly to Dumbledore. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁA clever plan,ﬂ said Dumbledore in a level voice, still star\\ning Mr. Malfoy straight in the eye. ﬁBecause if Harry here Šﬂ Mr. Malfoy shot Harry a swift, sharp look ﬁand his friend Ron hadn™t \\ndiscovered this book, why Š Ginny Weasley might have\\n taken all the blame. No one would ever \\nhave been able to prove she hadn™t acted of her own free will–ﬂ  \\n      Mr. Malfoy said nothing. His face was suddenly masklike. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁAnd imagine,ﬂ Dumbledore went on, ﬁwhat might have happened then– The Weasleys are one \\nof our most prominent pure-blood families. Im\\nagine the effect on Arthur Weasley and his \\nMuggle Protection Act, if his own daughter was discovered attacking and Š killing Muggle-\\nborns– Very fortunate the diary was discovered, and Riddle™s memories wiped from it. Who \\nknows what the consequences might have been otherwise–ﬂ \\n \\n      Mr. Malfoy forced himself to speak. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁVery fortunate,ﬂ he said stiffly. \\n       And still, behind his back, Dobby was pointing, first to the diary, then to Lucius Malfoy, then punching himself in the head. \\n       And Harry suddenly understood. He nodded at Dobby, and Dobby backed into a corner, now twisting his ears in punishment. \\n \\n      ﬁDon™t you want to know how Ginny got\\n hold of that diary, Mr. Malfoy?ﬂ said Harry. \\n \\n      Lucius Malfoy rounded on him. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁHow should I know how the stupid little girl got hold of it?ﬂ he said. \\n \\n      ﬁBecause you gave it to her,ﬂ said Harry. ﬁIn Flourish and Blotts. You picked up her old \\nTransfiguration book and slipped the diary inside it, didn™t you?ﬂ \\n \\n      He saw Mr. Malfoy™s white hands clench and unclench. \\n \\n      ﬁProve it,ﬂ he hissed. \\n \\n      ﬁOh, no one will be able to do that,ﬂ said\\n Dumbledore, smiling at Harry. ﬁNot now that Riddle \\nhas vanished from the book. On the other hand, I \\nwould advise you, Lucius, not to go giving out any more of Lord Voldemort™s old school things\\n. If any more of them find their way into \\ninnocent hands, I think Arthur Weasley, for one, w\\nill make sure they are traced back to you–ﬂ \\n \\n      Lucius Malfoy stood for a moment, and Ha\\nrry distinctly saw his right hand twitch as though he was longing to reach for his wand. Instead, he turned to his house-elf. ﬁWe™re going, Dobby!ﬂ  \\n      He wrenched open the door and as the elf came hurrying up to him, he kicked him right through \\nit. They could hear Dobby squealing with pain all the way along the corridor. Harry stood for a moment, thinking hard. Then it came to him Š \\n \\n      ﬁProfessor Dumbledore,ﬂ he said hurriedly. \\nﬁCan I give that diary back to Mr. Malfoy, please?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁCertainly, Harry,ﬂ said Dumbledore calmly\\n. ﬁBut hurry. The feast, remember–ﬂ Harry grabbed \\nthe diary and dashed out of the office. He could hear Dobby™s squeals of pain receding around the corner. Quickly, wondering if this plan could possibly work, Harry took off one of his shoes, pulled off his slimy, filthy sock, and stuffed the diar\\ny into it. Then he ran down the dark corridor.  \\n      He caught up with them at the top of the stairs. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁMr. Malfoy,ﬂ he gasped, skidding to a halt, ﬁI™ve got something for you Šﬂ  \\n      And he forced the smelly sock into Lucius Malfoy™s hand.  \\n      ﬁWhat the Š?ﬂ \\n\\n       Mr. Malfoy ripped the sock off the diary, threw it aside, then looked furiously from the ruined book to Harry. ﬁYou™ll meet the same sticky end \\nas your parents one of these days, Harry Potter,ﬂ he said softly. ﬁThey were meddlesome fools, too.ﬂ \\n       He turned to go. \\n \\n      ﬁCome, Dobby. I said, come.ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      But Dobby didn™t move. He was holding up Ha\\nrry™s disgusting, slimy so\\nck, and looking at it as though it were a priceless treasure.  \\n      ﬁMaster has given a sock,ﬂ said the elf in wonderment. ﬁMaster gave it to Dobby.ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁWhat™s that?ﬂ spat \\nMr. Malfoy. ﬁWhat did you say?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁGot a sock,ﬂ said Dobby in disbelie\\nf. ﬁMaster threw it, and Dobby caught it, and Dobby Š Dobby is free.ﬂ  \\n      Lucius Malfoy stood frozen, staring at the elf then he lunged at Harry.  \\n      ﬁYou™ve lost me my servant, boy!ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      But Dobby shouted, ﬁYou shall not harm Harry Potter!ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      There was a loud bang, and Mr. Malfoy was thrown backward. He crashed down the stairs, three at a time, landing in a crumpled heap on the land\\ning below. He got up, his face livid, and pulled out his wand, but Dobby raised a long, threatening finger.  \\n      ﬁYou shall go now,ﬂ he said fiercely, pointing down at Mr. Malfoy. ﬁYou shall not touch Harry Potter. You shall go now.ﬂ \\n \\n      Lucius Malfoy had no choice. With a last, in\\ncensed stare at the pair of them, he swung his cloak \\naround him and hurried out of sight. \\n \\n      ﬁHarry Potter freed Dobby!ﬂ said the elf sh\\nrilly, gazing up at Harry, moonlight from the nearest \\nwindow reflected in his orb-like eyes. ﬁHarry Potter set Dobby free!ﬂ  \\n      ﬁLeast I could do, Dobby,ﬂ said Harry, grinning. ﬁJust promise never to try and save my life \\nagain.ﬂ  \\n      The elf™s ugly brown face split suddenly into a wide, toothy smile. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁI™ve just got one question, Dobby,ﬂ said Harry as Dobby pulled on Harry™s sock with shaking \\nhands. ﬁYou told me all this had nothing to do with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, remember? \\n\\nWell Šﬂ \\n       ﬁIt was a clue, sir,ﬂ said Dobby, his eyes widening, as though this was obvious. ﬁWas giving you a clue. The Dark Lord, before he changed his name, could be freely named, you see?ﬂ \\n       ﬁRight,ﬂ said Harry weakly. ﬁWell, I™d better go. There™s a feast, and my friend Hermione should \\nbe awake by now–ﬂ  \\n      Dobby threw his arms around Harry™s middle and hugged him. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁHarry Potter is greater by far than Dobby knew!ﬂ he sobbed. ﬁFarewell, Harry Potter!ﬂ \\n\\n \\n      And with a final loud crack, Dobby disappeared. \\n \\n  Harry had been to several Hogwarts feasts, but\\n never one quite like this. Everybody was in their pajamas, and the celebration lasted all night\\n. Harry didn™t know whether the best bit was \\nHermione running toward him, screaming ﬁYou solv\\ned it! You solved it!ﬂ or Justin hurrying over from the Hufflepuff table to wring. his hand \\nand apologize endlessly for suspecting him, or \\nHagrid turning up at half past three, cuffing Ha\\nrry and Ron so hard on the shoulders that they were knocked into their plates of trifle, or \\nhis and Ron™s four hundred points for Gryffindor securing the House Cup for the second year running, or Professor McGonagall standing up to tell them all that the exams had been canceled as \\na school treat (ﬁOh, no!ﬂ said Hermione), or \\nDumbledore announcing that, unfortunately, Professo\\nr Lockhart would be unable to return next year, owing to the fact that he needed to go away and get his memory back. Quite a few of the \\nteachers joined in the cheering that greeted this news. \\n \\n      ﬁShame,ﬂ said Ron, helping himself \\nto a jam doughnut. ﬁHe has starting to grow on me.ﬂ \\n   The rest of the final term passed in a haze of\\n blazing sunshine. Hogwarts was back to normal \\nwith only a few, small differences Š Defense Agai\\nnst the Dark Arts classes were canceled (ﬁbut \\nwe™ve had plenty of practice at\\n that anyway,ﬂ Ron told a disgruntled Hermione) and Lucius \\nMalfoy had been sacked as a school governor. Draco was no longer strutting around the school \\nas though he owned the place. On the contrary, he\\n looked resentful and sulky. On the other hand, Ginny Weasley was perfectly happy again. \\n \\n      Too soon, it was time for the journey home on the Hogwarts Express. Harry, Ron, Hermione, \\nFred, George, and Ginny got a compartment to them\\nselves. They made the most of the last few \\nhours in which they were allowed to do magic before the holidays. They played Exploding Snap, \\n\\nset off the very last of Fred and George™s Filibuster fireworks, and practiced disarming each \\n\\nother by magic. Harry was getting very good at it. \\n \\n      They were almost at King™s \\nCross when Harry remembered something. \\n \\n      ﬁGinny Œ what did you see Percy doing, that he didn™t want you to tell anyone?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁOh, that,ﬂ said Ginny, giggling. ﬁWell Š \\nPercy™s got a girlfriend.ﬂ Fred dropped a stack of books on George™s head.        ﬁWhat?ﬂ \\n \\n      ﬁIt™s that Ravenclaw prefect, Penelope Cl\\nearwater,ﬂ said Ginny. ﬁTha\\nt™s who he was writing to all last summer. He™s been meeting her all over \\nthe school in secret. I walked in on them kissing \\nin an empty classroom one day. He was so upset when she was Š you know Š attacked. You \\n\\nwon™t tease him, will you?ﬂ she added anxiously. \\n \\n      ﬁWouldn™t dream of it,ﬂ said Fred, \\nwho was looking like his birthday had come early. \\n \\n      ﬁDefinitely not,ﬂ said George, sniggering.  \\n      The Hogwarts Express slowed and finally stopped. \\n\\n \\n      Harry pulled out his quill and a bit of parchment and turned to Ron and Hermione. \\n\\n \\n      ﬁThis is called a telephone number,ﬂ he told\\n Ron, scribbling it twice, tearing the parchment in \\ntwo, and handing it to them. ﬁI told your dad ho\\nw to use a telephone last summer Š he™ll know.

I can™t stand anot\\nher two months with only\\n Dudley to talk to–ﬂ  \\n      ﬁYour aunt and uncle will be proud, though, w\\non™t they?ﬂ said Hermione as they got off the train \\nand joined the crowd thronging toward the enchanted barrier. ﬁWhen they hear what you did this \\nyear?ﬂ  \\n      ﬁProud?ﬂ said Harry. ﬁAre you crazy?

      "['Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets By J.K. Rowling CHAPTER ONE The Worst Birthday Not for the first time, an argument had broken out over breakfast at number four, Privet Drive. Mr. Vernon Dursley had been woken in the early hours of the morning by a loud, hooting noise from his nephew Harry\\'s room. \"Third time this week!\" he roared across the table. \"If you can\\'t control that owl, it\\'ll have to go!\" Harry tried, yet again, to explain. \"She\\'s bored,\" he said. \"She\\'s used to flying around outside. If I could just let her out at night -\" \"Do I look stupid?\" snarled Uncle Vernon, a bit of fried egg dangling from his bushy mustache. \"I know what\\'ll happen if that owl\\'s let out.\" He exchanged dark looks with his wife, Petunia. Harry tried to argue back but his words were drowned by a long, loud belch from the Dursleys\\' son, Dudley. \"I want more bacon.\" \"There\\'s more in the frying pan, sweetums,\" said Aunt Petunia, turning misty eyes on her massive son. \"We must build you up while we\\'ve got the chance– I don\\'t like the sound of that school food–\" \"Nonsense, Petunia, I never went hungry when I was at Smeltings,\" said Uncle Vernon heartily. \"Dudley gets enough, don\\'t you, son?\" Dudley, who was so large his bottom drooped over either side of the kitchen chair, grinned and turned to Harry. \"Pass the frying pan.\" \"You\\'ve forgotten the magic word,\" said Harry irritably. The effect of this simple sentence on the rest of the family was incredible: Dudley gasped and fell off his chair with a crash that shook the whole kitchen; Mrs. Dursley gave a small scream and clapped her hands to her mouth; Mr. Dursley jumped to his feet, veins throbbing in his temples. \"I meant ‚please\\'!\" said Harry quickly. \"I didn\\'t mean - \" \"WHAT HAVE I TOLD YOU,\" thundered his uncle, spraying spit over the table, \"ABOUT SAYING THE ‚M\\' WORD IN OUR HOUSE?\" \"But I - \" \"HOW DARE YOU THREATEN DUDLEY!\" roared Uncle Vernon, pounding the table with his fist. \"I just - \" \"I WARNED YOU! I WILL NOT TOLERATE MENTION OF YOUR ABNORMALITY UNDER THIS ROOF!\" Harry stared from his purple-faced uncle to his pale aunt, who was trying to heave Dudley to his feet. \"All right,\" said Harry, \"all right–\" Uncle Vernon sat back down, breathing like a winded rhinoceros and watching Harry closely out of the corners of his small, sharp eyes. Ever since Harry had come home for the summer holidays, Uncle Vernon had been treating him like a bomb that might go off at any moment, because Harry Potter wasn\\'t a normal boy. As a matter of fact, he was as not normal as it is possible to be. Harry Potter was a wizard - a wizard fresh from his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. And if the Dursleys were unhappy to have him back for the holidays, it was nothing to how Harry felt. He missed Hogwarts so much it was like having a constant stomachache. He missed the castle, with its secret passageways and ghosts, his classes (though perhaps not Snape, the Potions master), the mail arriving by owl, eating banquets in the Great Hall, sleeping in his four-poster bed in the tower dormitory, visiting the gamekeeper, Hagrid, in his cabin next to the Forbidden Forest in the grounds, and, especially, Quidditch, the most popular sport in the wizarding world (six tall goal posts, four flying balls, and fourteen players on broomsticks). All Harry\\'s spellbooks, his wand, robes, cauldron, and top-of-the-line Nimbus Two Thousand broomstick had been locked in a cupboard under the stairs by Uncle Vernon the instant Harry had come home. What did the Dursleys care if Harry lost his place on the House Quidditch team because he hadn\\'t practiced all summer? What was it to the Dursleys if Harry went back to school without any of his homework done? The Dursleys were what wizards called Muggles (not a drop of magical blood in their veins), and as far as they were concerned, having a wizard in the family was a matter of deepest shame. Uncle Vernon had even padlocked Harry\\'s owl, Hedwig, inside her cage, to stop her from carrying messages to anyone in the wizarding world. Harry looked nothing like the rest of the family. Uncle Vernon was large and neckless, with an enormous black mustache; Aunt Petunia was horse-faced and bony; Dudley was blond, pink, and porky. Harry, on the other hand, was small and skinny, with brilliant green eyes and jet-black hair that was always untidy. He wore round glasses, and on his forehead was a thin, lightning-shaped scar. It was this scar that made Harry so particularly unusual, even for a wizard. This scar was the only hint of Harry\\'s very mysterious past, of the reason he had been left on the Dursleys\\' doorstep eleven years before. At the age of one year old, Harry had somehow survived a curse from the greatest Dark sorcerer of all time, Lord Voldemort, whose name most witches and wizards still feared to speak. Harry\\'s parents had died in Voldemort\\'s attack, but Harry had escaped with his lightning scar, and somehow - nobody understood why - Voldemort\\'s powers had been destroyed the instant he had failed to kill Harry. So Harry had been brought up by his dead mother\\'s sister and her husband. He had spent ten years with the Dursleys, never understanding why he kept making odd things happen without meaning to, believing the Dursleys\\' story that he had got his scar in the car crash that had killed his parents. And then, exactly a year ago, Hogwarts had written to Harry, and the whole story had come out. Harry had taken up his place at wizard school, where he and his scar were famous– but now the school year was over, and he was back with the Dursleys for the summer, back to being treated like a dog that had rolled in something smelly. The Dursleys hadn\\'t even remembered that today happened to be Harry\\'s twelfth birthday. Of course, his hopes hadn\\'t been high; they\\'d never given him a real present, let alone a cake - but to ignore it completely– At that moment, Uncle Vernon cleared his throat importantly and said, \"Now, as we all know, today is a very important day.\" Harry looked up, hardly daring to believe it. \"This could well be the day I make the biggest deal of my career,\" said Uncle Vernon. Harry went back to his toast. Of course, he thought bitterly, Uncle Vernon was talking about the stupid dinner party. He\\'d been talking of nothing else for two weeks. Some rich builder and his wife were coming to dinner and Uncle Vernon was hoping to get a huge order from him (Uncle Vernon\\'s company made drills). \"I think we should run through the schedule one more time,\" said Uncle Vernon. \"We should all be in position at eight o\\'clock. Petunia, you will be - ?\" \"In the lounge,\" said Aunt Petunia promptly, \"waiting to welcome them graciously to our home.\" \"Good, good. And Dudley?\" \"I\\'ll be waiting to open the door.\" Dudley put on a foul, simpering smile. \"May I take your coats, Mr. and Mrs. Mason?\" \"They\\'ll love him!\" cried Aunt Petunia rapturously. \"Excellent, Dudley,\" said Uncle Vernon. Then he rounded on Harry. \"And you?\" \"I\\'ll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending I\\'m not there,\" said Harry tonelessly. \"Exactly,\" said Uncle Vernon nastily. \"I will lead them into the lounge, introduce you, Petunia, and pour them drinks. At eight-fifteen - \" \"I\\'ll announce dinner,\" said Aunt Petunia. \"And, Dudley, you\\'ll say - \" \"May I take you through to the dining room, Mrs. Mason?\" said Dudley, offering his fat arm to an invisible woman. \"My perfect little gentleman!\" sniffed Aunt Petunia. \"And you?\" said Uncle Vernon viciously to Harry. \"I\\'ll be in my room, making no noise and pretending I\\'m not there,\" said Harry dully. \"Precisely. Now, we should aim to get in a few good compliments at dinner. Petunia, any ideas?\" \"Vernon tells me you\\'re a wonderful golfer, Mr. Mason– Do tell me where you bought your dress, Mrs. Mason–\" \"Perfect– Dudley?\" \"How about - ‚We had to write an essay about our hero at school, Mr. Mason, and I wrote about you.\\'\" This was too much for both Aunt Petunia and Harry. Aunt Petunia burst into tears and hugged her son, while Harry ducked under the table so they wouldn\\'t see him laughing. \"And you, boy?\" Harry fought to keep his face straight as he emerged. \"I\\'ll be in my room, making no noise and pretending I\\'m not there,\" he said. \"Too right, you will.\" said Uncle Vernon forcefully. \"The Masons don\\'t know anything about you and it\\'s going to stay that way. When dinner\\'s over, you take Mrs. Mason back to the lounge for coffee, Petunia, and I\\'ll bring the subject around to drills. With any luck, I\\'ll have the deal signed and sealed before the news at ten. Be shopping for a vacation home in Majorca this time tomorrow.\" Harry couldn\\'t feel too excited about this. He didn\\'t think the Dursleys would like him any better in Majorca than they did on Privet Drive. \"Right - I\\'m off into town to pick up the dinner jackets for Dudley and me. And you,\" he snarled at Harry. \"You stay out of your aunt\\'s way while she\\'s cleaning.\" Harry left through the back door. It was a brilliant, sunny day. He crossed the lawn, slumped down on the garden bench, and sang under his breath: \"Happy birthday to me– happy birthday to me–\" No cards, no presents, and he would be spending the evening pretending not to exist. He gazed miserably into the hedge. He had never felt so lonely. More than anything else at Hogwarts, more even than playing Quidditch, Harry missed his best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. They, however, didn\\'t seem to be missing him at all. Neither of them had written to him all summer, even though Ron had said he was going to ask Harry to come and stay. Countless times, Harry had been on the point of unlocking Hedwig\\'s cage by magic and sending her to Ron and Hermione with a letter, but it wasn\\'t worth the risk. Underage wizards weren\\'t allowed to use magic outside of school. Harry hadn\\'t told the Dursleys this; he knew it was only their terror that he might turn them all into dung beetles that stopped them from locking him in the cupboard under the stairs with his wand and broomstick. For the first couple of weeks back, Harry had enjoyed muttering nonsense words under his breath and watching Dudley tearing out of the room as fast as his fat legs would carry him. But the long silence from Ron and Hermione had made Harry feel so cut off from the magical world that even taunting Dudley had lost its appeal - and now Ron and Hermione had forgotten his birthday. What wouldn\\'t he give now for a message from Hogwarts? From any witch or wizard? He\\'d almost be glad of a sight of his archenemy, Draco Malfoy, just to be sure it hadn\\'t all been a dream– Not that his whole year at Hogwarts had been fun. At the very end of last term, Harry had come face-to-face with none other than Lord Voldemort himself. Voldemort might be a ruin of his former self, but he was still terrifying, still cunning, still determined to regain power. Harry had slipped through Voldemort\\'s clutches for a second time, but it had been a narrow escape, and even now, weeks later, Harry kept waking in the night, drenched in cold sweat, wondering where Voldemort was now, remembering his livid face, his wide, mad eyes - Harry suddenly sat bolt upright on the garden bench. He had been staring absent-mindedly into the hedge - and the hedge was staring back. Two enormous green eyes had appeared among the leaves. Harry jumped to his feet just as a jeering voice floated across the lawn. \"I know what day it is,\" sang Dudley, waddling toward him. The huge eyes blinked and vanished. \"What?\" said Harry, not taking his eyes off the spot where they had been. \"I know what day it is,\" Dudley repeated, coming right up to him. \"Well done,\" said Harry. \"So you\\'ve finally learned the days of the week.\" \"Today\\'s your birthday,\" sneered Dudley. \"How come you haven\\'t got any cards? Haven\\'t you even got friends at that freak place?\" \"Better not let your mum hear you talking about my school,\" said Harry coolly. Dudley hitched up his trousers, which were slipping down his fat bottom. \"Why\\'re you staring at the hedge?\" he said suspiciously. \"I\\'m trying to decide what would be the best spell to set it on fire,\" said Harry. Dudley stumbled backward at once, a look of panic on his fat face. \"You c-can\\'t - Dad told you you\\'re not to do m-magic - he said he\\'ll chuck you out of the house - and you haven\\'t got anywhere else to go - you haven\\'t got any friends to take you - \" \"Jiggery pokery!\" said Harry in a fierce voice. \"Hocus pocus - squiggly wiggly - \" \"MUUUUUUM!\" howled Dudley, tripping over his feet as he dashed back toward the house. \"MUUUUM! He\\'s doing you know what!\" Harry paid dearly for his moment of fun. As neither Dudley nor the hedge was in any way hurt, Aunt Petunia knew he hadn\\'t really done magic, but he still had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his head with the soapy frying pan. Then she gave him work to do, with the promise he wouldn\\'t eat again until he\\'d finished. While Dudley lolled around watching and eating ice cream, Harry cleaned the windows, washed the car, mowed the lawn, trimmed the flowerbeds, pruned and watered the roses, and repainted the garden bench. The sun blazed overhead, burning the back of his neck. Harry knew he shouldn\\'t have risen to Dudley\\'s bait, but Dudley had said the very thing Harry had been thinking himself– maybe he didn\\'t have any friends at Hogwarts– Wish they could see famous Harry Potter now, he thought savagely as he spread manure on the flower beds, his back aching, sweat running down his face. It was half past seven in the evening when at last, exhausted, he heard Aunt Petunia calling him. \"Get in here! And walk on the newspaper!\" Harry moved gladly into the shade of the gleaming kitchen. On top of the fridge stood tonight\\'s pudding: a huge mound of whipped cream and sugared violets. A loin of roast pork was sizzling in the oven. \"Eat quickly! The Masons will be here soon!\" snapped Aunt Petunia, pointing to two slices of bread and a lump of cheese on the kitchen table. She was already wearing a salmon-pink cocktail dress. Harry washed his hands and bolted down his pitiful supper. The moment he had finished, Aunt Petunia whisked away his plate. \"Upstairs! Hurry!\" As he passed the door to the living room, Harry caught a glimpse of Uncle Vernon and Dudley in bow ties and dinner jackets. He had only just reached the upstairs landing when the door bell rang and Uncle Vernon\\'s furious face appeared at the foot of the stairs. \"Remember, boy - one sound - \" Harry crossed to his bedroom on tiptoe slipped inside, closed the door, and turned to collapse on his bed. The trouble was, there was already someone sitting on it. CHAPTER TWO Dobby\\'s Warning Harry managed not to shout out, but it was a close thing. The little creature on the bed had large, bat-like ears and bulging green eyes the size of tennis balls. Harry knew instantly that this was what had been watching him out of the garden hedge that morning. As they stared at each other, Harry heard Dudley\\'s voice from the hall. \"May I take your coats, Mr. and Mrs. Mason?\" The creature slipped off the bed and bowed so low that the end of its long, thin nose touched the carpet. Harry noticed that it was wearing what looked like an old pillowcase, with rips for arm- and leg-holes. \"Er - hello,\" said Harry nervously. \"Harry Potter!\" said the creature in a high-pitched voice Harry was sure would carry down the stairs. \"So long has Dobby wanted to meet you, sir– Such an honor it is–\" \"Th-thank you,\" said Harry, edging along the wall and sinking into his desk chair, next to Hedwig, who was asleep in her large cage. He wanted to ask, \"What are you?\" but thought it would sound too rude, so instead he said, \"Who are you?\" \"Dobby, sir. Just Dobby. Dobby the house-elf,\" said the creature. \"Oh - really?\" said Harry. \"Er - I don\\'t want to be rude or anything, but - this isn\\'t a great time for me to have a house-elf in my bedroom.\" Aunt Petunias high, false laugh sounded from the living room. The elf hung his head. \"Not that I\\'m not pleased to meet you,\" said Harry quickly, \"but, er, is there any particular reason you\\'re here?\" \"Oh, yes, sir,\" said Dobby earnestly. \"Dobby has come to tell you, sir– it is difficult, sir– Dobby wonders where to begin–\" \"Sit down,\" said Harry politely, pointing at the bed. To his horror, the elf burst into tears - very noisy tears. \"S-sit down!\" he wailed. \"Never– never ever–\" Harry thought he heard the voices downstairs falter. \"I\\'m sorry,\" he whispered, \"I didn\\'t mean to offend you or anything - \" \"Offend Dobby!\" choked the elf. \"Dobby has never been asked to sit down by a wizard - like an equal - \" Harry, trying to say \"Shh!\" and look comforting at the same time, ushered Dobby back onto the bed where he sat hiccoughing, looking like a large and very ugly doll. At last he managed to control himself, and sat with his great eyes fixed on Harry in an expression of watery adoration. \"You can\\'t have met many decent wizards,\" said Harry, trying to cheer him up. Dobby shook his head. Then, without warning, he leapt up and started banging his head furiously on the window, shouting, \"Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby!\" \"Don\\'t - what are you doing?\" Harry hissed, springing up and pulling Dobby back onto the bed - Hedwig had woken up with a particularly loud screech and was beating her wings wildly against the bars of her cage. \"Dobby had to punish himself, sir,\" said the elf, who had gone slightly cross-eyed. \"Dobby almost spoke ill of his family, sir–\" \"Your family?\" \"The wizard family Dobby serves, sir– Dobby is a house-elf - bound to serve one house and one family forever–\" \"Do they know you\\'re here?\" asked Harry curiously. Dobby shuddered. \"Oh, no, sir, no– Dobby will have to punish himself most grievously for coming to see you, sir. Dobby will have to shut his ears in the oven door for this. If they ever knew, sir - \" \"But won\\'t they notice if you shut your ears in the oven door?\" \"Dobby doubts it, sir. Dobby is always having to punish himself for something, sir. They lets Dobby get on with it, sir. Sometimes they reminds me to do extra punishments–\" \"But why don\\'t you leave? Escape?\" \"A house-elf must be set free, sir. And the family will never set Dobby free– Dobby will serve the family until he dies, sir–\" Harry stared. \"And I thought I had it bad staying here for another four weeks,\" he said. \"This makes the Dursleys sound almost human. Can\\'t anyone help you? Can\\'t I?\" Almost at once, Harry wished he hadn\\'t spoken. Dobby dissolved again into wails of gratitude. \"Please,\" Harry whispered frantically, \"please be quiet. If the Dursleys hear anything, if they know you\\'re here - \" \"Harry Potter asks if he can help Dobby– Dobby has heard of your greatness, sir, but of your goodness, Dobby never knew–\" Harry, who was feeling distinctly hot in the face, said, \"Whatever you\\'ve heard about my greatness is a load of rubbish. I\\'m not even top of my year at Hogwarts; that\\'s Hermione, she - \" But he stopped quickly, because thinking about Hermione was painful. \"Harry Potter is humble and modest,\" said Dobby reverently, his orb-like eyes aglow. \"Harry Potter speaks not of his triumph over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named - \" \"Voldemort?\" said Harry. Dobby clapped his hands over his bat ears and moaned, \"Ah, speak not the name, sir! Speak not the name!\" \"Sorry,\" said Harry quickly. \"I know lots of people don\\'t like it. My friend Ron - \" He stopped again. Thinking about Ron was painful, too. Dobby leaned toward Harry, his eyes wide as headlights. \"Dobby heard tell,\" he said hoarsely, \"that Harry Potter met the Dark Lord for a second time just weeks ago– that Harry Potter escaped yet again.\" Harry nodded and Dobby\\'s eyes suddenly shone with tears. \"Ah, sir,\" he gasped, dabbing his face with a corner of the grubby pillowcase he was wearing. \"Harry Potter is valiant and bold! He has braved so many dangers already! But Dobby has come to protect Harry Potter, to warn him, even if he does have to shut his ears in the oven door later– Harry Potter must not go back to Hogwarts.\" There was a silence broken only by the chink of knives and forks from downstairs and the distant rumble of Uncle Vernon\\'s voice. \"W-what?\" Harry stammered. \"But I\\'ve got to go back - term starts on September first. It\\'s all that\\'s keeping me going. You don\\'t know what it\\'s like here. I don\\'t belong here. I belong in your world - at Hogwarts.\" \"No, no, no,\" squeaked Dobby, shaking his head so hard his ears flapped. \"Harry Potter must stay where he is safe. He is too great, too good, to lose. If Harry Potter goes back to Hogwarts, he will be in mortal danger.\" \"Why?\" said Harry in surprise. \"There is a plot, Harry Potter. A plot to make most terrible things happen at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year,\" whispered Dobby, suddenly trembling all over. \"Dobby has known it for months, sir. Harry Potter must not put himself in peril. He is too important, sir!\" \"What terrible things?\" said Harry at once. \"Who\\'s plotting them?\" Dobby made a funny choking noise and then banged his head frantically against the wall. \"All right!\" cried Harry, grabbing the elf\\'s arm to stop him. \"You can\\'t tell me. I understand. But why are you warning me?\" A sudden, unpleasant thought struck him. \"Hang on - this hasn\\'t got anything to do with Vol - sorry - with You-Know-Who, has it? You could just shake or nod,\" he added hastily as Dobby\\'s head tilted worryingly close to the wall again. Slowly, Dobby shook his head. \"Not - not He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, sir - \" But Dobby\\'s eyes were wide and he seemed to be trying to give Harry a hint. Harry, however, was completely lost. \"He hasn\\'t got a brother, has he?\" Dobby shook his head, his eyes wider than ever. \"Well then, I can\\'t think who else would have a chance of making horrible things happen at Hogwarts,\" said Harry. \"I mean, there\\'s Dumbledore, for one thing - you know who Dumbledore is, don\\'t you?\" Dobby bowed his head. \"Albus Dumbledore is the greatest headmaster Hogwarts has ever had. Dobby knows it, sir. Dobby has heard Dumbledore\\'s powers rival those of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named at the height of his strength. But, sir\" - Dobby\\'s voice dropped to an urgent whisper - \"there are powers Dumbledore doesn\\'t– powers no decent wizard–\" And before Harry could stop him, Dobby bounded off the bed, seized Harry\\'s desk lamp, and started beating himself around the head with earsplitting yelps. A sudden silence fell downstairs. Two seconds later Harry, heart thudding madly, heard Uncle Vernon coming into the hall, calling, \"Dudley must have left his television on again, the little tyke!\" \"Quick! In the closet!\" hissed Harry, stuffing Dobby in, shutting the door, and flinging himself onto the bed just as the door handle turned. \"What - the - devil - are - you - doing?\" said Uncle Vernon through gritted teeth, his face horribly close to Harry\\'s. \"You\\'ve just ruined the punch line of my Japanese golfer joke– One more sound and you\\'ll wish you\\'d never been born, boy!\" He stomped flat-footed from the room. Shaking, Harry let Dobby out of the closet. \"See what it\\'s like here?\" he said. \"See why I\\'ve got to go back to Hogwarts? It\\'s the only place I\\'ve got - well, I think I\\'ve got friends.\" \"Friends who don\\'t even write to Harry Potter?\" said Dobby slyly. \"I expect they\\'ve just been - wait a minute,\" said Harry, frowning. \"How do you know my friends haven\\'t been writing to me?\" Dobby shuffled his feet. \"Harry Potter mustn\\'t be angry with Dobby. Dobby did it for the best - \" \"Have you been stopping my letters?\" \"Dobby has them here, sir,\" said the elf. Stepping nimbly out of Harry\\'s reach, he pulled a thick wad of envelopes from the inside of the pillowcase he was wearing. Harry could make out Hermione\\'s neat writing, Ron\\'s untidy scrawl, and even a scribble that looked as though it was from the Hogwarts gamekeeper, Hagrid. Dobby blinked anxiously up at Harry. \"Harry Potter mustn\\'t be angry– Dobby hoped– if Harry Potter thought his friends had forgotten him– Harry Potter might not want to go back to school, sir–\" Harry wasn\\'t listening. He made a grab for the letters, but Dobby jumped out of reach. \"Harry Potter will have them, sir, if he gives Dobby his word that he will not return to Hogwarts. Ah, sir, this is a danger you must not face! Say you won\\'t go back, sir!\" \"No,\" said Harry angrily. \"Give me my friends\\' letters!\" \"Then Harry Potter leaves Dobby no choice,\" said the elf sadly. Before Harry could move, Dobby had darted to the bedroom door, pulled it open, and sprinted down the stairs. Mouth dry, stomach lurching, Harry sprang after him, trying not to make a sound. He jumped the last six steps, landing catlike on the hall carpet, looking around for Dobby. From the dining room he heard Uncle Vernon saying, \"– tell Petunia that very funny story about those American plumbers, Mr. Mason. She\\'s been dying to hear–\" Harry ran up the hall into the kitchen and felt his stomach disappear. Aunt Petunia\\'s masterpiece of a pudding, the mountain of cream and sugared violets, was floating up near the ceiling. On top of a cupboard in the corner crouched Dobby. \"No,\" croaked Harry. \"Please– they\\'ll kill me–\" \"Harry Potter must say he\\'s not going back to school - \" \"Dobby– please–\" \"Say it, sir - \" \"I can\\'t - \" Dobby gave him a tragic look. \"Then Dobby must do it, sir, for Harry Potter\\'s own good.\" The pudding fell to the floor with a heart-stopping crash. Cream splattered the windows and walls as the dish shattered. With a crack like a whip, Dobby vanished. There were screams from the dining room and Uncle Vernon burst into the kitchen to find Harry, rigid with shock, covered from head to foot in Aunt Petunia\\'s pudding. At first, it looked as though Uncle Vernon would manage to gloss the whole thing over. (\"Just our nephew - very disturbed - meeting strangers upsets him, so we kept him upstairs–\") He shooed the shocked Masons back into the dining room, promised Harry he would flay him to within an inch of his life when the Masons had left, and handed him a mop. Aunt Petunia dug some ice cream out of the freezer and Harry, still shaking, started scrubbing the kitchen clean. Uncle Vernon might still have been able to make his deal - if it hadn\\'t been for the owl. Aunt Petunia was just passing around a box of after-dinner mints when a huge barn owl swooped through the dining room window, dropped a letter on Mrs. Mason\\'s head, and swooped out again. Mrs. Mason screamed like a banshee and ran from the house shouting about lunatics. Mr. Mason stayed just long enough to tell the Dursleys that his wife was mortally afraid of birds of all shapes and sizes, and to ask whether this was their idea of a joke. Harry stood in the kitchen, clutching the mop for support, as Uncle Vernon advanced on him, a demonic glint in his tiny eyes. \"Read it!\" he hissed evilly, brandishing the letter the owl had delivered. \"Go on - read it!\" Harry took it. It did not contain birthday greetings. Dear Mr. Potter, We have received intelligence that a Hover Charm was used at your place of residence this evening at twelve minutes past nine. As you know, underage wizards are not permitted to perform spells outside school, and further spellwork on your part may lead to expulsion from said school. (Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery, 1875, Paragraph C). We would also ask you to remember that any magical activity that risks notice by members of the non magical community (Muggles) is a serious offense under section 13 of the International Confederation of Warlocks\\' Statute of Secrecy. Enjoy your holidays! Yours sincerely, Mafalda Hopkirk IMPROPER USE OF MAGIC OFFICE Ministry of Magic Harry looked up from the letter and gulped. \"You didn\\'t tell us you weren\\'t allowed to use magic outside school,\" said Uncle Vernon, a mad gleam dancing in his eyes. \"Forgot to mention it– Slipped your mind, I daresay–\" He was bearing down on Harry like a great bulldog, all his teeth bared. \"Well, I\\'ve got news for you, boy– I\\'m locking you up– You\\'re never going back to that school– never– and if you try and magic yourself out - they\\'ll expel you!\" And laughing like a maniac, he dragged Harry back upstairs. Uncle Vernon was as bad as his word. The following morning, he paid a man to fit bars on Harry\\'s window. He himself fitted a cat-flap in the bedroom door, so that small amounts of food could be pushed inside three times a day. They let Harry out to use the bathroom morning and evening. Otherwise, he was locked in his room around the clock. Three days later, the Dursleys were showing no sign of relenting, and Harry couldn\\'t see any way out of his situation. He lay on his bed watching the sun sinking behind the bars on the window and wondered miserably what was going to happen to him. What was the good of magicking himself out of his room if Hogwarts would expel him for doing it? Yet life at Privet Drive had reached an all-time low. Now that the Dursleys knew they weren\\'t going to wake up as fruit bats, he had lost his only weapon. Dobby might have saved Harry from horrible happenings at Hogwarts, but the way things were going, he\\'d probably starve to death anyway. The cat-flap rattled and Aunt Petunias hand appeared, pushing a bowl of canned soup into the room. Harry, whose insides were aching with hunger, jumped off his bed and seized it. The soup was stone-cold, but he drank half of it in one gulp. Then he crossed the room to Hedwig\\'s cage and tipped the soggy vegetables at the bottom of the bowl into her empty food tray. She ruffled her feathers and gave him a look of deep disgust. \"It\\'s no good turning your beak up at it - that\\'s all we\\'ve got,\" said Harry grimly. He put the empty bowl back on the floor next to the cat-flap and lay back down on the bed, somehow even hungrier than he had been before the soup. Supposing he was still alive in another four weeks, what would happen if he didn\\'t turn up at Hogwarts? Would someone be sent to see why he hadn\\'t come back? Would they be able to make the Dursleys let him go? The room was growing dark. Exhausted, stomach rumbling, mind spinning over the same unanswerable questions, Harry fell into an uneasy sleep. He dreamed that he was on show in a zoo, with a card reading UNDERAGE WIZARD attached to his cage. People goggled through the bars at him as he lay, starving and weak, on a bed of straw. He saw Dobby\\'s face in the crowd and shouted out, asking for help, but Dobby called, \"Harry Potter is safe there, sir!\" and vanished. Then the Dursleys appeared and Dudley rattled the bars of the cage, laughing at him. \"Stop it,\" Harry muttered as the rattling pounded in his sore head. \"Leave me alone– cut it out– I\\'m trying to sleep–\" He opened his eyes. Moonlight was shining through the bars on the window. And someone was goggling through the bars at him: a freckle-faced, red-haired, long-nosed someone. Ron Weasley was outside Harry\\'s window. CHAPTER THREE The Burrow \"Ron.\" breathed Harry, creeping to the window and pushing it up so they could talk through the bars. \"Ron, how did you - ? What the - ?\" Harry\\'s mouth fell open as the full impact of what he was seeing hit him. Ron was leaning out of the back window of an old turquoise car, which was parked in midair. Grinning at Harry from the front seats were Fred and George, Ron\\'s elder twin brothers. \"All right, Harry?\" asked George. \"What\\'s been going on?\" said Ron. \"Why haven\\'t you been answering my letters? I\\'ve asked you to stay about twelve times, and then Dad came home and said you\\'d got an official warning for using magic in front of Muggles - \" \"It wasn\\'t me - and how did he know?\" \"He works for the Ministry,\" said Ron. \"You know we\\'re not supposed to do spells outside school - \" \"You should talk,\" said Harry, staring at the floating car. \"Oh, this doesn\\'t count,\" said Ron. \"We\\'re only borrowing this. It\\'s Dad\\'s, we didn\\'t enchant it. But doing magic in front of those Muggles you live with - \" \"I told you, I didn\\'t - but it\\'ll take too long to explain now - look, can you tell them at Hogwarts that the Dursleys have locked me up and won\\'t let me come back, and obviously I can\\'t magic myself out, because the Ministry\\'ll think that\\'s the second spell I\\'ve done in three days, so - \" \"Stop gibbering,\" said Ron. \"We\\'ve come to take you home with us.\" \"But you can\\'t magic me out either - \" \"We don\\'t need to,\" said Ron, jerking his head toward the front seat and grinning. \"You forget who I\\'ve got with me.\" \"Tie that around the bars,\" said Fred, throwing the end of a rope to Harry. \"If the Dursleys wake up, I\\'m dead,\" said Harry as he tied the rope tightly around a bar and Fred revved up the car. \"Don\\'t worry,\" said Fred, \"and stand back.\" Harry moved back into the shadows next to Hedwig, who seemed to have realized how important this was and kept still and silent. The car revved louder and louder and suddenly, with a crunching noise, the bars were pulled clean out of the window as Fred drove straight up in the air. Harry ran back to the window to see the bars dangling a few feet above the ground. Panting, Ron hoisted them up into the car. Harry listened anxiously, but there was no sound from the Dursleys\\' bedroom. When the bars were safely in the back seat with Ron, Fred reversed as close as possible to Harry\\'s window. \"Get in,\" Ron said. \"But all my Hogwarts stuff - my wand - my broomstick - \" \"Where is it?\" \"Locked in the cupboard under the stairs, and I can\\'t get out of this room - \" \"No problem,\" said George from the front passenger seat. \"Out of the way, Harry.\" Fred and George climbed catlike through the window into Harry\\'s room. You had to hand it to them, thought Harry, as George took an ordinary hairpin from his pocket and started to pick the lock. \"A lot of wizards think it\\'s a waste of time, knowing this sort of Muggle trick,\" said Fred, \"but we feel they\\'re skills worth learning, even if they are a bit slow.\" There was a small click and the door swung open. \"So - we\\'ll get your trunk - you grab anything you need from your room and hand it out to Ron,\" whispered George. \"Watch out for the bottom stair - it creaks,\" Harry whispered back as the twins disappeared onto the dark landing. Harry dashed around his room, collecting his things and passing them out of the window to Ron. Then he went to help Fred and George heave his trunk up the stairs. Harry heard Uncle Vernon cough. At last, panting, they reached the landing, then carried the trunk through Harry\\'s room to the open window. Fred climbed back into the car to pull with Ron, and Harry and George pushed from the bedroom side. Inch by inch, the trunk slid through the window. Uncle Vernon coughed again. \"A bit more,\" panted Fred, who was pulling from inside the car. \"One good push - \" Harry and George threw their shoulders against the trunk and it slid out of the window into the back seat of the car. \"Okay, let\\'s go,\" George whispered. But as Harry climbed onto the windowsill there came a sudden loud screech from behind him, followed immediately by the thunder of Uncle Vernon\\'s voice. \"THAT RUDDY OWL!\" \"I\\'ve forgotten Hedwig!\" Harry tore back across the room as the landing light clicked on - he snatched up Hedwig\\'s cage, dashed to the window, and passed it out to Ron. He was scrambling back onto the chest of drawers when Uncle Vernon hammered on the unlocked door - and it crashed open. For a split second, Uncle Vernon stood framed in the doorway; then he let out a bellow like an angry bull and dived at Harry, grabbing him by the ankle. Ron, Fred, and George seized Harry\\'s arms and pulled as hard as they could. \"Petunia!\" roared Uncle Vernon. \"He\\'s getting away! HE\\'S GETTING AWAY!\" But the Weasleys gave a gigantic tug and Harry\\'s leg slid out of Uncle Vernon\\'s grasp - Harry was in the car - he\\'d slammed the door shut - \"Put your foot down, Fred!\" yelled Ron, and the car shot suddenly toward the moon. Harry couldn\\'t believe it - he was free. He rolled down the window, the night air whipping his hair, and looked back at the shrinking rooftops of Privet Drive. Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley were all hanging, dumbstruck, out of Harry\\'s window. \"See you next summer!\" Harry yelled. The Weasleys roared with laughter and Harry settled back in his seat, grinning from ear to ear. \"Let Hedwig out,\" he told Ron. \"She can fly behind us. She hasn\\'t had a chance to stretch her wings for ages.\" George handed the hairpin to Ron and, a moment later, Hedwig soared joyfully out of the window to glide alongside them like a ghost. \"So - what\\'s the story, Harry?\" said Ron impatiently. \"What\\'s been happening?\" Harry told them all about Dobby, the warning he\\'d given Harry and the fiasco of the violet pudding. There was a long, shocked silence when he had finished. \"Very fishy,\" said Fred finally. \"Definitely dodgy\" agreed George. \"So he wouldn\\'t even tell you who\\'s supposed to be plotting all this stuff?\" \"I don\\'t think he could,\" said Harry. \"I told you, every time he got close to letting something slip, he started banging his head against the wall.\" He saw Fred and George look at each other. \"What, you think he was lying to me?\" said Harry. \"Well,\" said Fred, \"put it this way - house-elves have got powerful magic of their own, but they can\\'t usually use it without their master\\'s permission. I reckon old Dobby was sent to stop you coming back to Hogwarts. Someone\\'s idea of a joke. Can you think of anyone at school with a grudge against you?\" \"Yes,\" said Harry and Ron together, instantly. \"Draco Malfoy,\" Harry explained. \"He hates me.\" \"Draco Malfoy?\" said George, turning around. \"Not Lucius Malfoy\\'s son?\" \"Must be, it\\'s not a very common name, is it?\" said Harry. \"I\\'ve heard Dad talking about him,\" said George. \"He was a big supporter of You-Know-Who.\" \"And when You-Know-Who disappeared,\" said Fred, craning around to look at Harry, \"Lucius Malfoy came back saying he\\'d never meant any of it. Load of dung - Dad reckons he was right in You- Know-Who\\'s inner circle.\" Harry had heard these rumors about Malfoy\\'s family before, and they didn\\'t surprise him at all. Malfoy made Dudley Dursley look like a kind, thoughtful, and sensitive boy– \"I don\\'t know whether the Malfoys own a house-elf–\" said Harry. \"Well, whoever owns him will be an old wizarding family, and they\\'ll be rich,\" said Fred. \"Yeah, Mum\\'s always wishing we had a house-elf to do the ironing,\" said George. \"But all we\\'ve got is a lousy old ghoul in the attic and gnomes all over the garden. House-elves come with big old manors and castles and places like that; you wouldn\\'t catch one in our house–\" Harry was silent. Judging by the fact that Draco Malfoy usually had the best of everything, his family was rolling in wizard gold; he could just see Malfoy strutting around a large manor house. Sending the family servant to stop Harry from going back to Hogwarts also sounded exactly like the sort of thing Malfoy would do. Had Harry been stupid to take Dobby seriously? \"I\\'m glad we came to get you, anyway,\" said Ron. \"I was getting really worried when you didn\\'t answer any of my letters. I thought it was Errol\\'s fault at first - \" \"Who\\'s Errol?\" \"Our owl. He\\'s ancient. It wouldn\\'t be the first time he\\'d collapsed on a delivery. So then I tried to borrow Hermes - \" \"Who?\" \"The owl Mum and Dad bought Percy when he was made prefect,\" said Fred from the front. \"But Percy wouldn\\'t lend him to me,\" said Ron. \"Said he needed him.\" \"Percy\\'s been acting very oddly this summer,\" said George, frowning. \"And he has been sending a lot of letters and spending a load of time shut up in his room– I mean, there\\'s only so many times you can polish a prefect badge– You\\'re driving too far west, Fred,\" he added, pointing at a compass on the dashboard. Fred twiddled the steering wheel. \"So, does your dad know you\\'ve got the car?\" said Harry, guessing the answer. \"Er, no,\" said Ron, \"he had to work tonight. Hopefully we\\'ll be able to get it back in the garage without Mum noticing we flew it.\" \"What does your dad do at the Ministry of Magic, anyway?\" \"He works in the most boring department,\" said Ron. \"The Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office.\" \"The what?\" \"It\\'s all to do with bewitching things that are Muggle-made, you know, in case they end up back in a Muggle shop or house. Like, last year, some old witch died and her tea set was sold to an antiques shop. This Muggle woman bought it, took it home, and tried to serve her friends tea in it. It was a nightmare - Dad was working overtime for weeks.\" \"What happened?\" \"The teapot went berserk and squirted boiling tea all over the place and one man ended up in the hospital with the sugar tongs clamped to his nose. Dad was going frantic - it\\'s only him and an old warlock called Perkins in the office - and they had to do Memory Charms and all sorts of stuff to cover it up - \" \"But your dad - this car - \" Fred laughed. \"Yeah, Dad\\'s crazy about everything to do with Muggles; our shed\\'s full of Muggle stuff. He takes it apart, puts spells on it, and puts it back together again. If he raided our house he\\'d have to put himself under arrest. It drives Mum mad.\" \"That\\'s the main road,\" said George, peering down through the windshield. \"We\\'ll be there in ten minutes– Just as well, it\\'s getting light–\" A faint pinkish glow was visible along the horizon to the east. Fred brought the car lower, and Harry saw a dark patchwork of fields and clumps of trees. \"We\\'re a little way outside the village,\" said George. \"Ottery St. Catchpole.\" Lower and lower went the flying car. The edge of a brilliant red sun was now gleaming through the trees. \"Touchdown!\" said Fred as, with a slight bump, they hit the ground. They had landed next to a tumbledown garage in a small yard, and Harry looked out for the first time at Ron\\'s house. It looked as though it had once been a large stone pigpen, but extra rooms had been added here and there until it was several stories high and so crooked it looked as though it were held up by magic (which Harry reminded himself, it probably was). Four or five chimneys were perched on top of the red roof. A lopsided sign stuck in the ground near the entrance read, THE BURROW. Around the front door lay a jumble of rubber boots and a very rusty cauldron. Several fat brown chickens were pecking their way around the yard. \"It\\'s not much,\" said Ron. \"It\\'s wonderful,\" said Harry happily, thinking of Privet Drive. They got out of the car. \"Now, we\\'ll go upstairs really quietly,\" said Fred, \"and wait for Mum to call us for breakfast Then, Ron, you come bounding downstairs going, ‚Mum, look who turned up in the night!\\' and she\\'ll be all pleased to see Harry and no one need ever know we flew the car.\" \"Right,\" said Ron. \"Come on, Harry, I sleep at the - at the top - \" Ron had gone a nasty greenish color, his eyes fixed on the house. The other three wheeled around. Mrs. Weasley was marching across the yard, scattering chickens, and for a short, plump, kind-faced woman, it was remarkable how much she looked like a saber-toothed tiger. \"Ah, \"said Fred. \"Oh, dear,\" said George. Mrs. Weasley came to a halt in front of them, her hands on her hips, staring from one guilty face to the next. She was wearing a flowered apron with a wand sticking out of the pocket. \"So,\" she said. \"Morning, Mum,\" said George, in what he clearly thought was a jaunty, winning voice. \"Have you any idea how worried I\\'ve been?\" said Mrs. Weasley in a deadly whisper. \"Sorry, Mum, but see, we had to - \" All three of Mrs. Weasley\\'s sons were taller than she was, but they cowered as her rage broke over them. \"Beds empty! No note! Car gone - could have crashed - out of my mind with worry - did you care? - never, as long as I\\'ve lived - you wait until your father gets home, we never had trouble like this from Bill or Charlie or Percy - \" \"Perfect Percy,\" muttered Fred. \"YOU COULD DO WITH TAKING A LEAF OUT OF PERCY\\'S BOOK!\" yelled Mrs. Weasley, prodding a finger in Fred\\'s chest. \"You could have died, you could have been seen, you could have lost your father his job - \" It seemed to go on for hours. Mrs. Weasley had shouted herself hoarse before she turned on Harry, who backed away. \"I\\'m very pleased to see you, Harry, dear,\" she said. \"Come in and have some breakfast.\" She turned and walked back into the house and Harry, after a nervous glance at Ron, who nodded encouragingly, followed her. The kitchen was small and rather cramped. There was a scrubbed wooden table and chairs in the middle, and Harry sat down on the edge of his seat, looking around. He had never been in a wizard house before. The clock on the wall opposite him had only one hand and no numbers at all. Written around the edge were things like Time to make tea, Time to feed the chickens, and You\\'re late. Books were stacked three deep on the mantelpiece, books with titles like Charm Your Own Cheese, Enchantment in Baking, and One Minute Feasts - It\\'s Magic! And unless Harry\\'s ears were deceiving him, the old radio next to the sink had just announced that coming up was \"Witching Hour, with the popular singing sorceress, Celestina Warbeck.\" Mrs. Weasley was clattering around, cooking breakfast a little haphazardly, throwing dirty looks at her sons as she threw sausages into the frying pan. Every now and then she muttered things like \"don\\'t know what you were thinking of,\" and \"never would have believed it.\" \"I don\\'t blame you, dear,\" she assured Harry, tipping eight or nine sausages onto his plate. \"Arthur and I have been worried about you, too. Just last night we were saying we\\'d come and get you ourselves if you hadn\\'t written back to Ron by Friday. But really,\" (she was now adding three fried eggs to his plate) \"flying an illegal car halfway across the country - anyone could have seen you - \" She flicked her wand casually at the dishes in the sink, which began to clean themselves, clinking gently in the background. \"It was cloudy, Mum!\" said Fred. \"You keep your mouth closed while you\\'re eating!\" Mrs. Weasley snapped. \"They were starving him, Mum!\" said George. \"And you!\" said Mrs. Weasley, but it was with a slightly softened expression that she started cutting Harry bread and buttering it for him. At that moment there was a diversion in the form of a small, redheaded figure in a long nightdress, who appeared in the kitchen, gave a small squeal, and ran out again. \"Ginny,\" said Ron in an undertone to Harry. \"My sister. She\\'s been talking about you all summer.\" \"Yeah, she\\'ll be wanting your autograph, Harry,\" Fred said with a grin, but he caught his mother\\'s eye and bent his face over his plate without another word. Nothing more was said until all four plates were clean, which took a surprisingly short time. \"Blimey, I\\'m tired,\" yawned Fred, setting down his knife and fork at last. \"I think I\\'ll go to bed and - \" \"You will not,\" snapped Mrs. Weasley. \"It\\'s your own fault you\\'ve been up all night. You\\'re going to de-gnome the garden for me; they\\'re getting completely out of hand again - \" \"Oh, Mum - \" \"And you two,\" she said, glaring at Ron and Fred. \"You can go up to bed, dear,\" she added to Harry. \"You didn\\'t ask them to fly that wretched car - \" But Harry, who felt wide awake, said quickly, \"I\\'ll help Ron. I\\'ve never seen a de-gnoming - \" \"That\\'s very sweet of you, dear, but it\\'s dull work,\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"Now, let\\'s see what Lockhart\\'s got to say on the subject - \" And she pulled a heavy book from the stack on the mantelpiece. George groaned. \"Mum, we know how to de-gnome a garden - \" Harry looked at the cover of Mrs. Weasley\\'s book. Written across it in fancy gold letters were the words Gilderoy Lockhart\\'s Guide to Household Pests. There was a big photograph on the front of a very good-looking wizard with wavy blond hair and bright blue eyes. As always in the wizarding world, the photograph was moving; the wizard, who Harry supposed was Gilderoy Lockhart, kept winking cheekily up at them all. Mrs. Weasley beamed down at him. \"Oh, he is marvelous,\" she said. \"He knows his household pests, all right, it\\'s a wonderful book–\" \"Mum fancies him,\" said Fred, in a very audible whisper. \"Don\\'t be so ridiculous, Fred,\" said Mrs. Weasley, her cheeks rather pink. \"All right, if you think you know better than Lockhart, you can go and get on with it, and woe betide you if there\\'s a single gnome in that garden when I come out to inspect it.\" Yawning and grumbling, the Weasleys slouched outside with Harry behind them. The garden was large, and in Harry\\'s eyes, exactly what a garden should be. The Dursleys wouldn\\'t have liked it - there were plenty of weeds, and the grass needed cutting - but there were gnarled trees all around the walls, plants Harry had never seen spilling from every flower bed, and a big green pond full of frogs. \"Muggles have garden gnomes, too, you know,\" Harry told Ron they crossed the lawn. \"Yeah, I\\'ve seen those things they think are gnomes,\" said Ron, bent double with his head in a peony bush, \"like fat little Santa Clauses with fishing rods–\" There was a violent scuffling noise, the peony bush shuddered, and Ron straightened up. \"This is a gnome,\" he said grimly. \"Gerroff me! Gerroff me!\" squealed the gnome. It was certainly nothing like Santa Claus. It was small and leathery looking, with a large, knobby, bald head exactly like a potato. Ron held it at arm\\'s length as it kicked out at him with its horny little feet; he grasped it around the ankles and turned it upside down. \"This is what you have to do,\" he said. He raised the gnome above his head (\"Gerroff me!\") and started to swing it in great circles like a lasso. Seeing the shocked look on Harry\\'s face, Ron added, \"It doesn\\'t hurt them - you\\'ve just got to make them really dizzy so they can\\'t find their way back to the gnome holes.\" He let go of the gnome\\'s ankles: It flew twenty feet into the air and landed with a thud in the field over the hedge. \"Pitiful,\" said Fred. \"I bet I can get mine beyond that stump.\" Harry learned quickly not to feel too sorry for the gnomes. He decided just to drop the first one he caught over the hedge, but the gnome, sensing weakness, sank its razor-sharp teeth into Harry\\'s finger and he had a hard job shaking it off - until - \"Wow, Harry - that must\\'ve been fifty feet–\" The air was soon thick with flying gnomes. \"See, they\\'re not too bright,\" said George, seizing five or six gnomes at once. \"The moment they know the de-gnoming\\'s going on they storm up to have a look. You\\'d think they\\'d have learned by now just to stay put.\" Soon, the crowd of gnomes in the field started walking away in a straggling line, their little shoulders hunched. \"They\\'ll be back,\" said Ron as they watched the gnomes disappear into the hedge on the other side of the field. \"They love it here– Dad\\'s too soft with them; he thinks they\\'re funny–\" Just then, the front door slammed. \"He\\'s back!\" said George. \"Dad\\'s home!\" They hurried through the garden and back into the house. Mr. Weasley was slumped in a kitchen chair with his glasses off and his eyes closed. He was a thin man, going bald, but the little hair he had was as red as any of his children\\'s. He was wearing long green robes, which were dusty and travel-worn. \"What a night,\" he mumbled, groping for the teapot as they all sat down around him. \"Nine raids. Nine! And old Mundungus Fletcher tried to put a hex on me when I had my back turned–\" Mr. Weasley took a long gulp of tea and sighed. \"Find anything, Dad?\" said Fred eagerly. \"All I got were a few shrinking door keys and a biting kettle,\" yawned Mr. Weasley. \"There was some pretty nasty stuff that wasn\\'t my department, though. Mortlake was taken away for questioning about some extremely odd ferrets, but that\\'s the Committee on Experimental Charms, thank goodness–\" \"Why would anyone bother making door keys shrink?\" said George. \"Just Muggle-baiting,\" sighed Mr. Weasley. \"Sell them a key that keeps shrinking to nothing so they can never find it when they need it.. Of course, it\\'s very hard to convict anyone because no Muggle would admit their key keeps shrinking - they\\'ll insist they just keep losing it. Bless them, they\\'ll go to any lengths to ignore magic, even if it\\'s staring them in the face– But the things our lot have taken to enchanting, you wouldn\\'t believe - \" \"LIKE CARS, FOR INSTANCE?\" Mrs. Weasley had appeared, holding a long poker like a sword. Mr. Weasley\\'s eyes jerked open. He stared guiltily at his wife. \"C-cars, Molly, dear?\" \"Yes, Arthur, cars,\" said Mrs. Weasley, her eyes flashing. \"Imagine a wizard buying a rusty old car and telling his wife all he wanted to do with it was take it apart to see how it worked, while really he was enchanting it to make it fly.\" Mr. Weasley blinked. \"Well, dear, I think you\\'ll find that he would be quite within the law to do that, even if - er - he maybe would have done better to, um, tell his wife the truth– There\\'s a loophole in the law, you\\'ll find– As long as he wasn\\'t intending to fly the car, the fact that the car could fly wouldn\\'t - \" \"Arthur Weasley, you made sure there was a loophole when you wrote that law!\" shouted Mrs. Weasley. \"Just so you could carry on tinkering with all that Muggle rubbish in your shed! And for your information, Harry arrived this morning in the car you weren\\'t intending to fly!\" \"Harry?\" said Mr. Weasley blankly. \"Harry who?\" He looked around, saw Harry, and jumped. \"Good lord, is it Harry Potter? Very pleased to meet you, Ron\\'s told us so much about - \" \"Your sons flew that car to Harry\\'s house and back last night!\" shouted Mrs. Weasley. \"What have you got to say about that, eh?\" \"Did you really?\" said Mr. Weasley eagerly. \"Did it go all right? I - I mean,\" he faltered as sparks flew from Mrs. Weasley\\'s eyes, \"that - that was very wrong, boys - very wrong indeed–\" \"Let\\'s leave them to it,\" Ron muttered to Harry as Mrs. Weasley swelled like a bullfrog. \"Come on, I\\'ll show you my bedroom.\" They slipped out of the kitchen and down a narrow passageway to an uneven staircase, which wound its way, zigzagging up through the house. On the third landing, a door stood ajar. Harry just caught sight of a pair of bright brown eyes staring at him before it closed with a snap. \"Ginny,\" said Ron. \"You don\\'t know how weird it is for her to be this shy. She never shuts up normally - \" They climbed two more flights until they reached a door with peeling paint and a small plaque on it, saying RONALD\\'S ROOM. Harry stepped in, his head almost touching the sloping ceiling, and blinked. It was like walking into a furnace: Nearly everything in Ron\\'s room seemed to be a violent shade of orange: the bedspread, the walls, even the ceiling. Then Harry realized that Ron had covered nearly every inch of the shabby wallpaper with posters of the same seven witches and wizards, all wearing bright orange robes, carrying broomsticks, and waving energetically. \"Your Quidditch team?\" said Harry. \"The Chudley Cannons,\" said Ron, pointing at the orange bedspread, which was emblazoned with two giant black C\\'s and a speeding cannonball. \"Ninth in the league.\" Ron\\'s school spellbooks were stacked untidily in a corner, next to a pile of comics that all seemed to feature The Adventures of Martin Miggs, the Mad Muggle. Ron\\'s magic wand was lying on top of a fish tank full of frog spawn on the windowsill, next to his fat gray rat, Scabbers, who was snoozing in a patch of sun. Harry stepped over a pack of Self-Shuffling playing cards on the floor and looked out of the tiny window. In the field far below he could see a gang of gnomes sneaking one by one back through the Weasleys\\' hedge. Then he turned to look at Ron, who was watching him almost nervously, as though waiting for his opinion. \"It\\'s a bit small,\" said Ron quickly. \"Not like that room you had with the Muggles. And I\\'m right underneath the ghoul in the attic; he\\'s always banging on the pipes and groaning–\" But Harry, grinning widely, said, \"This is the best house I\\'ve ever been in.\" Ron\\'s ears went pink. CHAPTER FOUR At Flourish and Blotts Life at the Burrow was as different as possible from life on Privet Drive. The Dursleys liked everything neat and ordered; the Weasleys\\' house burst with the strange and unexpected. Harry got a shock the first time he looked in the mirror over the kitchen mantelpiece and it shouted, \"Tuck your shirt in, scruffy!\" The ghoul in the attic howled and dropped pipes whenever he felt things were getting too quiet, and small explosions from Fred and George\\'s bedroom were considered perfectly normal. What Harry found most unusual about life at Ron\\'s, however, wasn\\'t the talking mirror or the clanking ghoul: It was the fact that everybody there seemed to like him. Mrs. Weasley fussed over the state of his socks and tried to force him to eat fourth helpings at every meal. Mr. Weasley liked Harry to sit next to him at the dinner table so that he could bombard him with questions about life with Muggles, asking him to explain how things like plugs and the postal service worked. \"Fascinating.\" he would say as Harry talked him through using a telephone. \"Ingenious, really, how many ways Muggles have found of getting along without magic.\" Harry heard from Hogwarts one sunny morning about a week after he had arrived at the Burrow. He and Ron went down to breakfast to find Mr. and Mrs. Weasley and Ginny already sitting at the kitchen table. The moment she saw Harry, Ginny accidentally knocked her porridge bowl to the floor with a loud clatter. Ginny seemed very prone to knocking things over whenever Harry entered a room. She dived under the table to retrieve the bowl and emerged with her face glowing like the setting sun. Pretending he hadn\\'t noticed this, Harry sat down and took the toast Mrs. Weasley offered him. \"Letters from school,\" said Mr. Weasley, passing Harry and Ron identical envelopes of yellowish parchment, addressed in green ink. \"Dumbledore already knows you\\'re here, Harry - doesn\\'t miss a trick, that man. You two\\'ve got them, too,\" he added, as Fred and George ambled in, still in their pajamas. For a few minutes there was silence as they all read their letters. Harry\\'s told him to catch the Hogwarts Express as usual from King\\'s Cross station on September first. There was also a list of the new books he\\'d need for the coming year. SECOND-YEAR STUDENTS WILL REQUIRE: The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2by Miranda Goshawk Break with a Banshee by Gilderoy Lockhart Gadding with Ghouls by Gilderoy Lockhart Holidays with Hags by Gilderoy Lockhart 43 Travels with Trolls by Gilderoy Lockhart Voyages with Vampires by Gilderoy Lockhart Wanderings with Werewolves by Gilderoy Lockhart Year with the Yeti by Gilderoy Lockhart Fred, who had finished his own list, peered over at Harry\\'s. \"You\\'ve been told to get all Lockhart\\'s books, too!\" he said. \"The new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher must be a fan - bet it\\'s a witch.\" At this point, Fred caught his mother\\'s eye and quickly busied himself with the marmalade. \"That lot won\\'t come cheap,\" said George, with a quick look at his parents. \"Lockhart\\'s books are really expensive–\" \"Well, we\\'ll manage,\" said Mrs. Weasley, but she looked worried. \"I expect we\\'ll be able to pick up a lot of Ginny\\'s things secondhand.\" \"Oh, are you starting at Hogwarts this year?\" Harry asked Ginny. She nodded, blushing to the roots of her flaming hair, and put her elbow in the butter dish. Fortunately no one saw this except Harry, because just then Ron\\'s elder brother Percy walked in. He was already dressed, his Hogwarts prefect badge pinned to his sweater vest. \"Morning, all,\" said Percy briskly. \"Lovely day.\" He sat down in the only remaining chair but leapt up again almost immediately, pulling from underneath him a molting, gray feather duster - at least, that was what Harry thought it was, until he saw that it was breathing. \"Errol!\" said Ron, taking the limp owl from Percy and extracting a letter from under its wing. \"Finally - he\\'s got Hermione\\'s answer. I wrote to her saying we were going to try and rescue you from the Dursleys.\" He carried Errol to a perch just inside the back door and tried to stand him on it, but Errol flopped straight off again so Ron lay him on the draining board instead, muttering, \"Pathetic.\" Then he ripped open Hermione\\'s letter and read it out loud: \"`Dear Ron, and Harry if you\\'re there, \"`I hope everything went all right and that Harry is okay and that you didn\\'t do anything illegal to get him out, Ron, because that would get Harry into trouble, too. I\\'ve been really worried and if Harry is all right, will you please let me know at once, but perhaps it would be better if you used a different owl because I think another delivery might finish your one off. \"I\\'m very busy with schoolwork, of course\\' - How can she be?\" said Ron in horror. \"We\\'re on vacation! - ‚and we\\'re going to London next Wednesday to buy my new books. Why don\\'t we meet in Diagon Alley? Let me know what\\'s happening as soon as you can. Love from Hermione.\\'\" \"Well, that fits in nicely, we can go and get all your things then, too,\" said Mrs. Weasley, starting to clear the table. \"What\\'re you all up to today?\" Harry, Ron, Fred, and George were planning to go up the hill to a small paddock the Weasleys owned. It was surrounded by trees that blocked it from view of the village below, meaning that they could practice Quidditch there, as long as they didn\\'t fly too high. They couldn\\'t use real Quidditch balls, which would have been hard to explain if they had escaped and flown away over the village; instead they threw apples for one another to catch. They took turns riding Harry\\'s Nimbus Two Thousand, which was easily the best broom; Ron\\'s old Shooting Star was often outstripped by passing butterflies. Five minutes later they were marching up the hill, broomsticks over their shoulders. They had asked Percy if he wanted to join them, but he had said he was busy. Harry had only seen Percy at mealtimes so far; he stayed shut in his room the rest of the time. \"Wish I knew what he was up to,\" said Fred, frowning. \"He\\'s not himself. His exam results came the day before you did; twelve O.W.L.s and he hardly gloated at all.\" \"Ordinary Wizarding Levels,\" George explained, seeing Harry\\'s puzzled look. \"Bill got twelve, too. If we\\'re not careful, we\\'ll have another Head Boy in the family. I don\\'t think I could stand the shame.\" Bill was the oldest Weasley brother. He and the next brother, Charlie, had already left Hogwarts. Harry had never met either of them, but knew that Charlie was in Romania studying dragons and Bill in Egypt working for the wizard\\'s bank, Gringotts. \"Dunno how Mum and Dad are going to afford all our school stuff this year,\" said George after a while. \"Five sets of Lockhart books! And Ginny needs robes and a wand and everything–\" Harry said nothing. He felt a bit awkward. Stored in an underground vault at Gringotts in London was a small fortune that his parents had left him. Of course, it was only in the wizarding world that he had money; you couldn\\'t use Galleons, Sickles, and Knuts in Muggle shops. He had never mentioned his Gringotts bank account to the Dursleys; he didn\\'t think their horror of anything connected with magic would stretch to a large pile of gold. Mrs. Weasley woke them all early the following Wednesday. After a quick half a dozen bacon sandwiches each, they pulled on their coats and Mrs. Weasley took a flowerpot off the kitchen mantelpiece and peered inside. \"We\\'re running low, Arthur,\" she sighed. \"We\\'ll have to buy some more today– Ah well, guests first! After you, Harry dear!\" And she offered him the flowerpot. Harry stared at them all watching him. \"W-what am I supposed to do?\" he stammered. \"He\\'s never traveled by Floo powder,\" said Ron suddenly. \"Sorry, Harry, I forgot.\" \"Never?\" said Mr. Weasley. \"But how did you get to Diagon Alley to buy your school things last year?\" \"I went on the Underground - \" \"Really?\" said Mr. Weasley eagerly. \"Were there escapators? How exactly - \" \"Not now, Arthur,\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"Floo powder\\'s a lot quicker, dear, but goodness me, if you\\'ve never used it before - \" \"He\\'ll be all right, Mum,\" said Fred. \"Harry, watch us first.\" He took a pinch of glittering powder out of the flowerpot, stepped up to the fire, and threw the powder into the flames. With a roar, the fire turned emerald green and rose higher than Fred, who stepped right into it, shouted, \"Diagon Alley!\" and vanished. \"You must speak clearly, dear,\" Mrs. Weasley told Harry as George dipped his hand into the flowerpot. \"And be sure to get out at the right grate–\" \"The right what?\" said Harry nervously as the fire roared and whipped George out of sight, too. \"Well, there are an awful lot of wizard fires to choose from, you know, but as long as you\\'ve spoken clearly - \" \"He\\'ll be fine, Molly, don\\'t fuss,\" said Mr. Weasley, helping himself to Floo powder too. \"But, dear, if he got lost, how would we ever explain to his aunt and uncle?\" \"They wouldn\\'t mind,\" Harry reassured her. \"Dudley would think it was a brilliant joke if I got lost up a chimney, don\\'t worry about that - \" \"Well– all right– you go after Arthur,\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"Now, when you get into the fire, say where you\\'re going.\" \"And keep your elbows tucked in,\" Ron advised. \"And your eyes shut,\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"The soot - \" \"Don\\'t fidget,\" said Ron. \"Or you might well fall out of the wrong fireplace - \" \"But don\\'t panic and get out too early; wait until you see Fred and George.\" Trying hard to bear all this in mind, Harry took a pinch of Floo powder and walked to the edge of the fire. He took a deep breath, scattered the powder into the flames, and stepped forward; the fire felt like a warm breeze; he opened his mouth and immediately swallowed a lot of hot ash. \"D-Dia-gon Alley,\" he coughed. It felt as though he was being sucked down a giant drain. He seemed to be spinning very fast - the roaring in his ears was deafening - he tried to keep his eyes open but the whirl of green flames made him feel sick - something hard knocked his elbow and he tucked it in tightly, still spinning and spinning - now it felt as though cold hands were slapping his face - squinting through his glasses he saw a blurred stream of fireplaces and snatched glimpses of the rooms beyond - his bacon sandwiches were churning inside him - he closed his eyes again wishing it would stop, and then– He fell, face forward, onto cold stone and felt the bridge of his glasses snap. Dizzy and bruised, covered in soot, he got gingerly to his feet, holding his broken glasses up to his eyes. He was quite alone, but where he was, he had no idea. All he could tell was that he was standing in the stone fireplace of what looked like a large, dimly lit wizard\\'s shop - but nothing in here was ever likely to be on a Hogwarts school list. A glass case nearby held a withered hand on a cushion, a bloodstained pack of cards, and a staring glass eye. Evil-looking masks stared down from the walls, an assortment of human bones lay upon the counter, and rusty, spiked instruments hung from the ceiling. Even worse, the dark, narrow street Harry could see through the dusty shop window was definitely not Diagon Alley. The sooner he got out of here, the better. Nose still stinging where it had hit the hearth, Harry made his way swiftly and silently toward the door, but before he\\'d got halfway toward it, two people appeared on the other side of the glass - and one of them was the very last person Harry wanted to meet when he was lost, covered in soot, and wearing broken glasses: Draco Malfoy. Harry looked quickly around and spotted a large black cabinet to his left; he shot inside it and pulled the doors closed, leaving a small crack to peer through. Seconds later, a bell clanged, and Malfoy stepped into the shop. The man who followed could only be Draco\\'s father. He had the same pale, pointed face and identical cold, gray eyes. Mr. Malfoy crossed the shop, looking lazily at the items on display, and rang a bell on the counter before turning to his son and saying, \"Touch nothing, Draco.\" Malfoy, who had reached for the glass eye, said, \"I thought you were going to buy me a present.\" \"I said I would buy you a racing broom,\" said his father, drumming his fingers on the counter. \"What\\'s the good of that if I\\'m not on the House team?\" said Malfoy, looking sulky and bad-tempered. \"Harry Potter got a Nimbus Two Thousand last year. Special permission from Dumbledore so he could play for Gryffindor. He\\'s not even that good, it\\'s just because he\\'s famous– famous for having a stupid scar on his forehead–\" Malfoy bent down to examine a shelf full of skulls. \"– everyone thinks he\\'s so smart, wonderful Potter with his scar and his broomstick - \" \"You have told me this at least a dozen times already,\" said Mr. Malfoy, with a quelling look at his son. \"And I would remind you that it is not - prudent - to appear less than fond of Harry Potter, not when most of our kind regard him as the hero who made the Dark Lord disappear - ah, Mr. Borgin.\" A stooping man had appeared behind the counter, smoothing his greasy hair back from his face. \"Mr. Malfoy, what a pleasure to see you again,\" said Mr. Borgin in a voice as oily as his hair. \"Delighted - and young Master Malfoy, too - charmed. How may I be of assistance? I must show you, just in today, and very reasonably priced - \" \"I\\'m not buying today, Mr. Borgin, but selling,\" said Mr. Malfoy. \"Selling?\" The smile faded slightly from Mr. Borgin\\'s face. \"You have heard, of course, that the Ministry is conducting more raids,\" said Mr. Malfoy, taking a roll of parchment from his inside pocket and unraveling it for Mr. Borgin to read. \"I have a few - ah - items at home that might embarrass me, if the Ministry were to call–\" Mr. Borgin fixed a pair of pince-nez to his nose and looked down the list. \"The Ministry wouldn\\'t presume to trouble you, sir, surely?\" Mr. Malfoy\\'s lip curled. \"I have not been visited yet. The name Malfoy still commands a certain respect, yet the Ministry grows ever more meddlesome. There are rumors about a new Muggle Protection Act - no doubt that flea-bitten, Muggle-loving fool Arthur Weasley is behind it - \" Harry felt a hot surge of anger. \" - and as you see, certain of these poisons might make it appear - \" \"I understand, sir, of course,\" said Mr. Borgin. \"Let me see–\" \"Can I have that?\" interrupted Draco, pointing at the withered hand on its cushion. \"Ah, the Hand of Glory!\" said Mr. Borgin, abandoning Mr. Malfoy\\'s list and scurrying over to Draco. \"Insert a candle and it gives light only to the holder! Best friend of thieves and plunderers! Your son has fine taste, sir.\" \"I hope my son will amount to more than a thief or a plunderer, Borgin,\" said Mr. Malfoy coldly, and Mr. Borgin said quickly, \"No offense, sir, no offense meant - \" \"Though if his grades don\\'t pick up,\" said Mr. Malfoy, more coldly still, \"that may indeed be all he is fit for - \" \"It\\'s not my fault,\" retorted Draco. \"The teachers all have favorites, that Hermione Granger - \" \"I would have thought you\\'d be ashamed that a girl of no wizard family beat you in every exam,\" snapped Mr. Malfoy. \"Ha!\" said Harry under his breath, pleased to see Draco looking both abashed and angry. \"It\\'s the same all over,\" said Mr. Borgin, in his oily voice. \"Wizard blood is counting for less everywhere - \" \"Not with me,\" said Mr. Malfoy, his long nostrils flaring. \"No, sir, nor with me, sir,\" said Mr. Borgin, with a deep bow. \"In that case, perhaps we can return to my list,\" said Mr. Malfoy shortly. \"I am in something of a hurry, Borgin, I have important business elsewhere today - \" They started to haggle. Harry watched nervously as Draco drew nearer and nearer to his hiding place, examining the objects for sale. Draco paused to examine a long coil of hangman\\'s rope and to read, smirking, the card propped on a magnificent necklace of opals, Caution: Do Not Touch. Cursed - Has Claimed the Lives of Nineteen Muggle Owners to Date. Draco turned away and saw the cabinet right in front of him. He walked forward - he stretched out his hand for the handle \"Done,\" said Mr. Malfoy at the counter. \"Come, Draco - \" Harry wiped his forehead on his sleeve as Draco turned away. \"Good day to you, Mr. Borgin. I\\'ll expect you at the manor tomorrow to pick up the goods.\" The moment the door had closed, Mr. Borgin dropped his oily manner. \"Good day yourself, Mister Malfoy, and if the stories are true, you haven\\'t sold me half of what\\'s hidden in your manor–\" Muttering darkly, Mr. Borgin disappeared into a back room. Harry waited for a minute in case he came back, then, quietly as he could, slipped out of the cabinet, past the glass cases, and out of the shop door. Clutching his broken glasses to his face, Harry stared around. He had emerged into a dingy alleyway that seemed to be made up entirely of shops devoted to the Dark Arts. The one he\\'d just left, Borgin and Burkes, looked like the largest, but opposite was a nasty window display of shrunken heads and, two doors down, a large cage was alive with gigantic black spiders. Two shabby-looking wizards were watching him from the shadow of a doorway, muttering to each other. Feeling jumpy, Harry set off, trying to hold his glasses on straight and hoping against hope he\\'d be able to find a way out of here. An old wooden street sign hanging over a shop selling poisonous candles told him he was in Knockturn Alley. This didn\\'t help, as Harry had never heard of such a place. He supposed he hadn\\'t spoken clearly enough through his mouthful of ashes back in the Weasleys\\' fire. Trying to stay calm, he wondered what to do. \"Not lost are you, my dear?\" said a voice in his ear, making him jump. An aged witch stood in front of him, holding a tray of what looked horribly like whole human fingernails. She leered at him, showing mossy teeth. Harry backed away. \"I\\'m fine, thanks,\" he said. \"I\\'m just - \" \"HARRY! What d\\'yeh think yer doin\\' down there?\" Harry\\'s heart leapt. So did the witch; a load of fingernails cascaded down over her feet and she cursed as the massive form of Hagrid, the Hogwarts\\' gamekeeper, came striding toward them, beetle-black eyes flashing over his great bristling beard. \"Hagrid!\" Harry croaked in relief. \"I was lost - Floo powder - \" Hagrid seized Harry by the scruff of the neck and pulled him away from the witch, knocking the tray right out of her hands. Her shrieks followed them all the way along the twisting alleyway out into bright sunlight. Harry saw a familiar, snow-white marble building in the distance - Gringotts Bank. Hagrid had steered him right into Diagon Alley. \"Yer a mess!\" said Hagrid gruffly, brushing soot off Harry so forcefully he nearly knocked him into a barrel of dragon dung outside an apothecary. \"Skulkin\\' around Knockturn Alley, I dunno dodgy place, Harry - don\\' want no one ter see yeh down there - \" \"I realized that,\" said Harry, ducking as Hagrid made to brush him off again. \"I told you, I was lost - what were you doing down there, anyway?\" \"I was lookin\\' fer a Flesh-Eatin\\' Slug Repellent,\" growled Hagrid. \"They\\'re ruinin\\' the school cabbages. Yer not on yer own?\" \"I\\'m staying with the Weasleys but we got separated,\" Harry explained. \"I\\'ve got to go and find them–\" They set off together down the street. \"How come yeh never wrote back ter me?\" said Hagrid as Harry jogged alongside him (he had to take three steps to every stride of Hagrid\\'s enormous boots). Harry explained all about Dobby and the Dursleys. \"Lousy Muggles,\" growled Hagrid. \"If I\\'d\\'ve known - \" \"Harry! Harry! Over here!\" Harry looked up and saw Hermione Granger standing at the top of the white flight of steps to Gringotts. She ran down to meet them, her bushy brown hair flying behind her. \"What happened to your glasses? Hello, Hagrid - Oh, it\\'s wonderful to see you two again - Are you coming into Gringotts, Harry?\" \"As soon as I\\'ve found the Weasleys,\" said Harry. \"Yeh won\\'t have long ter wait,\" Hagrid said with a grin. Harry and Hermione looked around: Sprinting up the crowded street were Ron, Fred, George, Percy, and Mr. Weasley. \"Harry,\" Mr. Weasley panted. \"We hoped you\\'d only gone one grate too far–\" He mopped his glistening bald patch. \"Molly\\'s frantic - she\\'s coming now - \" \"Where did you come out?\" Ron asked. \"Knockturn Alley,\" said Hagrid grimly. \"Excellent!\" said Fred and George together. \"We\\'ve never been allowed in,\" said Ron enviously. \"I should ruddy well think not,\" growled Hagrid. Mrs. Weasley now came galloping into view, her handbag swinging wildly in one hand, Ginny just clinging onto the other. \"Oh, Harry - oh, my dear - you could have been anywhere - \" Gasping for breath she pulled a large clothes brush out of her bag and began sweeping off the soot Hagrid hadn\\'t managed to beat away. Mr. Weasley took Harry\\'s glasses, gave them a tap of his wand, and returned them, good as new. \"Well, gotta be off,\" said Hagrid, who was having his hand wrung by Mrs. Weasley (\"Knockturn Alley! If you hadn\\'t found him, Hagrid!\"). \"See yer at Hogwarts!\" And he strode away, head and shoulders taller than anyone else in the packed street. \"Guess who I saw in Borgin and Burkes?\" Harry asked Ron and Hermione as they climbed the Gringotts steps. \"Malfoy and his father.\" \"Did Lucius Malfoy buy anything?\" said Mr. Weasley sharply behind them. \"No, he was selling - \" \"So he\\'s worried,\" said Mr. Weasley with grim satisfaction. \"Oh, I\\'d love to get Lucius Malfoy for something–\" \"You be careful, Arthur,\" said Mrs. Weasley sharply as they were bowed into the bank by a goblin at the door. \"That family\\'s trouble. Don\\'t go biting off more than you can chew - \" \"So you don\\'t think I\\'m a match for Lucius Malfoy?\" said Mr. Weasley indignantly, but he was distracted almost at once by the sight of Hermione\\'s parents, who were standing nervously at the counter that ran all along the great marble hall, waiting for Hermione to introduce them. \"But you\\'re Muggles!\" said Mr. Weasley delightedly. \"We must have a drink! What\\'s that you\\'ve got there? Oh, you\\'re changing Muggle money. Molly, look!\" He pointed excitedly at the ten-pound notes in Mr. Granger\\'s hand. \"Meet you back here,\" Ron said to Hermione as the Weasleys and Harry were led off to their underground vaults by another Gringotts goblin. The vaults were reached by means of small, goblin-driven carts that sped along miniature train tracks through the bank\\'s underground tunnels. Harry enjoyed the breakneck journey down to the Weasleys\\' vault, but felt dreadful, far worse than he had in Knockturn Alley, when it was opened. There was a very small pile of silver Sickles inside, and just one gold Galleon. Mrs. Weasley felt right into the corners before sweeping the whole lot into her bag. Harry felt even worse when they reached his vault. He tried to block the contents from view as he hastily shoved handfuls of coins into a leather bag. Back outside on the marble steps, they all separated. Percy muttered vaguely about needing a new quill. Fred and George had spotted their friend from Hogwarts, Lee Jordan. Mrs. Weasley and Ginny were going to a secondhand robe shop. Mr. Weasley was insisting on taking the Grangers off to the Leaky Cauldron for a drink. \"We\\'ll all meet at Flourish and Blotts in an hour to buy your schoolbooks,\" said Mrs. Weasley, setting off with Ginny. \"And not one step down Knockturn Alley!\" she shouted at the twins\\' retreating backs. Harry, Ron, and Hermione strolled off along the winding, cobbled street. The bag of gold, silver, and bronze jangling cheerfully in Harry\\'s pocket was clamoring to be spent, so he bought three large strawberry-and-peanut-butter ice creams, which they slurped happily as they wandered up the alley, examining the fascinating shop windows. Ron gazed longingly at a full set of Chudley Cannon robes in the windows of Quality Quidditch Supplies until Hermione dragged them off to buy ink and parchment next door. In Gambol and Japes Wizarding Joke Shop, they met Fred, George, and Lee Jordan, who were stocking up on Dr. Filibuster\\'s Fabulous Wet-Start, No-Heat Fireworks, and in a tiny junk shop full of broken wands, lopsided brass scales, and old cloaks covered in potion stains they found Percy, deeply immersed in a small and deeply boring book called Prefects Who Gained Power. \"A study of Hogwarts prefects and their later careers,\" Ron read aloud off the back cover. \"That sounds fascinating–\" \"Go away,\" Percy snapped. \"\\'Course, he\\'s very ambitious, Percy, he\\'s got it all planned out– He wants to be Minister of Magic–\" Ron told Harry and Hermione in an undertone as they left Percy to it. An hour later, they headed for Flourish and Blotts. They were by no means the only ones making their way to the bookshop. As they approached it, they saw to their surprise a large crowd jostling outside the doors, trying to get in. The reason for this was proclaimed by a large banner stretched across the upper windows: GILDEROY LOCKHART will be signing copies of his autobiography MAGICAL ME today 12:30P.M.to 4:30P.M. \"We can actually meet him!\" Hermione squealed. \"I mean, he\\'s written almost the whole booklist!\" The crowd seemed to be made up mostly of witches around Mrs. Weasley\\'s age. A harassed-looking wizard stood at the door, saying, \"Calmly, please, ladies– Don\\'t push, there– mind the books, now–\" Harry, Ron, and Hermione squeezed inside. A long line wound right to the back of the shop, where Gilderoy Lockhart was signing his books. They each grabbed a copy of The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2 and sneaked up the line to where the rest of the Weasleys were standing with Mr. and Mrs. Granger. \"Oh, there you are, good,\" said Mrs. Weasley. She sounded breathless and kept patting her hair. \"We\\'ll be able to see him in a minute–\" Gilderoy Lockhart came slowly into view, seated at a table surrounded by large pictures of his own face, all winking and flashing dazzlingly white teeth at the crowd. The real Lockhart was wearing robes of forget-me-not blue that exactly matched his eyes; his pointed wizard\\'s hat was set at a jaunty angle on his wavy hair. A short, irritable-looking man was dancing around taking photographs with a large black camera that emitted puffs of purple smoke with every blinding flash. \"Out of the way, there,\" he snarled at Ron, moving back to get a better shot. \"This is for the Daily Prophet - \" \"Big deal,\" said Ron, rubbing his foot where the photographer had stepped on it. Gilderoy Lockhart heard him. He looked up. He saw Ron - and then he saw Harry. He stared. Then he leapt to his feet and positively shouted, \"It can\\'t be Harry Potter?\" The crowd parted, whispering excitedly; Lockhart dived forward, seized Harry\\'s arm, and pulled him to the front. The crowd burst into applause. Harry\\'s face burned as Lockhart shook his hand for the photographer, who was clicking away madly, wafting thick smoke over the Weasleys. \"Nice big smile, Harry,\" said Lockhart, through his own gleaming teeth. \"Together, you and I are worth the front page.\" When he finally let go of Harry\\'s hand, Harry could hardly feel his fingers. He tried to sidle back over to the Weasleys, but Lockhart threw an arm around his shoulders and clamped him tightly to his side. \"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he said loudly, waving for quiet. \"What an extraordinary moment this is! The perfect moment for me to make a little announcement I\\'ve been sitting on for some time! \"When young Harry here stepped into Flourish and Blotts today, he only wanted to buy my autobiography - which I shall be happy to present him now, free of charge - \" The crowd applauded again. \"He had no idea,\" Lockhart continued, giving Harry a little shake that made his glasses slip to the end of his nose, \"that he would shortly be getting much, much more than my book, Magical Me. He and his schoolmates will, in fact, be getting the real magical me. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, I have great pleasure and pride in announcing that this September, I will be taking up the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry!\" The crowd cheered and clapped and Harry found himself being presented with the entire works of Gilderoy Lockhart. Staggering slightly under their weight, he managed to make his way out of the limelight to the edge of the room, where Ginny was standing next to her new cauldron. \"You have these,\" Harry mumbled to her, tipping the books into the cauldron. \"I\\'ll buy my own - \" \"Bet you loved that, didn\\'t you, Potter?\" said a voice Harry had no trouble recognizing. He straightened up and found himself face-to-face with Draco Malfoy, who was wearing his usual sneer. \"Famous Harry Potter,\" said Malfoy. \"Can\\'t even go into a bookshop without making the front page.\" \"Leave him alone, he didn\\'t want all that!\" said Ginny. It was the first time she had spoken in front of Harry. She was glaring at Malfoy. \"Potter, you\\'ve got yourself a girlfriend!\" drawled Malfoy. Ginny went scarlet as Ron and Hermione fought their way over, both clutching stacks of Lockhart\\'s books. \"Oh, it\\'s you,\" said Ron, looking at Malfoy as if he were something unpleasant on the sole of his shoe. \"Bet you\\'re surprised to see Harry here, eh?\" \"Not as surprised as I am to see you in a shop, Weasley,\" retorted Malfoy. \"I suppose your parents will go hungry for a month to pay for all those.\" Ron went as red as Ginny. He dropped his books into the cauldron, too, and started toward Malfoy, but Harry and Hermione grabbed the back of his jacket. \"Ron!\" said Mr. Weasley, struggling over with Fred and George. \"What are you doing? It\\'s too crowded in here, let\\'s go outside.\" \"Well, well, well - Arthur Weasley.\" It was Mr. Malfoy. He stood with his hand on Draco\\'s shoulder, sneering in just the same way. \"Lucius,\" said Mr. Weasley, nodding coldly. \"Busy time at the Ministry, I hear,\" said Mr. Malfoy. \"All those raids– I hope they\\'re paying you overtime?\" He reached into Ginny\\'s cauldron and extracted, from amid the glossy Lockhart books, a very old, very battered copy of A Beginner\\'s Guide to Transfiguration. \"Obviously not,\" Mr. Malfoy said. \"Dear me, what\\'s the use of being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they don\\'t even pay you well for it?\" Mr. Weasley flushed darker than either Ron or Ginny. \"We have a very different idea of what disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy,\" he said. \"Clearly,\" said Mr. Malfoy, his pale eyes straying to Mr. and Mrs. Granger, who were watching apprehensively. \"The company you keep, Weasley– and I thought your family could sink no lower.\" There was a thud of metal as Ginny\\'s cauldron went flying; Mr. Weasley had thrown himself at Mr. Malfoy, knocking him backward into a bookshelf. Dozens of heavy spellbooks came thundering down on all their heads; there was a yell of, \"Get him, Dad!\" from Fred or George; Mrs. Weasley was shrieking, \"No, Arthur, no!\"; the crowd stampeded backward, knocking more shelves over; \"Gentlemen, please - please!\" cried the assistant, and then, louder than all - \"Break it up, there, gents, break it up - \" Hagrid was wading toward them through the sea of books. In an instant he had pulled Mr. Weasley and Mr. Malfoy apart. Mr. Weasley had a cut lip and Mr. Malfoy had been hit in the eye by an Encyclopedia of Toadstools. He was still holding Ginny\\'s old Transfiguration book. He thrust it at her, his eyes glittering with malice. \"Here, girl - take your book - it\\'s the best your father can give you - \" Pulling himself out of Hagrid\\'s grip he beckoned to Draco and swept from the shop. \"Yeh should\\'ve ignored him, Arthur,\" said Hagrid, almost lifting Mr. Weasley off his feet as he straightened his robes. \"Rotten ter the core, the whole family, everyone knows that - no Malfoy\\'s worth listenin\\' ter - bad blood, that\\'s what it is - come on now - let\\'s get outta here.\" The assistant looked as though he wanted to stop them leaving, but he barely came up to Hagrid\\'s waist and seemed to think better of it. They hurried up the street, the Grangers shaking with fright and Mrs. Weasley beside herself with fury. \"A fine example to set for your children– brawling in public– what Gilderoy Lockhart must\\'ve thought - \" \"He was pleased,\" said Fred. \"Didn\\'t you hear him as we were leaving? He was asking that bloke from the Daily Prophet if he\\'d be able to work the fight into his report - said it was all publicity - \" But it was a subdued group that headed back to the fireside in the Leaky Cauldron, where Harry, the Weasleys, and all their shopping would be traveling back to the Burrow using Floo powder. They said good-bye to the Grangers, who were leaving the pub for the Muggle street on the other side; Mr. Weasley started to ask them how bus stops worked, but stopped quickly at the look on Mrs. Weasley\\'s face. Harry took off his glasses and put them safely in his pocket before helping himself to Floo powder. It definitely wasn\\'t his favorite way to travel. CHAPTER FIVE The Whomping Willow The end of the summer vacation came too quickly for Harry\\'s liking. He was looking forward to getting back to Hogwarts, but his month at the Burrow had been the happiest of his life. It was difficult not to feel jealous of Ron when he thought of the Dursleys and the sort of welcome he could expect next time he turned up on Privet Drive. On their last evening, Mrs. Weasley conjured up a sumptuous dinner that included all of Harry\\'s favorite things, ending with a mouthwatering treacle pudding. Fred and George rounded off the evening with a display of Filibuster fireworks; they filled the kitchen with red and blue stars that bounced from ceiling to wall for at least half an hour. Then it was time for a last mug of hot chocolate and bed. It took a long while to get started next morning. They were up at dawn, but somehow they still seemed to have a great deal to do. Mrs. Weasley dashed about in a bad mood looking for spare socks and quills; people kept colliding on the stairs, half-dressed with bits of toast in their hands; and Mr. Weasley nearly broke his neck, tripping over a stray chicken as he crossed the yard carrying Ginny\\'s trunk to the car. Harry couldn\\'t see how eight people, six large trunks, two owls, and a rat were going to fit into one small Ford Anglia. He had reckoned, of course, without the special features that Mr. Weasley had added. \"Not a word to Molly,\" he whispered to Harry as he opened the trunk and showed him how it had been magically expanded so that the luggage fitted easily. When at last they were all in the car, Mrs. Weasley glanced into the back seat, where Harry, Ron, Fred, George, and Percy were all sitting comfortably side by side, and said, \"Muggles do know more than we give them credit for, don\\'t they?\" She and Ginny got into the front seat, which had been stretched so that it resembled a park bench. \"I mean, you\\'d never know it was this roomy from the outside, would you?\" Mr. Weasley started up the engine and they trundled out of the yard, Harry turning back for a last look at the house. He barely had time to wonder when he\\'d see it again when they were back. George had forgotten his box of Filibuster fireworks. Five minutes after that, they skidded to a halt in the yard so that Fred could run in for his broomstick. They had almost reached the highway when Ginny shrieked that she\\'d left her diary. By the time she had clambered back into the car, they were running very late, and tempers were running high. Mr. Weasley glanced at his watch and then at his wife. \"Molly, dear - \" \"No, Arthur - Œ\" \"No one would see - this little button here is an Invisibility Booster I installed - that\\'d get us up in the air - then we fly above the clouds. We\\'d be there in ten minutes and no one would be any the wiser - \" \"I said no, Arthur, not in broad daylight - \" They reached King\\'s Cross at a quarter to eleven. Mr. Weasley dashed across the road to get trolleys for their trunks and they all hurried into the station. Harry had caught the Hogwarts Express the previous year. The tricky part was getting onto platform nine and three-quarters, which wasn\\'t visible to the Muggle eye. What you had to do was walk through the solid barrier dividing platforms nine and ten. It didn\\'t hurt, but it had to be done carefully so that none of the Muggles noticed you vanishing. \"Percy first,\" said Mrs. Weasley, looking nervously at the clock overhead, which showed they had only five minutes to disappear casually through the barrier. Percy strode briskly forward and vanished. Mr. Weasley went next; Fred and George followed. \"I\\'ll take Ginny and you two come right after us,\" Mrs. Weasley told Harry and Ron, grabbing Ginny\\'s hand and setting off. In the blink of an eye they were gone. \"Let\\'s go together, we\\'ve only got a minute,\" Ron said to Harry. Harry made sure that Hedwig\\'s cage was safely wedged on top of his trunk and wheeled his trolley around to face the barrier. He felt perfectly confident; this wasn\\'t nearly as uncomfortable as using Floo powder. Both of them bent low over the handles of their trolleys and walked purposefully toward the barrier, gathering speed. A few feet away from it, they broke into a run and - CRASH. Both trolleys hit the barrier and bounced backward; Ron\\'s trunk fell off with a loud thump, Harry was knocked off his feet, and Hedwig\\'s cage bounced onto the shiny floor, and she rolled away, shrieking indignantly; people all around them stared and a guard nearby yelled, \"What in blazes d\\'you think you\\'re doing?\" \"Lost control of the trolley,\" Harry gasped, clutching his ribs as he got up. Ron ran to pick up Hedwig, who was causing such a scene that there was a lot of muttering about cruelty to animals from the surrounding crowd. \"Why can\\'t we get through?\" Harry hissed to Ron. \"I dunno - \" Ron looked wildly around. A dozen curious people were still watching them. \"We\\'re going to miss the train,\" Ron whispered. \"I don\\'t understand why the gateway\\'s sealed itself - \" Harry looked up at the giant clock with a sickening feeling in the pit of his stomach. Ten seconds– nine seconds– He wheeled his trolley forward cautiously until it was right against the barrier and pushed with all his might. The metal remained solid. Three seconds– two seconds– one second– \"It\\'s gone,\" said Ron, sounding stunned. \"The train\\'s left. What if Mum and Dad can\\'t get back through to us? Have you got any Muggle money?\" Harry gave a hollow laughed. \"The Dursleys haven\\'t given me pocket money for about six years.\" Ron pressed his ear to the cold barrier. \"Can\\'t hear a thing,\" he said tensely, \"What\\'re we going to do? I don\\'t know how long it\\'ll take Mum and Dad to get back to us.\" They looked around. People were still watching them, mainly because of Hedwig\\'s continuing screeches. \"I think we\\'d better go and wait by the car,\" said Harry. \"We\\'re attracting too much atten - \" \"Harry!\" said Ron, his eyes gleaming. \"The car!\" \"What about it?\" \"We can fly the car to Hogwarts!\" \"But I thought - \" \"We\\'re stuck, right? And we\\'ve got to get to school, haven\\'t we? And even underage wizards are allowed to use magic if it\\'s a real emergency, section nineteen or something of the Restriction of Thingy - \" \"But your Mum and Dad–\" said Harry, pushing against the barrier again in the vain hope that it would give way. \"How will they get home?\" \"They don\\'t need the car!\" said Ron impatiently. \"They know how to Apparate! You know, just vanish and reappear at home! They only bother with Floo powder and the car because we\\'re all underage and we\\'re not allowed to Apparate yet–\" Harry\\'s feeling of panic turned suddenly to excitement. \"Can you fly it?\" \"No, problem,\" said Ron, wheeling his trolley around to face the exit. \"C\\'mon, let\\'s go. If we hurry we\\'ll be able to follow the Hogwarts Express - \" And they marched off through the crowd of curious Muggles, out of the station and back onto the side road where the old Ford Anglia was parked. Ron unlocked the cavernous trunk with a series of taps from his wand. They heaved their luggage back in, put Hedwig on the back seat, and got into the front. \"Check that no one\\'s watching,\" said Ron, starting the ignition with another tap of his wand. Harry stuck his head out of the window: Traffic was rumbling along the main road ahead, but their street was empty. \"Okay,\" he said. Ron pressed a tiny silver button on the dashboard. The car around them vanished - and so did they. Harry could feel the seat vibrating beneath him, hear the engine, feel his hands on his knees and his glasses on his nose, but for all he could see, he had become a pair of eyeballs, floating a few feet above the ground in a dingy street full of parked cars. \"Let\\'s go,\" said Ron\\'s voice from his right. And the ground and the dirty buildings on either side fell away, dropping out of sight as the car rose; in seconds, the whole of London lay, smoky and glittering, below them. Then there was a popping noise and the car, Harry, and Ron reappeared. \"Uh-oh,\" said Ron, jabbing at the Invisibility Booster. \"It\\'s faulty - \" Both of them pummeled it. The car vanished. Then it flickered back again. \"Hold on!\" Ron yelled, and he slammed his foot on the accelerator; they shot straight into the low, woolly clouds and everything turned dull and foggy. \"Now what?\" said Harry, blinking at the solid mass of cloud pressing in on them from all sides. \"We need to see the train to know what direction to go in,\" said Ron. \"Dip back down again - quickly - \" They dropped back beneath the clouds and twisted around in their seats, squinting at the ground. \"I can see it!\" Harry yelled. \"Right ahead - there!\" The Hogwarts Express was streaking along below them like a scarlet snake. \"Due north,\" said Ron, checking the compass on the dashboard. \"Okay, we\\'ll just have to check on it every half hour or so - hold on - \" And they shot up through the clouds. A minute later, they burst out into a blaze of sunlight. It was a different world. The wheels of the car skimmed the sea of fluffy cloud, the sky a bright, endless blue under the blinding white sun. \"All we\\'ve got to worry about now are airplanes,\" said Ron. They looked at each other and started to laugh; for a long time, they couldn\\'t stop. It was as though they had been plunged into a fabulous dream. This, thought Harry, was surely the only way to travel - past swirls and turrets of snowy cloud, in a car full of hot, bright sunlight, with a fat pack of toffees in the glove compartment, and the prospect of seeing Fred\\'s and George\\'s jealous faces when they landed smoothly and spectacularly on the sweeping lawn in front of Hogwarts castle. They made regular checks on the train as they flew farther and farther north, each dip beneath the clouds showing them a different view. London was soon far behind them, replaced by neat green fields that gave way in turn to wide, purplish moors, a great city alive with cars like multicolored ants, villages with tiny toy churches. Several uneventful hours later, however, Harry had to admit that some of the fun was wearing off. The toffees had made them extremely thirsty and they had nothing to drink. He and Ron had pulled off their sweaters, but Harry\\'s T-shirt was sticking to the back of his seat and his glasses kept sliding down to the end of his sweaty nose. He had stopped noticing the fantastic cloud shapes now and was thinking longingly of the train miles below, where you could buy ice-cold pumpkin juice from a trolley pushed by a plump witch. Why hadn\\'t they been able to get onto platform nine and three-quarters? \"Can\\'t be much further, can it?\" croaked Ron, hours later still, as the sun started to sink into their floor of cloud, staining it a deep pink. \"Ready for another check on the train?\" It was still right below them, winding its way past a snowcapped mountain. It was much darker beneath the canopy of clouds. Ron put his foot on the accelerator and drove them upward again, but as he did so, the engine began to whine. Harry and Ron exchanged nervous glances. \"It\\'s probably just tired,\" said Ron. \"It\\'s never been this far before–\" And they both pretended not to notice the whining growing louder and louder as the sky became steadily darker. Stars were blossoming in the blackness. Harry pulled his sweater back on, trying to ignore the way the windshield wipers were now waving feebly, as though in protest. \"Not far,\" said Ron, more to the car than to Harry, \"not far now,\" and he patted the dashboard nervously. When they flew back beneath the clouds a little while later, they had to squint through the darkness for a landmark they knew. \"There!\" Harry shouted, making Ron and Hedwig jump. \"Straight ahead!\" Silhouetted on the dark horizon, high on the cliff over the lake, stood the many turrets and towers of Hogwarts castle. But the car had begun to shudder and was losing speed. \"Come on,\" Ron said cajolingly, giving the steering wheel a little shake, \"nearly there, come on - \" The engine groaned. Narrow jets of steam were issuing from under the hood. Harry found himself gripping the edges of his seat very hard as they flew toward the lake. The car gave a nasty wobble. Glancing out of his window, Harry saw the smooth, black, glassy surface of the water, a mile below. Ron\\'s knuckles were white on the steering wheel. The car wobbled again. \"Come on,\" Ron muttered. They were over the lake - the castle was right ahead - Ron put his foot down. There was a loud clunk, a splutter, and the engine died completely. \"Uh-oh,\" said Ron, into the silence. The nose of the car dropped. They were falling, gathering speed, heading straight for the solid castle wall. \"Noooooo!\" Ron yelled, swinging the steering wheel around; they missed the dark stone wall by inches as the car turned in a great arc, soaring over the dark greenhouses, then the vegetable patch, and then out over the black lawns, losing altitude all the time. Ron let go of the steering wheel completely and pulled his wand out of his back pocket - \"STOP! STOP!\" he yelled, whacking the dashboard and the windshield, but they were still plummeting, the ground flying up toward them - \"WATCH OUT FOR THAT TREE!\" Harry bellowed, lunging for the steering wheel, but too late - CRUNCH. With an earsplitting bang of metal on wood, they hit the thick tree trunk and dropped to the ground with a heavy jolt. Steam was billowing from under the crumpled hood; Hedwig was shrieking in terror; a golfball-size lump was throbbing on Harry\\'s head where he had hit the windshield; and to his right, Ron let out a low, despairing groan. \"Are you okay?\" Harry said urgently. \"My wand,\" said Ron, in a shaky voice. \"Look at my wand - \" It had snapped, almost in two; the tip was dangling limply, held on by a few splinters. Harry opened his mouth to say he was sure they\\'d be able to mend it up at the school, but he never even got started. At that very moment, something hit his side of the car with the force of a charging bull, sending him lurching sideways into Ron, just as an equally heavy blow hit the roof. \"What\\'s happen - ?\" Ron gasped, staring through the windshield, and Harry looked around just in time to see a branch as thick as a python smash into it. The tree they had hit was attacking them. Its trunk was bent almost double, and its gnarled boughs were pummeling every inch of the car it could reach. \"Aaargh!\" said Ron as another twisted limb punched a large dent into his door; the windshield was now trembling under a hail of blows from knuckle-like twigs and a branch as thick as a battering ram was pounding furiously on the roof, which seemed to be caving in. \"Run for it!\" Ron shouted, throwing his full weight against his door, but next second he had been knocked backward into Harry\\'s lap by a vicious uppercut from another branch. \"We\\'re done for!\" he moaned as the ceiling sagged, but suddenly the floor of the car was vibrating - the engine had restarted. \"Reverse!\" Harry yelled, and the car shot backward; the tree was still trying to hit them; they could hear its roots creaking as it almost ripped itself up, lashing out at them as they sped out of reach. \"That,\" panted Ron, \"was close. Well done, car - \" The car, however, had reached the end of its tether. With two sharp clunks, the doors flew open and Harry felt his seat tip sideways: Next thing he knew he was sprawled on the damp ground. Loud thuds told him that the car was ejecting their luggage from the trunk; Hedwig\\'s cage flew through the air and burst open; she rose out of it with an angry screech and sped off toward the castle without a backward look. Then, dented, scratched, and steaming, the car rumbled off into the darkness, its rear lights blazing angrily. \"Come back!\" Ron yelled after it, brandishing his broken wand. \"Dad\\'ll kill me!\" But the car disappeared from view with one last snort from its exhaust. \"Can you believe our luck?\" said Ron miserably, bending down to pick up Scabbers. \"Of all the trees we could\\'ve hit, we had to get one that hits back.\" He glanced over his shoulder at the ancient tree, which was still flailing its branches threateningly. \"Come on,\" said Harry wearily, \"we\\'d better get up to the school–\" It wasn\\'t at all the triumphant arrival they had pictured. Stiff, cold, and bruised, they seized the ends of their trunks and began dragging them up the grassy slope, toward the great oak front doors. \"I think the feast\\'s already started,\" said Ron, dropping his trunk at the foot of the front steps and crossing quietly to look through a brightly lit window. \"Hey - Harry - come and look - it\\'s the Sorting!\" Harry hurried over and, together, he and Ron peered in at the Great Hall. Innumerable candles were hovering in midair over four long, crowded tables, making the golden plates and goblets sparkle. Overhead, the bewitched ceiling, which always mirrored the sky outside, sparkled with stars. Through the forest of pointed black Hogwarts hats, Harry saw a long line of scared-looking first years filing into the Hall. Ginny was among them, easily visible because of her vivid Weasley hair. Meanwhile, Professor McGonagall, a bespectacled witch with her hair in a tight bun, was placing the famous Hogwarts Sorting Hat on a stool before the newcomers. Every year, this aged old hat, patched, frayed, and dirty, sorted new students into the four Hogwarts houses (Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin). Harry well remembered putting it on, exactly one year ago, and waiting, petrified, for its decision as it muttered aloud in his ear. For a few horrible seconds he had feared that the hat was going to put him in Slytherin, the house that had turned out more Dark witches and wizards than any other but he had ended up in Gryffindor, along with Ron, Hermione, and the rest of the Weasleys. Last term, Harry and Ron had helped Gryffindor win the House Championship, beating Slytherin for the first time in seven years. A very small, mousy-haired boy had been called forward to place the hat on his head. Harry\\'s eyes wandered past him to where Professor Dumbledore, the headmaster, sat watching the Sorting from the staff table, his long silver beard and half-moon glasses shining brightly in the candlelight. Several seats along, Harry saw Gilderoy Lockhart, dressed in robes of aquamarine. And there at the end was Hagrid, huge and hairy, drinking deeply from his goblet. \"Hang on–\" Harry muttered to Ron. \"There\\'s an empty chair at the staff table– Where\\'s Snape?\" Professor Severus Snape was Harry\\'s least favorite teacher. Harry also happened to be Snape\\'s least favorite student. Cruel, sarcastic, and disliked by everybody except the students from his own house (Slytherin), Snape taught Potions. \"Maybe he\\'s ill!\" said Ron hopefully. \"Maybe he\\'s left,\" said Harry, \"because he missed out on the Defense Against Dark Arts job again!\" \"Or he might have been sacked!\" said Ron enthusiastically. \"I mean, everyone hates him - \" \"Or maybe,\" said a very cold voice right behind them, \"he\\'s waiting to hear why you two didn\\'t arrive on the school train.\" Harry spun around. There, his black robes rippling in a cold breeze, stood Severus Snape. He was a thin man with sallow skin, a hooked nose, and greasy, shoulder-length black hair, and at this moment, he was smiling in a way that told Harry he and Ron were in very deep trouble. \"Follow me,\" said Snape. Not daring even to look at each other, Harry and Ron followed Snape up the steps into the vast, echoing entrance hall, which was lit with flaming torches. A delicious smell of food was wafting from the Great Hall, but Snape led them away from the warmth and light, down a narrow stone staircase that led into the dungeons. \"In!\" he said, opening a door halfway down the cold passageway and pointing. They entered Snape\\'s office, shivering. The shadowy walls were lined with shelves of large glass jars, in which floated all manner of revolting things Harry didn\\'t really want to know the name of at the moment. The fireplace was dark and empty. Snape closed the door and turned to look at them. \"So,\" he said softly, \"the train isn\\'t good enough for the famous Harry Potter and his faithful sidekick Weasley. Wanted to arrive with a bang, did we, boys?\" \"No, sir, it was the barrier at King\\'s Cross, it - \" \"Silence!\" said Snape coldly. \"What have you done with the car?\" Ron gulped. This wasn\\'t the first time Snape had given Harry the impression of being able to read minds. But a moment later, he understood, as Snape unrolled today\\'s issue of the Evening Prophet. \"You were seen,\" he hissed, showing them the headline: FLYING FORD ANGLIA MYSTIFIES MUGGLES. He began to read aloud: \"Two Muggles in London, convinced they saw an old car flying over the Post Office tower– at noon in Norfolk, Mrs. Hetty Bayliss, while hanging out her washing– Mr. Angus Fleet, of Peebles, reported to police– Six or seven Muggles in all. I believe your father works in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office?\" he said, looking up at Ron and smiling still more nastily. \"Dear, dear– his own son–\" Harry felt as though he\\'d just been walloped in the stomach by one of the mad tree\\'s larger branches. If anyone found out Mr. Weasley had bewitched the car– he hadn\\'t thought of that– \"I noticed, in my search of the park, that considerable damage seems to have been done to a very valuable Whomping Willow,\" Snape went on. \"That tree did more damage to us than we - \" Ron blurted out. \"Silence!\" snapped Snape again. \"Most unfortunately, you are not in my House and the decision to expel you does not rest with me. I shall go and fetch the people who do have that happy power. You will wait here.\" Harry and Ron stared at each other, white-faced. Harry didn\\'t feel hungry any more. He now felt extremely sick. He tried not to look at a large, slimy something suspended in green liquid on a shelf behind Snape\\'s desk. If Snape had gone to fetch Professor McGonagall, head of Gryffindor House, they were hardly any better off. She might be fairer than Snape, but she was still extremely strict. Ten minutes later, Snape returned, and sure enough it was Professor McGonagall who accompanied him. Harry had seen Professor McGonagall angry on several occasions, but either he had forgotten just how thin her mouth could go, or he had never seen her this angry before. She raised her wand the moment she entered; Harry and Ron both flinched, but she merely pointed it at the empty fireplace, where flames suddenly erupted. \"Sit,\" she said, and they both backed into chairs by the fire. \"Explain,\" she said, her glasses glinting ominously. Ron launched into the story, starting with the barrier at the station refusing to let them through. \" - so we had no choice, Professor, we couldn\\'t get on the train.\" \"Why didn\\'t you send us a letter by owl? I believe you have an owl?\" Professor McGonagall said coldly to Harry. Harry gaped at her. Now she said it, that seemed the obvious thing to have done. \"I - I didn\\'t think - \" \"That,\" said Professor McGonagall, \"is obvious.\" There was a knock on the office door and Snape, now looking happier than ever, opened it. There stood the headmaster, Professor Dumbledore. Harry\\'s whole body went numb. Dumbledore was looking unusually grave. He stared down his very crooked nose at them, and Harry suddenly found himself wishing he and Ron were still being beaten up by the Whomping Willow. There was a long silence. Then Dumbledore said, \"Please explain why you did this.\" It would have been better if he had shouted. Harry hated the disappointment in his voice. For some reason, he was unable to look Dumbledore in the eyes, and spoke instead to his knees. He told Dumbledore everything except that Mr. Weasley owned the bewitched car, making it sound as though he and Ron had happened to find a flying car parked outside the station. He knew Dumbledore would see through this at once, but Dumbledore asked no questions about the car. When Harry had finished, he merely continued to peer at them through his spectacles. \"We\\'ll go and get our stuff,\" said Ron in a hopeless sort of voice. \"What are you talking about, Weasley?\" barked Professor McGonagall. \"Well, you\\'re expelling us, aren\\'t you?\" said Ron. Harry looked quickly at Dumbledore. \"Not today, Mr. Weasley,\" said Dumbledore. \"But I must impress upon both of you the seriousness of what you have done. I will be writing to both your families tonight. I must also warn you that if you do anything like this again, I will have no choice but to expel you.\" Snape looked as though Christmas had been canceled. He cleared his throat and said, \"Professor Dumbledore, these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry, caused serious damage to an old and valuable tree - surely acts of this nature - \" \"It will be for Professor McGonagall to decide on these boys\\' punishments, Severus,\" said Dumbledore calmly. \"They are in her House and are therefore her responsibility.\" He turned to Professor McGonagall. \"I must go back to the feast, Minerva, I\\'ve got to give out a few notices. Come, Severus, there\\'s a delicious-looking custard tart I want to sample - \" Snape shot a look of pure venom at Harry and Ron as he allowed himself to be swept out of his office, leaving them alone with Professor McGonagall, who was still eyeing them like a wrathful eagle. \"You\\'d better get along to the hospital wing, Weasley, you\\'re bleeding.\" \"Not much,\" said Ron, hastily wiping the cut over his eye with his sleeve. \"Professor, I wanted to watch my sister being Sorted - \" \"The Sorting Ceremony is over,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"Your sister is also in Gryffindor.\" \"Oh, good,\" said Ron. \"And speaking of Gryffindor - \" Professor McGonagall said sharply, but Harry cut in: \"Professor, when we took the car, term hadn\\'t started, so - so Gryffindor shouldn\\'t really have points taken from it - should it?\" he finished, watching her anxiously. Professor McGonagall gave him a piercing look, but he was sure she had almost smiled. Her mouth looked less thin, anyway. \"I will not take any points from Gryffindor,\" she said, and Harry\\'s heart lightened considerably. \"But you will both get a detention.\" It was better than Harry had expected. As for Dumbledore\\'s writing to the Dursleys, that was nothing. Harry knew perfectly well they\\'d just be disappointed that the Whomping Willow hadn\\'t squashed him flat. Professor McGonagall raised her wand again and pointed it at Snape\\'s desk. A large plate of sandwiches, two silver goblets, and a jug of iced pumpkin juice appeared with a pop. \"You will eat in here and then go straight up to your dormitory,\" she said. \"I must also return to the feast.\" When the door had closed behind her, Ron let out a long, low whistle. \"I thought we\\'d had it,\" he said, grabbing a sandwich. \"So did I,\" said Harry, taking one, too. \"Can you believe our luck, though?\" said Ron thickly through a mouthful of chicken and ham. \"Fred and George must\\'ve flown that car five or six times and no Muggle ever saw them.\" He swallowed and took another huge bite. \"Why couldn\\'t we get through the barrier?\" Harry shrugged. \"We\\'ll have to watch our step from now on, though,\" he said, taking a grateful swig of pumpkin juice. \"Wish we could\\'ve gone up to the feast–\" \"She didn\\'t want us showing off,\" said Ron sagely. \"Doesn\\'t want people to think it\\'s clever, arriving by flying car.\" When they had eaten as many sandwiches as they could (the plate kept refilling itself) they rose and left the office, treading the familiar path to Gryffindor Tower. The castle was quiet; it seemed that the feast was over. They walked past muttering portraits and creaking suits of armor, and climbed narrow flights of stone stairs, until at last they reached the passage where the secret entrance to Gryffindor Tower was hidden, behind an oil painting of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress. \"Password?\" she said as they approached. \"Er - \" said Harry. They didn\\'t know the new year\\'s password, not having met a Gryffindor prefect yet, but help came almost immediately; they heard hurrying feet behind them and turned to see Hermione dashing toward them. \"There you are! Where have you been? The most ridiculous rumors - someone said you\\'d been expelled for crashing a flying car!\" \"Well, we haven\\'t been expelled,\" Harry assured her. \"You\\'re not telling me you did fly here?\" said Hermione, sounding almost as severe as Professor McGonagall. \"Skip the lecture,\" said Ron impatiently, \"and tell us the new password.\" \"It\\'s ‚wattlebird,\\'\" said Hermione impatiently, \"but that\\'s not the point - \" Her words were cut short, however, as the portrait of the fat lady swung open and there was a sudden storm of clapping. It looked as though the whole of Gryffindor House was still awake, packed into the circular common room, standing on the lopsided tables and squashy armchairs, waiting for them to arrive. Arms reached through the portrait hole to pull Harry and Ron inside, leaving Hermione to scramble in after them. \"Brilliant!\" yelled Lee Jordan. \"Inspired! What an entrance! Flying a car right into the Whomping Willow, people\\'ll be talking about that one for years - \" \"Good for you,\" said a fifth year Harry had never spoken to; someone was patting him on the back as though he\\'d just won a marathon; Fred and George pushed their way to the front of the crowd and said together, \"Why couldn\\'t we\\'ve come in the car, eh?\" Ron was scarlet in the face, grinning embarrassedly, but Harry could see one person who didn\\'t look happy at all. Percy was visible over the heads of some excited first years, and he seemed to be trying to get near enough to start telling them off. Harry nudged Ron in the ribs and nodded in Percy\\'s direction. Ron got the point at once. \"Got to get upstairs - bit tired,\" he said, and the two of them started pushing their way toward the door on the other side of the room, which led to a spiral staircase and the dormitories. \"‚Night,\" Harry called back to Hermione, who was wearing a scowl just like Percy\\'s. They managed to get to the other side of the common room, still having their backs slapped, and gained the peace of the staircase. They hurried up it, right to the top, and at last reached the door of their old dormitory, which now had a sign on it saying SECOND YEARS. They entered the familiar, circular room, with its five four-posters hung with red velvet and its high, narrow windows. Their trunks had been brought up for them and stood at the ends of their beds. Ron grinned guiltily at Harry. \"I know I shouldn\\'t\\'ve enjoyed that or anything, but–\" The dormitory door flew open and in came the other second year Gryffindor boys, Seamus Finnigan, Dean Thomas, and Neville Longbottom. \"Unbelievable!\" beamed Seamus. \"Cool,\" said Dean. \"Amazing,\" said Neville, awestruck. Harry couldn\\'t help it. He grinned, too. CHAPTER SIX Gilderoy Lockhart The next day, however, Harry barely grinned once. Things started to go downhill from breakfast in the Great Hall. The four long house tables were laden with tureens of porridge, plates of kippers, mountains of toast, and dishes of eggs and bacon, beneath the enchanted ceiling (today, a dull, cloudy gray). Harry and Ron sat down at the Gryffindor table next to Hermione, who had her copy of Voyages with Vampires propped open against a milk jug. There was a slight stiffness in the way she said \"Morning,\" which told Harry that she was still disapproving of the way they had arrived. Neville Longbottom, on the other hand, greeted them cheerfully. Neville was a round-faced and accident-prone boy with the worst memory of anyone Harry had ever met. \"Mail\\'s due any minute - I think Gran\\'s sending a few things I forgot.\" Harry had only just started his porridge when, sure enough, there was a rushing sound overhead and a hundred or so owls streamed in, circling the hall and dropping letters and packages into the chattering crowd. A big, lumpy package bounced off Neville\\'s head and, a second later, something large and gray fell into Hermione\\'s jug, spraying them all with milk and feathers. \"Errol!\" said Ron, pulling the bedraggled owl out by the feet. Errol slumped, Unconscious, onto the table, his legs in the air and a damp red envelope in his beak. \"Oh, no - \" Ron gasped. \"It\\'s all right, he\\'s still alive,\" said Hermione, prodding Errol gently with the tip of her finger. \"It\\'s not that - it\\'s that.\" Ron was pointing at the red envelope. It looked quite ordinary to Harry, but Ron and Neville were both looking at it as though they expected it to explode. \"What\\'s the matter?\" said Harry. \"She\\'s - she\\'s sent me a Howler,\" said Ron faintly. \"You\\'d better open it, Ron,\" said Neville in a timid whisper. \"It\\'ll be worse if you don\\'t. My gran sent me one once, and I ignored it and\" - he gulped - \"it was horrible.\" Harry looked from their petrified faces to the red envelope. \"What\\'s a Howler?\" he said. But Ron\\'s whole attention was fixed on the letter, which had begun to smoke at the corners. \"Open it,\" Neville urged. \"It\\'ll all be over in a few minutes - \" Ron stretched out a shaking hand, eased the envelope from Errol\\'s beak, and slit it open. Neville stuffed his fingers in his ears. A split second later, Harry knew why. He thought for a moment it had exploded; a roar of sound filled the huge hall, shaking dust from the ceiling. \" - STEALING THE CAR, I WOULDN\\'T HAVE BEEN SURPRISED IF THEY\\'D EXPELLED YOU, YOU WAIT TILL I GET HOLD OF YOU, I DON\\'T SUPPOSE YOU STOPPED TO THINK WHAT YOUR FATHER AND I WENT THROUGH WHEN WE SAW IT WAS GONE - \" Mrs. Weasleys yells, a hundred times louder than usual, made the plates and spoons rattle on the table, and echoed deafeningly off the stone walls. People throughout the hall were swiveling around to see who had received the Howler, and Ron sank so low in his chair that only his crimson forehead could be seen. \" - LETTER FROM DUMBLEDORE LAST NIGHT, I THOUGHT YOUR FATHER WOULD DIE OF SHAME, WE DIDN\\'T BRING YOU UP TO BEHAVE LIKE THIS, YOU AND HARRY COULD BOTH HAVE DIED - \" Harry had been wondering when his name was going to crop up. He tried very hard to look as though he couldn\\'t hear the voice that was making his eardrums throb. \" - ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTED - YOUR FATHER\\'S FACING AN INQUIRY AT WORK, IT\\'S ENTIRELY YOUR FAULT AND IF YOU PUT ANOTHER TOE OUT OF LINE WE\\'LL BRING YOU STRAIGHT BACK HOME.\" A ringing silence fell. The red envelope, which had dropped from Ron\\'s hand, burst into flames and curled into ashes. Harry and Ron sat stunned, as though a tidal wave had just passed over them. A few people laughed and, gradually, a babble of talk broke out again. Hermione closed Voyages with Vampires and looked down at the top of Ron\\'s head. \"Well, I don\\'t know what you expected, Ron, but you - \" \"Don\\'t tell me I deserved it,\" snapped Ron. Harry pushed his porridge away. His insides were burning with guilt. Mr. Weasley was facing an inquiry at work. After all Mr. and Mrs. Weasley had done for him over the summer– But he had no time to dwell on this; Professor McGonagall was moving along the Gryffindor table, handing out course schedules. Harry took his and saw that they had double Herbology with the Hufflepuffs first. Harry, Ron, and Hermione left the castle together, crossed the vegetable patch, and made for the greenhouses, where the magical plants were kept. At least the Howler had done one good thing: Hermione seemed to think they had now been punished enough and was being perfectly friendly again. As they neared the greenhouses they saw the rest of the class standing outside, waiting for Professor Sprout. Harry, Ron, and Hermione had only just joined them when she came striding into view across the lawn, accompanied by Gilderoy Lockhart. Professor Sprout\\'s arms were full of bandages, and with another twinge of guilt, Harry spotted the Whomping Willow in the distance, several of its branches now in slings. Professor Sprout was a squat little witch who wore a patched hat over her flyaway hair; there was usually a large amount of earth on her clothes and her fingernails would have made Aunt Petunia faint. Gilderoy Lockhart, however, was immaculate in sweeping robes of turquoise, his golden hair shining under a perfectly positioned turquoise hat with gold trimming. \"Oh, hello there!\" he called, beaming around at the assembled students. \"Just been showing Professor Sprout the right way to doctor a Whomping Willow! But I don\\'t want you running away with the idea that I\\'m better at Herbology than she is! I just happen to have met several of these exotic plants on my travels–\" \"Greenhouse three today, chaps!\" said Professor Sprout, who was looking distinctly disgruntled, not at all her usual cheerful self. There was a murmur of interest. They had only ever worked in greenhouse one before - greenhouse three housed far more interesting and dangerous plants. Professor Sprout took a large key from her belt and unlocked the door. Harry caught a whiff of damp earth and fertilizer mingling with the heavy perfume of some giant, umbrella-sized flowers dangling from the ceiling. He was about to follow Ron and Hermione inside when Lockhart\\'s hand shot out. \"Harry! I\\'ve been wanting a word - you don\\'t mind if he\\'s a couple of minutes late, do you, Professor Sprout?\" Judging by Professor Sprout\\'s scowl, she did mind, but Lockhart said, \"That\\'s the ticket,\" and closed the greenhouse door in her face. \"Harry,\" said Lockhart, his large white teeth gleaming in the sunlight as he shook his head. \"Harry, Harry, Harry.\" Completely nonplussed, Harry said nothing. \"When I heard - well, of course, it was all my fault. Could have kicked myself.\" Harry had no idea what he was talking about. He was about to say so when Lockhart went on, \"Don\\'t know when I\\'ve been more shocked. Flying a car to Hogwarts! Well, of course, I knew at once why you\\'d done it. Stood out a mile. Harry, Harry, Harry.\" It was remarkable how he could show every one of those brilliant teeth even when he wasn\\'t talking. \"Gave you a taste for publicity, didn\\'t I?\" said Lockhart. \"Gave you the bug. You got onto the front page of the paper with me and you couldn\\'t wait to do it again.\" \"Oh, no, Professor, see - \" \"Harry, Harry, Harry,\" said Lockhart, reaching out and grasping his shoulder. \"I understand. Natural to want a bit more once you\\'ve had that first taste - and I blame myself for giving you that, because it was bound to go to your head - but see here, young man, you can\\'t start flying cars to try and get yourself noticed. Just calm down, all right? Plenty of time for all that when you\\'re older. Yes, yes, I know what you\\'re thinking! ‚It\\'s all right for him, he\\'s an internationally famous wizard already!\\' But when I was twelve, I was just as much of a nobody as you are now. In fact, I\\'d say I was even more of a nobody! I mean, a few people have heard of you, haven\\'t they? All that business with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named!\" He glanced at the lightning scar on Harry\\'s forehead. \"I know, I know - it\\'s not quite as good as winning Witch Weekly\\'s Most Charming Smile Award five times in a row, as I have - but it\\'s a start, Harry, it\\'s a start.\" He gave Harry a hearty wink and strode off. Harry stood stunned for a few seconds, then, remembering he was supposed to be in the greenhouse, he opened the door and slid inside. Professor Sprout was standing behind a trestle bench in the center of the greenhouse. About twenty pairs of different-colored ear muffs were lying on the bench. When Harry had taken his place between Ron and Hermione, she said, \"We\\'ll be repotting Mandrakes today. Now, who can tell me the properties of the Mandrake?\" To nobody\\'s surprise, Hermione\\'s hand was first into the air. \"Mandrake, or Mandragora, is a powerful restorative,\" said Hermione, sounding as usual as though she had swallowed the textbook. \"It is used to return people who have been transfigured or cursed to their original state.\" \"Excellent. Ten points to Gryffindor,\" said Professor Sprout. \"The Mandrake forms an essential part of most antidotes. It is also, however, dangerous. Who can tell me why?\" Hermione\\'s hand narrowly missed Harry\\'s glasses as it shot up again. \"The cry of the Mandrake is fatal to anyone who hears it,\" she said promptly. \"Precisely. Take another ten points,\" said Professor Sprout. \"Now, the Mandrakes we have here are still very young.\" She pointed to a row of deep trays as she spoke, and everyone shuffled forward for a better look. A hundred or so tufty little plants, purplish green in color, were growing there in rows. They looked quite unremarkable to Harry, who didn\\'t have the slightest idea what Hermione meant by the \"cry\" of the Mandrake. \"Everyone take a pair of earmuffs,\" said Professor Sprout. There was a scramble as everyone tried to seize a pair that wasn\\'t pink and fluffy. \"When I tell you to put them on, make sure your ears are completely covered,\" said Professor Sprout. \"When it is safe to remove them, I will give you the thumbs-up. Right - earmuffs on.\" Harry snapped the earmuffs over his ears. They shut out sound completely. Professor Sprout put the pink, fluffy pair over her own ears, rolled up the sleeves of her robes, grasped one of the tufty plants firmly, and pulled hard. Harry let out a gasp of surprise that no one could hear. Instead of roots, a small, muddy, and extremely ugly baby popped out of the earth. The leaves were growing right out of his head. He had pale green, mottled skin, and was clearly bawling at the top of his lungs. Professor Sprout took a large plant pot from under the table and plunged the Mandrake into it, burying him in dark, damp compost until only the tufted leaves were visible. Professor Sprout dusted off her hands, gave them all the thumbs-up, and removed her own earmuffs. \"As our Mandrakes are only seedlings, their cries won\\'t kill yet,\" she said calmly as though she\\'d just done nothing more exciting than water a begonia. \"However, they will knock you out for several hours, and as I\\'m sure none of you want to miss your first day back, make sure your earmuffs are securely in place while you work. I will attract your attention when it is time to pack up. \"Four to a tray - there is a large supply of pots here - compost in the sacks over there - and be careful of the Venemous Tentacula, it\\'s teething.\" She gave a sharp slap to a spiky, dark red plant as she spoke, making it draw in the long feelers that had been inching sneakily over her shoulder. Harry, Ron, and Hermione were joined at their tray by a curly-haired Hufflepuff boy Harry knew by sight but had never spoken to. \"Justin Finch-Fletchley,\" he said brightly, shaking Harry by the hand. \"Know who you are, of course, the famous Harry Potter– And you\\'re Hermione Granger - always top in everything\" (Hermione beamed as she had her hand shaken too) \" - and Ron Weasley. Wasn\\'t that your flying car?\" Ron didn\\'t smile. The Howler was obviously still on his mind. \"That Lockhart\\'s something, isn\\'t he?\" said Justin happily as they began filling their plant pots with dragon dung compost. \"Awfully brave chap. Have you read his books? I\\'d have died of fear if Id been cornered in a telephone booth by a werewolf, but he stayed cool and - zap - just fantastic. \"My name was down for Eton, you know. I can\\'t tell you how glad I am I came here instead. Of course, Mother was slightly disappointed, but since I made her read Lockhart\\'s books I think she\\'s begun to see how useful it\\'ll be to have a fully trained wizard in the family–\" After that they didn\\'t have much chance to talk. Their earmuffs were back on and they needed to concentrate on the Mandrakes. Professor Sprout had made it look extremely easy, but it wasn\\'t. The Mandrakes didn\\'t like coming out of the earth, but didn\\'t seem to want to go back into it either. They squirmed, kicked, flailed their sharp little fists, and gnashed their teeth; Harry spent ten whole minutes trying to squash a particularly fat one into a pot. By the end of the class, Harry, like everyone else, was sweaty, aching, and covered in earth. Everyone traipsed back to the castle for a quick wash and then the Gryffindors hurried off to Transfiguration. Professor McGonagall\\'s classes were always hard work, but today was especially difficult. Everything Harry had learned last year seemed to have leaked out of his head during the summer. He was supposed to be turning a beetle into a button, but all he managed to do was give his beetle a lot of exercise as it scuttled over the desktop avoiding his wand. Ron was having far worse problems. He had patched up his wand with some borrowed Spellotape, but it seemed to be damaged beyond repair. It kept crackling and sparking at odd moments, and every time Ron tried to transfigure his beetle it engulfed him in thick gray smoke that smelled of rotten eggs. Unable to see what he was doing, Ron accidentally squashed his beetle with his elbow and had to ask for a new one. Professor McGonagall wasn\\'t pleased. Harry was relieved to hear the lunch bell. His brain felt like a wrung sponge. Everyone filed out of the classroom except him and Ron, who was whacking his wand furiously on the desk. \"Stupid - useless - thing - \" \"Write home for another one,\" Harry suggested as the wand let off a volley of bangs like a firecracker. \"Oh, yeah, and get another Howler back,\" said Ron, stuffing the now hissing wand into his bag. \"‚It\\'s your own fault your wand got snapped - \\'\" They went down to lunch, where Ron\\'s mood was not improved by Hermione\\'s showing them the handful of perfect coat buttons she had produced in Transfiguration. \"What\\'ve we got this afternoon?\" said Harry, hastily changing the subject. \"Defense Against the Dark Arts,\" said Hermione at once. \"Why,\" demanded Ron, seizing her schedule, \"have you outlined all Lockhart\\'s lessons in little hearts?\" Hermione snatched the schedule back, blushing furiously. They finished lunch and went outside into the overcast courtyard. Hermione sat down on a stone step and buried her nose in Voyages with Vampires again. Harry and Ron stood talking about Quidditch for several minutes before Harry became aware that he was being closely watched. Looking up, he saw the very small, mousy-haired boy he\\'d seen trying on the Sorting Hat last night staring at Harry as though transfixed. He was clutching what looked like an ordinary Muggle camera, and the moment Harry looked at him, he went bright red. \"All right, Harry? I\\'m - I\\'m Colin Creevey,\" he said breathlessly, taking a tentative step forward. \"I\\'m in Gryffindor, too. D\\'you think - would it be all right if - can I have a picture?\" he said, raising the camera hopefully. \"A picture?\" Harry repeated blankly. \"So I can prove I\\'ve met you,\" said Colin Creevey eagerly, edging further forward. \"I know all about you. Everyone\\'s told me. About how you survived when You-Know-Who tried to kill you and how he disappeared and everything and how you\\'ve still got a lightning scar on your forehead\" (his eyes raked Harry\\'s hairline) \"and a boy in my dormitory said if I develop the film in the right potion, the pictures\\'ll move.\" Colin drew a great shuddering breath of excitement and said, \"It\\'s amazing here, isn\\'t it? I never knew all the odd stuff I could do was magic till I got the letter from Hogwarts. My dad\\'s a milkman, he couldn\\'t believe it either. So I\\'m taking loads of pictures to send home to him. And it\\'d be really good if I had one of you\" - he looked imploringly at Harry - \"maybe your friend could take it and I could stand next to you? And then, could you sign it?\" \"Signed photos? You\\'re giving out signed photos, Potter?\" Loud and scathing, Draco Malfoy\\'s voice echoed around the courtyard. He had stopped right behind Colin, flanked, as he always was at Hogwarts, by his large and thuggish cronies, Crabbe and Goyle. \"Everyone line up!\" Malfoy roared to the crowd. \"Harry Potter\\'s giving out signed photos!\" \"No, I\\'m not,\" said Harry angrily, his fists clenching. \"Shut up, Malfoy.\" \"You\\'re just jealous,\" piped up Colin, whose entire body was about as thick as Crabbe\\'s neck. \"Jealous?\" said Malfoy, who didn\\'t need to shout anymore: half the courtyard was listening in. \"Of what? I don\\'t want a foul scar right across my head, thanks. I don\\'t think getting your head cut open makes you that special, myself.\" Crabbe and Goyle were sniggering stupidly. \"Eat slugs, Malfoy,\" said Ron angrily. Crabbe stopped laughing and started rubbing his knuckles in a menacing way. \"Be careful, Weasley,\" sneered Malfoy. \"You don\\'t want to start any trouble or your Mommy\\'ll have to come and take you away from school.\" He put on a shrill, piercing voice. \"‚If you put another toe out of line\\' - \" A knot of Slytherin fifth-years nearby laughed loudly at this. \"Weasley would like a signed photo, Potter,\" smirked Malfoy. \"It\\'d be worth more than his family\\'s whole house - \" Ron whipped out his Spellotaped wand, but Hermione shut Voyages with Vampires with a snap and whispered, \"Look out!\" \"What\\'s all this, what\\'s all this?\" Gilderoy Lockhart was striding toward them, his turquoise robes swirling behind him. \"Who\\'s giving out signed photos?\" Harry started to speak but he was cut short as Lockhart flung an arm around his shoulders and thundered jovially, \"Shouldn\\'t have asked! We meet again, Harry!\" Pinned to Lockhart\\'s side and burning with humiliation, Harry saw Malfoy slide smirking back into the crowd. \"Come on then, Mr. Creevey,\" said Lockhart, beaming at Colin. \"A double portrait, can\\'t do better than that, and we\\'ll both sign it for you.\" Colin fumbled for his camera and took the picture as the bell rang behind them, signaling the start of afternoon classes. \"Off you go, move along there,\" Lockhart called to the crowd, and he set off back to the castle with Harry, who was wishing he knew a good Vanishing Spell, still clasped to his side. \"A word to the wise, Harry,\" said Lockhart paternally as they entered the building through a side door. \"I covered up for you back there with young Creevey - if he was photographing me, too, your schoolmates won\\'t think you\\'re setting yourself up so much–\" Deaf to Harry\\'s stammers, Lockhart swept him down a corridor lined with staring students and up a staircase. \"Let me just say that handing out signed pictures at this stage of your career isn\\'t sensible - looks a tad bigheaded, Harry, to be frank. There may well come a time when, like me, you\\'ll need to keep a stack handy wherever you go, but\" - he gave a little chortle - \"I don\\'t think you\\'re quite there yet.\" They had reached Lockhart\\'s classroom and he let Harry go at last. Harry yanked his robes straight and headed for a seat at the very back of the class, where he busied himself with piling all seven of Lockhart\\'s books in front of him, so that he could avoid looking at the real thing. The rest of the class came clattering in, and Ron and Hermione sat down on either side of Harry. \"You could\\'ve fried an egg on your face\" said Ron. \"You\\'d better hope Creevey doesn\\'t meet Ginny, or they\\'ll be starting a Harry Potter fan club.\" \"Shut up,\" snapped Harry. The last thing he needed was for Lockhart to hear the phrase \"Harry Potter fan club\" When the whole class was seated, Lockhart cleared his throat loudly and silence fell. He reached forward, picked up Neville Longbottom\\'s copy of Travels with Trolls, and held it up to show his own, winking portrait on the front. \"Me,\" he said, pointing at it and winking as well. \"Gilderoy Lockhart, Order of Merlin, Third Class, Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defense League, and five-time winner of Witch Weekly\\'s Most Charming Smile Award but I don\\'t talk about that. I didn\\'t get rid of the Bandon Banshee by smiling at her!\" He waited for them to laugh; a few people smiled weakly. \"I see you\\'ve all bought a complete set of my books - well done. I thought we\\'d start today with a little quiz. Nothing to worry about - just to check how well you\\'ve read them, how much you\\'ve taken in - \" When he had handed out the test papers he returned to the front of the class and said, \"You have thirty minutes - start - now!\" Harry looked down at his paper and read: 1. What is Gilderoy Lockhart\\'s favorite color? 2. What is Gilderoy Lockhart\\'s secret ambition? 3. What, in your opinion, is Gilderoy Lockhart\\'s greatest achievement to date? On and on it went, over three sides of paper, right down to: 54. When is Gilderoy Lockhart\\'s birthday, and what would his ideal gift be? Half an hour later, Lockhart collected the papers and rifled through them in front of the class. \"Tut, tut - hardly any of you remembered that my favorite color is lilac. I say so in Year with the Yeti. And a few of you need to read Wanderings with Werewolves more carefully - I clearly state in chapter twelve that my ideal birthday gift would be harmony between all magic and non-magic peoples - though I wouldn\\'t say no to a large bottle of Ogdeds Old Firewhisky!\" He gave them another roguish wink. Ron was now staring at Lockhart with an expression of disbelief on his face; Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas, who were sitting in front, were shaking with silent laughter. Hermione, on the other hand, was listening to Lockhart with rapt attention and gave a start when he mentioned her name. \"– but Miss Hermione Granger knew my secret ambition is to rid the world of evil and market my own range of hair-care potions - good girl! In fact\" - he flipped her paper over - \"full marks! Where is Miss Hermione Granger?\" Hermione raised a trembling hand. \"Excellent!\" beamed Lockhart. \"Quite excellent! Take ten points for Gryffindor! And so - to business - \" He bent down behind his desk and lifted a large, covered cage onto it. \"Now - be warned! It is my job to arm you against the foulest creatures known to wizardkind! You may find yourselves facing your worst fears in this room. Know only that no harm can befall you whilst I am here. All I ask is that you remain calm.\" In spite of himself, Harry leaned around his pile of books for a better look at the cage. Lockhart placed a hand on the cover. Dean and Seamus had stopped laughing now. Neville was cowering in his front row seat. \"I must ask you not to scream,\" said Lockhart in a low voice. \"It might provoke them.\" As the whole class held its breath, Lockhart whipped off the cover. \"Yes,\" he said dramatically. \"Freshly caught Cornish pixies.\" Seamus Finnigan couldn\\'t control himself. He let out a snort of laughter that even Lockhart couldn\\'t mistake for a scream of terror. \"Yes?\" He smiled at Seamus. \"Well, they\\'re not - they\\'re not very - dangerous, are they?\" Seamus choked. \"Don\\'t be so sure!\" said Lockhart, waggling a finger annoyingly at Seamus. \"Devilish tricky little blighters they can be!\" The pixies were electric blue and about eight inches high, with pointed faces and voices so shrill it was like listening to a lot of budgies arguing. The moment the cover had been removed, they had started jabbering and rocketing around, rattling the bars and making bizarre faces at the people nearest them. \"Right, then,\" Lockhart said loudly. \"Let\\'s see what you make of them!\" And he opened the cage. It was pandemonium. The pixies shot in every direction like rockets. Two of them seized Neville by the ears and lifted him into the air. Several shot straight through the window, showering the back row with broken glass. The rest proceeded to wreck the classroom more effectively than a rampaging rhino. They grabbed ink bottles and sprayed the class with them, shredded books and papers, tore pictures from the walls, up-ended the waste basket, grabbed bags and books and threw them out of the smashed window; within minutes, half the class was sheltering under desks and Neville was swinging from the iron chandelier in the ceiling. \"Come on now - round them up, round them up, they\\'re only pixies,\" Lockhart shouted. He rolled up his sleeves, brandished his wand, and bellowed, \"Peskipiksi Pesternomi!\" It had absolutely no effect; one of the pixies seized his wand and threw it out of the window, too. Lockhart gulped and dived under his own desk, narrowly avoiding being squashed by Neville, who fell a second later as the chandelier gave way. The bell rang and there was a mad rush toward the exit. In the relative calm that followed, Lockhart straightened up, caught sight of Harry, Ron, and Hermione, who were almost at the door, and said, \"Well, I\\'ll ask you three to just nip the rest of them back into their cage.\" He swept past them and shut the door quickly behind him. \"Can you believe him?\" roared Ron as one of the remaining pixies bit him painfully on the ear. \"He just wants to give us some hands-on experience,\" said Hermione, immobilizing two pixies at once with a clever Freezing Charm and stuffing them back into their cage. \"Hands on? \"said Harry, who was trying to grab a pixie dancing out of reach with its tongue out. \"Hermione, he didn\\'t have a clue what he was doing - \" \"Rubbish,\" said Hermione. \"You\\'ve read his books - look at all those amazing things he\\'s done - \" \"He says he\\'s done,\" Ron muttered. CHAPTER SEVEN Mudbloods and Murmurs Harry spent a lot of time over the next few days dodging out of sight whenever he saw Gilderoy Lockhart coming down a corridor. Harder to avoid was Colin Creevey, who seemed to have memorized Harry\\'s schedule. Nothing seemed to give Colin a bigger thrill than to say, \"All right, Harry?\" six or seven times a day and hear, \"Hello, Colin,\" back, however exasperated Harry sounded when he said it. Hedwig was still angry with Harry about the disastrous car journey and Ron\\'s wand was still malfunctioning, surpassing itself on Friday morning by shooting out of Ron\\'s hand in Charms and hitting tiny old Professor Flitwick squarely between the eyes, creating a large, throbbing green boil where it had struck. So with one thing and another, Harry was quite glad to reach the weekend. He, Ron, and Hermione were planning to visit Hagrid on Saturday morning. Harry, however, was shaken awake several hours earlier than he would have liked by Oliver Wood, Captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team. \"Whassamatter?\" said Harry groggily. \"Quidditch practice!\" said Wood. \"Come on!\" Harry squinted at the window. There was a thin mist hanging across the pink-and-gold sky. Now that he was awake, he couldn\\'t understand how he could have slept through the racket the birds were making. \"Oliver,\" Harry croaked. \"It\\'s the crack of dawn.\" \"Exactly,\" said Wood. He was a tall and burly sixth year and, at the moment, his eyes were gleaming with a crazed enthusiasm. \"It\\'s part of our new training program. Come on, grab your broom, and let\\'s go,\" said Wood heartily. \"None of the other teams have started training yet; we\\'re going to be first off the mark this year - \" Yawning and shivering slightly, Harry climbed out of bed and tried to find his Quidditch robes. \"Good man,\" said Wood. \"Meet you on the field in fifteen minutes.\" When he\\'d found his scarlet team robes and pulled on his cloak for warmth, Harry scribbled a note to Ron explaining where he\\'d gone and went down the spiral staircase to the common room, his Nimbus Two Thousand on his shoulder. He had just reached the portrait hole when there was a clatter behind him and Colin Creevey came dashing down the spiral staircase, his camera swinging madly around his neck and something clutched in his hand. \"I heard someone saying your name on the stairs, Harry! Look what I\\'ve got here! I\\'ve had it developed, I wanted to show you - \" Harry looked bemusedly at the photograph Colin was brandishing under his nose. A moving, black-and-white Lockhart was tugging hard on an arm Harry recognized as his own. He was pleased to see that his photographic self was putting up a good fight and refusing to be dragged into view. As Harry watched, Lockhart gave up and slumped, Panting, against the white edge of the picture. \"Will you sign it?\" said Colin eagerly. \"No,\" said Harry flatly, glancing around to check that the room was really deserted. \"Sorry, Colin, I\\'m in a hurry - Quidditch practice - \" He climbed through the portrait hole. \"Oh, wow! Wait for me! I\\'ve never watched a Quidditch game before!\" Colin scrambled through the hole after him. \"It\\'ll be really boring,\" Harry said quickly, but Colin ignored him, his face shining with excitement. \"You were the youngest House player in a hundred years, weren\\'t you, Harry? Weren\\'t you?\" said Colin, trotting alongside him. \"You must be brilliant. I\\'ve never flown. Is it easy? Is that your own broom? Is that the best one there is?\" Harry didn\\'t know how to get rid of him. It was like having an extremely talkative shadow. \"I don\\'t really understand Quidditch,\" said Colin breathlessly. \"Is it true there are four balls? And two of them fly around trying to knock people off their brooms?\" \"Yes,\" said Harry heavily, resigned to explaining the complicated rules of Quidditch. \"They\\'re called Bludgers. There are two Beaters on each team who carry clubs to beat the Bludgers away from their side. Fred and George Weasley are the Gryffindor Beaters.\" \"And what are the other balls for?\" Colin asked, tripping down a couple of steps because he was gazing open-mouthed at Harry. \"Well, the Quaffle - that\\'s the biggish red one - is the one that scores goals. Three Chasers on each team throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through the goal posts at the end of the pitch - they\\'re three long poles with hoops on the end.\" \"And the fourth ball - \" \" - is the Golden Snitch,\" said Harry, \"and it\\'s very small, very fast, and difficult to catch. But that\\'s what the Seeker\\'s got to do, because a game of Quidditch doesn\\'t end until the Snitch has been caught. And whichever team\\'s Seeker gets the Snitch earns his team an extra hundred and fifty points.\" \"And you\\'re the Gryffindor Seeker, aren\\'t you?\" said Colin in awe. \"Yes,\" said Harry as they left the castle and started across the dew-drenched grass. \"And there\\'s the Keeper, too. He guards the goal posts. That\\'s it, really.\" But Colin didn\\'t stop questioning Harry all the way down the sloping lawns to the Quidditch field, and Harry only shook him off when he reached the changing rooms; Colin called after him in a piping voice, \"I\\'ll go and get a good seat, Harry!\" and hurried off to the stands. The rest of the Gryffindor team were already in the changing room. Wood was the only person who looked truly awake. Fred and George Weasley were sitting, puffy-eyed and touslehaired, next to fourth year Alicia Spinnet, who seemed to be nodding off against the wall behind her. Her fellow Chasers, Katie Bell and Angelina Johnson, were yawning side by side opposite them. \"There you are, Harry, what kept you?\" said Wood briskly. \"Now, I wanted a quick talk with you all before we actually get onto the field, because I spent the summer devising a whole new training program, which I really think will make all the difference–\" Wood was holding up a large diagram of a Quidditch field, on which were drawn many lines, arrows, and crosses in different colored inks. He took out his wand, tapped the board, and the arrows began to wiggle over the diagram like caterpillars. As Wood launched into a speech about his new tactics, Fred Weasley\\'s head drooped right onto Alicia Spinnet\\'s shoulder and he began to snore. The first board took nearly twenty minutes to explain, but there was another board under that, and a third under that one. Harry sank into a stupor as Wood droned on and on. \"So,\" said Wood, at long last, jerking Harry from a wistful fantasy about what he could be eating for breakfast at this very moment up at the castle. \"Is that clear? Any questions?\" \"I\\'ve got a question, Oliver,\" said George, who had woken with a start. \"Why couldn\\'t you have told us all this yesterday when we were awake?\" Wood wasn\\'t pleased. \"Now, listen here, you lot,\" he said, glowering at them all. \"We should have won the Quidditch cup last year. We\\'re easily the best team. But unfortunately - owing to circumstances beyond our control - \" Harry shifted guiltily in his seat. He had been unconscious in the hospital wing for the final match of the previous year, meaning that Gryffindor had been a player short and had suffered their worst defeat in three hundred years. Wood took a moment to regain control of himself. Their last defeat was clearly still torturing him. \"So this year, we train harder than ever before– Okay, let\\'s go and put our new theories into practice!\" Wood shouted, seizing his broomstick and leading the way out of the locker rooms. Stiff-legged and still yawning, his team followed. They had been in the locker room so long that the sun was up completely now, although remnants of mist hung over the grass in the stadium. As Harry walked onto the field, he saw Ron and Hermione sitting in the stands. \"Aren\\'t you finished yet?\" called Ron incredulously. \"Haven\\'t even started,\" said Harry, looking jealously at the toast and marmalade Ron and Hermione had brought out of the Great Hall. \"Wood\\'s been teaching us new moves.\" He mounted his broomstick and kicked at the ground, soaring up into the air. The cool morning air whipped his face, waking him far more effectively than Wood\\'s long talk. It felt wonderful to be back on the Quidditch field. He soared right around the stadium at full speed, racing Fred and George. \"What\\'s that funny clicking noise?\" called Fred as they hurtled around the corner. Harry looked into the stands. Colin was sitting in one of the highest seats, his camera raised, taking picture after picture, the sound strangely magnified in the deserted stadium. \"Look this way, Harry! This way!\" he cried shrilly. \"Who\\'s that?\" said Fred. \"No idea,\" Harry lied, putting on a spurt of speed that took him as far away as possible from Colin. \"What\\'s going on?\" said Wood, frowning, as he skimmed through the air toward them. \"Why\\'s that first year taking pictures? I don\\'t like it. He could be a Slytherin spy, trying to find out about our new training program.\" \"He\\'s in Gryffindor,\" said Harry quickly. \"And the Slytherins don\\'t need a spy, Oliver,\" said George. \"What makes you say that?\" said Wood testily. \"Because they\\'re here in person,\" said George, pointing. Several people in green robes were walking onto the field, broomsticks in their hands. \"I don\\'t believe it!\" Wood hissed in outrage. \"I booked the field for today! We\\'ll see about this!\" Wood shot toward the ground, landing rather harder than he meant to in his anger, staggering slightly as he dismounted. Harry, Fred, and George followed. \"Flint!\" Wood bellowed at the Slytherin Captain. \"This is our practice time! We got up specially! You can clear off now!\" Marcus Flint was even larger than Wood. He had a look of trollish cunning on his face as he replied, \"Plenty of room for all of us, Wood.\" Angelina, Alicia, and Katie had come over, too. There were no girls on the Slytherin team, who stood shoulder to shoulder, facing the Gryffindors, leering to a man. \"But I booked the field!\" said Wood, positively spitting with rage. \"I booked it!\" \"Ah,\" said Flint. \"But I\\'ve got a specially signed note here from Professor Snape. ‚I, Professor S. Snape, give the Slytherin team permission to practice today on the Quidditch field owing to the need to train their new Seeker\\'. \" \"You\\'ve got a new Seeker?\" said Wood, distracted. \"Where?\" And from behind the six large figures before them came a seventh, smaller boy, smirking all over his pale, pointed face. It was Draco Malfoy. \"Aren\\'t you Lucius Malfoy\\'s son?\" said Fred, looking at Malfoy with dislike. \"Funny you should mention Draco\\'s father,\" said Flint as the whole Slytherin team smiled still more broadly. \"Let me show you the generous gift he\\'s made to the Slytherin team.\" All seven of them held out their broomsticks. Seven highly polished, brand-new handles and seven sets of fine gold lettering spelling the words Nimbus Two Thousand and One gleamed under the Gryffindors\\' noses in the early morning sun. \"Very latest model. Only came out last month,\" said Flint carelessly, flicking a speck of dust from the end of his own. \"I believe it outstrips the old Two Thousand series by a considerable amount. As for the old Cleansweeps\" - he smiled nastily at Fred and George, who were both clutching Cleansweep Fives - \" sweeps the board with them.\" None of the Gryffindor team could think of anything to say for a moment. Malfoy was smirking so broadly his cold eyes were reduced to slits. \"Oh, look,\" said Flint. \"A field invasion.\" Ron and Hermione were crossing the grass to see what was going on. \"What\\'s happening?\" Ron asked Harry. \"Why aren\\'t you playing? And what\\'s he doing here?\" He was looking at Malfoy, taking in his Slytherin Quidditch robes. \"I\\'m the new Slytherin Seeker, Weasley,\" said Malfoy, smugly. \"Everyone\\'s just been admiring the brooms my father\\'s bought our team. Ron gaped, open-mouthed, at the seven superb broomsticks in front of him. \"Good, aren\\'t they?\" said Malfoy smoothly. \"But perhaps the Gryffindor team will be able to raise some gold and get new brooms, too. You could raffle off those Cleansweep Fives; I expect a museum would bid for them.\" The Slytherin team howled with laughter. \"At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in,\" said Hermione sharply. \"They got in on pure talent.\" The smug look on Malfoy\\'s face flickered. \"No one asked your opinion, you filthy little Mudblood,\" he spat. Harry knew at once that Malfoy had said something really bad because there was an instant uproar at his words. Flint had to dive in front of Malfoy to stop Fred and George jumping on him, Alicia shrieked, \"How dare you!\" and Ron plunged his hand into his robes, pulled out his wand, yelling, \"You\\'ll pay for that one, Malfoy!\" and pointed it furiously under Flint\\'s arm at Malfoys face. A loud bang echoed around the stadium and a jet of green light shot out of the wrong end of Ron\\'s wand, hitting him in the stomach and sending him reeling backward onto the grass. \"Ron! Ron! Are you all right?\" squealed Hermione. Ron opened his mouth to speak, but no words came out. Instead he gave an almighty belch and several slugs dribbled out of his mouth onto his lap. The Slytherin team were paralyzed with laughter. Flint was doubled up, hanging onto his new broomstick for support. Malfoy was on all fours, banging the ground with his fist. The Gryffindors were gathered around Ron, who kept belching large, glistening slugs. Nobody seemed to want to touch him. \"We\\'d better get him to Hagrid\\'s, it\\'s nearest,\" said Harry to Hermione, who nodded bravely, and the pair of them pulled Ron up by the arms. \"What happened, Harry? What happened? Is he ill? But you can cure him, can\\'t you?\" Colin had run down from his seat and was now dancing alongside them as they left the field. Ron gave a huge heave and more slugs dribbled down his front. \"Oooh,\" said Colin, fascinated and raising his camera. \"Can you hold him still, Harry?\" \"Get out of the way, Colin!\" said Harry angrily. He and Hermione supported Ron out of the stadium and across the grounds toward the edge of the forest. \"Nearly there, Ron,\" said Hermione as the gamekeeper\\'s cabin came into view. \"You\\'ll be all right in a minute - almost there - \" They were within twenty feet of Hagrid\\'s house when the front door opened, but it wasn\\'t Hagrid who emerged. Gilderoy Lockhart, wearing robes of palest mauve today, came striding out. \"Quick, behind here,\" Harry hissed, dragging Ron behind a nearby bush. Hermione followed, somewhat reluctantly. \"It\\'s a simple matter if you know what you\\'re doing!\" Lockhart was saying loudly to Hagrid. \"If you need help, you know where I am! I\\'ll let you have a copy of my book. I\\'m surprised you haven\\'t already got one - I\\'ll sign one tonight and send it over. Well, good-bye!\" And he strode away toward the castle. Harry waited until Lockhart was out of sight, then pulled Ron out of the bush and up to Hagrid\\'s front door. They knocked urgently. Hagrid appeared at once, looking very grumpy, but his expression brightened when he saw who it was. \"Bin wonderin\\' when you\\'d come ter see me - come in, come in - thought you mighta bin Professor Lockhart back again - \" Harry and Hermione supported Ron over the threshold into the one-roomed cabin, which had an enormous bed in one corner, a fire crackling merrily in the other. Hagrid didn\\'t seem perturbed by Ron\\'s slug problem, which Harry hastily explained as he lowered Ron into a chair. \"Better out than in,\" he said cheerfully, plunking a large copper basin in front of him. \"Get ‚em all up, Ron.\" \"I don\\'t think there\\'s anything to do except wait for it to stop,\" said Hermione anxiously, watching Ron bend over the basin. \"That\\'s a difficult curse to work at the best of times, but with a broken wand - \" Hagrid was bustling around making them tea. His boarhound, Fang, was slobbering over Harry. \"What did Lockhart want with you, Hagrid?\" Harry asked, scratching Fang\\'s ears. \"Givin\\' me advice on gettin\\' kelpies out of a well,\" growled Hagrid, moving a half-plucked rooster off his scrubbed table and setting down the teapot. \"Like I don\\' know. An\\' bangin\\' on about some banshee he banished. If one word of it was true, I\\'ll eat my kettle.\" It was most unlike Hagrid to criticize a Hogwarts\\' teacher, and Harry looked at him in surprise. Hermione, however, said in a voice somewhat higher than usual, \"I think you\\'re being a bit unfair. Professor Dumbledore obviously thought he was the best man for the job - \" \"He was the on\\'y man for the job,\" said Hagrid, offering them a plate of treacle fudge, while Ron coughed squelchily into his basin. \"An\\' I mean the on\\'y one. Gettin\\' very difficult ter find anyone fer the Dark Arts job. People aren\\'t too keen ter take it on, see. They\\'re startin\\' ter think it\\'s jinxed. No one\\'s lasted long fer a while now. So tell me,\" said Hagrid, jerking his head at Ron. \"Who was he tryin\\' ter curse?\" \"Malfoy called Hermione something - it must\\'ve been really bad, because everyone went wild.\" \"It was bad,\" said Ron hoarsely, emerging over the tabletop looking pale and sweaty. \"Malfoy called her ‚Mudblood,\\' Hagrid - \" Ron dived out of sight again as a fresh wave of slugs made their appearance. Hagrid looked outraged. \"He didn\\'!\" he growled at Hermione. \"He did,\" she said. \"But I don\\'t know what it means. I could tell it was really rude, of course - \" \"It\\'s about the most insulting thing he could think of,\" gasped Ron, coming back up. \"Mudblood\\'s a really foul name for someone who is Muggle-born - you know, non-magic parents. There are some wizards - like Malfoy\\'s family - who think they\\'re better than everyone else because they\\'re what people call pure-blood.\" He gave a small burp, and a single slug fell into his outstretched hand. He threw it into the basin and continued, \"I mean, the rest of us know it doesn\\'t make any difference at all. Look at Neville Longbottom - he\\'s pure-blood and he can hardly stand a cauldron the right way up.\" \"An\\' they haven\\'t invented a spell our Hermione can\\' do,\" said Hagrid proudly, making Hermione go a brilliant shade of magenta. \"It\\'s a disgusting thing to call someone,\" said Ron, wiping his sweaty brow with a shaking hand. \"Dirty blood, see. Common blood. It\\'s ridiculous. Most wizards these days are half-blood anyway. If we hadn\\'t married Muggles we\\'d\\'ve died out.\" He retched and ducked out of sight again. \"Well, I don\\' blame yeh fer tryin\\' ter curse him, Ron,\" said Hagrid loudly over the thuds of more slugs hitting the basin. \"Bu\\' maybe it was a good thing yer wand backfired. \\'Spect Lucius Malfoy would\\'ve come marchin\\' up ter school if yeh\\'d cursed his son. Least yer not in trouble.\" Harry would have pointed out that trouble didn\\'t come much worse than having slugs pouring out of your mouth, but he couldn\\'t; Hagrid\\'s treacle fudge had cemented his jaws together. \"Harry,\" said Hagrid abruptly as though struck by a sudden thought. \"Gotta bone ter pick with yeh. I\\'ve heard you\\'ve bin givin\\' out signed photos. How come I haven\\'t got one?\" Furious, Harry wrenched his teeth apart. \"I have not been giving out signed photos,\" he said hotly. \"If Lockhart\\'s still spreading that around - \" But then he saw that Hagrid was laughing. \"I\\'m on\\'y jokin\\',\" he said, patting Harry genially on the back and sending him face first into the table. \"I knew yeh hadn\\'t really. I told Lockhart yeh didn\\' need teh. Yer more famous than him without tryin\\'.\" \"Bet he didn\\'t like that,\" said Harry, sitting up and rubbing his chin. \"Don\\' think he did,\" said Hagrid, his eyes twinkling. \"An\\' then I told him I\\'d never read one o\\' his books an\\' he decided ter go. Treacle fudge, Ron?\" he added as Ron reappeared. \"No thanks,\" said Ron weakly. \"Better not risk it.\" \"Come an\\' see what I\\'ve bin growin\\',\" said Hagrid as Harry and Hermione finished the last of their tea. In the small vegetable patch behind Hagrid\\'s house were a dozen of the largest pumpkins Harry had ever seen. Each was the size of a large boulder. \"Gettin\\' on well, aren\\'t they?\" said Hagrid happily. \"Fer the Halloween feast– should be big enough by then.\" \"What\\'ve you been feeding them?\" said Harry. Hagrid looked over his shoulder to check that they were alone. \"Well, I\\'ve bin givin\\' them - you know - a bit o\\' help - \" Harry noticed Hagrid\\'s flowery pink umbrella leaning against the back wall of the cabin. Harry had had reason to believe before now that this umbrella was not all it looked; in fact, he had the strong impression that Hagrid\\'s old school wand was concealed inside it. Hagrid wasn\\'t supposed to use magic. He had been expelled from Hogwarts in his third year, but Harry had never found out why - any mention of the matter and Hagrid would clear his throat loudly and become mysteriously deaf until the subject was changed. \"An Engorgement Charm, I suppose?\" said Hermione, halfway between disapproval and amusement. \"Well, you\\'ve done a good job on them.\" \"That\\'s what yer little sister said,\" said Hagrid, nodding at Ron. \"Met her jus\\' yesterday.\" Hagrid looked sideways at Harry, his beard twitching. \"Said she was jus\\' lookin\\' round the grounds, but I reckon she was hopin\\' she might run inter someone else at my house.\" He winked at Harry. \"If yeh ask me, she wouldn\\' say no ter a signed - \" \"Oh, shut up,\" said Harry. Ron snorted with laughter and the ground was sprayed with slugs. \"Watch it!\" Hagrid roared, pulling Ron away from his precious pumpkins. It was nearly lunchtime and as Harry had only had one bit of treacle fudge since dawn, he was keen to go back to school to eat. They said good-bye to Hagrid and walked back up to the castle, Ron hiccoughing occasionally, but only bringing up two very small slugs. They had barely set foot in the cool entrance hall when a voice rang out, \"There you are, Potter - Weasley.\" Professor McGonagall was walking toward them, looking stern. \"You will both do your detentions this evening.\" \"What\\'re we doing, Professor?\" said Ron, nervously suppressing a burp. \"You will be polishing the silver in the trophy room with Mr. Filch,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"And no magic, Weasley - elbow grease.\" Ron gulped. Argus Filch, the caretaker, was loathed by every student in the school. \"And you, Potter, will be helping Professor Lockhart answer his fan mail,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"Oh n - Professor, can\\'t I go and do the trophy room, too?\" said Harry desperately. \"Certainly not,\" said Professor McGonagall, raising her eyebrows. \"Professor Lockhart requested you particularly. Eight o\\'clock sharp, both of you.\" Harry and Ron slouched into the Great Hall in states of deepest gloom, Hermione behind them, wearing a well-you-did-break-school-rules sort of expression. Harry didn\\'t enjoy his shepherd\\'s pie as much as he\\'d thought. Both he and Ron felt they\\'d got the worse deal. \"Filch\\'ll have me there all night,\" said Ron heavily. \"No magic! There must be about a hundred cups in that room. I\\'m no good at Muggle cleaning.\" \"I\\'d swap anytime,\" said Harry hollowly. \"I\\'ve had loads of practice with the Dursleys. Answering Lockhart\\'s fan mail– he\\'ll be a nightmare–\" Saturday afternoon seemed to melt away, and in what seemed like no time, it was five minutes to eight, and Harry was dragging his feet along the second-floor corridor to Lockhart\\'s office. He gritted his teeth and knocked. The door flew open at once. Lockhart beamed down at him. \"Ah, here\\'s the scalawag!\" he said. \"Come in, Harry, come in - \" Shining brightly on the walls by the light of many candles were countless framed photographs of Lockhart. He had even signed a few of them. Another large pile lay on his desk. \"You can address the envelopes!\" Lockhart told Harry, as though this was a huge treat. \"This first one\\'s to Gladys Gudgeon, bless her - huge fan of mine - \" The minutes snailed by. Harry let Lockhart\\'s voice wash over him, occasionally saying, \"Mmm\" and \"Right\" and \"Yeah.\" Now and then he caught a phrase like, \"Fame\\'s a fickle friend, Harry,\" or \"Celebrity is as celebrity does, remember that.\" The candles burned lower and lower, making the light dance over the many moving faces of Lockhart watching him. Harry moved his aching hand over what felt like the thousandth envelope, writing out Veronica Smethley\\'s address. It must be nearly time to leave, Harry thought miserably, please let it be nearly time– And then he heard something - something quite apart from the spitting of the dying candles and Lockhart\\'s prattle about his fans. It was a voice, a voice to chill the bone marrow, a voice of breathtaking, ice-cold venom. \"Come– come to me– Let me rip you.. .Let me tear you.. .Let me kill you–\" Harry gave a huge jump and a large lilac blot appeared on Veronica Smethley\\'s street. \"What?\" he said loudly. \"I know!\" said Lockhart. \"Six solid months at the top of the best-seller list! Broke all records!\" \"No,\" said Harry frantically. \"That voice!\" \"Sorry?\" said Lockhart, looking puzzled. \"What voice?\" \"That - that voice that said - didn\\'t you hear it?\" Lockhart was looking at Harry in high astonishment. \"What are you talking about, Harry? Perhaps you\\'re getting a little drowsy? Great Scott - look at the time! We\\'ve been here nearly four hours! I\\'d never have believed it - the time\\'s flown, hasn\\'t it?\" Harry didn\\'t answer. He was straining his ears to hear the voice again, but there was no sound now except for Lockhart telling him he mustn\\'t expect a treat like this every time he got detention. Feeling dazed, Harry left. It was so late that the Gryffindor common room was almost empty. Harry went straight up to the dormitory. Ron wasn\\'t back yet. Harry pulled on his pajamas, got into bed, and waited. Half an hour later, Ron arrived, nursing his right arm and bringing a strong smell of polish into the darkened room. \"My muscles have all seized up,\" he groaned, sinking on his bed. \"Fourteen times he made me buff up that Quidditch cup before he was satisfied. And then I had another slug attack all over a Special Award for Services to the School. Took ages to get the slime off– How was it with Lockhart?\" Keeping his voice low so as not to wake Neville, Dean, and Seamus, Harry told Ron exactly what he had heard. \"And Lockhart said he couldn\\'t hear it?\" said Ron. Harry could see him frowning in the moonlight. \"D\\'you think he was lying? But I don\\'t get it - even someone invisible would\\'ve had to open the door.\" \"I know,\" said Harry, lying back in his four-poster and staring at the canopy above him. \"I don\\'t get it either.\" CHAPTER EIGHT The Deathday Party October arrived, spreading a damp chill over the grounds and into the castle. Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, was kept busy by a sudden spate of colds among the staff and students. Her Pepperup potion worked instantly, though it left the drinker smoking at the ears for several hours afterward. Ginny Weasley, who had been looking pale, was bullied into taking some by Percy. The steam pouring from under her vivid hair gave the impression that her whole head was on fire. Raindrops the size of bullets thundered on the castle windows for days on end; the lake rose, the flower beds turned into muddy streams, and Hagrid\\'s pumpkins swelled to the size of garden sheds. Oliver Wood\\'s enthusiasm for regular training sessions, however, was not dampened, which was why Harry was to be found, late one stormy Saturday afternoon a few days before Halloween, returning to Gryffindor Tower, drenched to the skin and splattered with mud. Even aside from the rain and wind it hadn\\'t been a happy practice session. Fred and George, who had been spying on the Slytherin team, had seen for themselves the speed of those new Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones. They reported that the Slytherin team was no more than seven greenish blurs, shooting through the air like missiles. As Harry squelched along the deserted corridor he came across somebody who looked just as preoccupied as he was. Nearly Headless Nick, the ghost of Gryffindor Tower, was staring morosely out of a window, muttering under his breath, \"– don\\'t fulfill their requirements– half an inch, if that–\" \"Hello, Nick,\" said Harry. \"Hello, hello,\" said Nearly Headless Nick, starting and looking round. He wore a dashing, plumed hat on his long curly hair, and a tunic with a ruff, which concealed the fact that his neck was almost completely severed. He was pale as smoke, and Harry could see right through him to the dark sky and torrential rain outside. \"You look troubled, young Potter,\" said Nick, folding a transparent letter as he spoke and tucking it inside his doublet. \"So do you,\" said Harry. \"Ah,\" Nearly Headless Nick waved an elegant hand, \"a matter of no importance– It\\'s not as though I really wanted to join– Thought I\\'d apply, but apparently I ‚don\\'t fulfill requirements\\' - \" In spite of his airy tone, there was a look of great bitterness on his face. \"But you would think, wouldn\\'t you,\" he erupted suddenly, pulling the letter back out of his pocket, \"that getting hit forty-five times in the neck with a blunt axe would qualify you to join the Headless Hunt?\" \"Oh - yes,\" said Harry, who was obviously supposed to agree. \"I mean, nobody wishes more than I do that it had all been quick and clean, and my head had come off properly, I mean, it would have saved me a great deal of pain and ridicule. However - \" Nearly Headless Nick shook his letter open and read furiously: \"‚We can only accept huntsmen whose heads have parted company with their bodies. You will appreciate that it would be impossible otherwise for members to participate in hunt activities such as Horseback Head-Juggling and Head Polo. It is with the greatest regret, therefore, that I must inform you that you do not fulfill our requirements. With very best wishes, Sir Patrick Delaney-Podmore.\\'\" Fuming, Nearly Headless Nick stuffed the letter away. \"Half an inch of skin and sinew holding my neck on, Harry! Most people would think that\\'s good and beheaded, but oh, no, it\\'s not enough for Sir Properly Decapitated-Podmore.\" Nearly Headless Nick took several deep breaths and then said, in a far calmer tone, \"So - what\\'s bothering you? Anything I can do?\" \"No,\" said Harry. \"Not unless you know where we can get seven free Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones for our match against Sly - \" The rest of Harry\\'s sentence was drowned out by a high-pitched mewling from somewhere near his ankles. He looked down and found himself gazing into a pair of lamp-like yellow eyes. It was Mrs. Norris, the skeletal gray cat who was used by the caretaker, Argus Filch, as a sort of deputy in his endless battle against students. \"You\\'d better get out of here, Harry,\" said Nick quickly. \"Filch isn\\'t in a good mood - he\\'s got the flu and some third years accidentally plastered frog brains all over the ceiling in dungeon five. He\\'s been cleaning all morning, and if he sees you dripping mud all over the place - \" \"Right,\" said Harry, backing away from the accusing stare of Mrs. Norris, but not quickly enough. Drawn to the spot by the mysterious power that seemed to connect him with his foul cat, Argus Filch burst suddenly through a tapestry to Harry\\'s right, wheezing and looking wildly about for the rule-breaker. There was a thick tartan scarf bound around his head, and his nose was unusually purple. \"Filth!\" he shouted, his jowls aquiver, his eyes popping alarmingly as he pointed at the muddy puddle that had dripped from Harry\\'s Quidditch robes. \"Mess and muck everywhere! I\\'ve had enough of it, I tell you! Follow me, Potter!\" So Harry waved a gloomy good-bye to Nearly Headless Nick and followed Filch back downstairs, doubling the number of muddy footprints on the floor. Harry had never been inside Filch\\'s office before; it was a place most students avoided. The room was dingy and windowless, lit by a single oil lamp dangling from the low ceiling. A faint smell of fried fish lingered about the place. Wooden filing cabinets stood around the walls; from their labels, Harry could see that they contained details of every pupil Filch had ever punished. Fred and George Weasley had an entire drawer to themselves. A highly polished collection of chains and manacles hung on the wall behind Filch\\'s desk. It was common knowledge that he was always begging Dumbledore to let him suspend students by their ankles from the ceiling. Filch grabbed a quill from a pot on his desk and began shuffling around looking for parchment. \"Dung,\" he muttered furiously, \"great sizzling dragon bogies– frog brains– rat intestines– I\\'ve had enough of it– make an example– where\\'s the form– yes–\" He retrieved a large roll of parchment from his desk drawer and stretched it out in front of him, dipping his long black quill into the ink pot. \"Name– Harry Potter. Crime–\" \"It was only a bit of mud!\" said Harry. \"It\\'s only a bit of mud to you, boy, but to me it\\'s an extra hour scrubbing!\" shouted Filch, a drip shivering unpleasantly at the end of his bulbous nose. \"Crime– befouling the castle– suggested sentence–\" Dabbing at his streaming nose, Filch squinted unpleasantly at Harry who waited with bated breath for his sentence to fall. But as Filch lowered his quill, there was a great BANG! on the ceiling of the office, which made the oil lamp rattle. \"PEEVES!\" Filch roared, flinging down his quill in a transport of rage. \"I\\'ll have you this time, I\\'ll have you!\" And without a backward glance at Harry, Filch ran flat-footed from the office, Mrs. Norris streaking alongside him. Peeves was the school poltergeist, a grinning, airborne menace who lived to cause havoc and distress. Harry didn\\'t much like Peeves, but couldn\\'t help feeling grateful for his timing. Hopefully, whatever Peeves had done (and it sounded as though he\\'d wrecked something very big this time) would distract Filch from Harry. Thinking that he should probably wait for Filch to come back, Harry sank into a moth-eaten chair next to the desk. There was only one thing on it apart from his half-completed form: a large, glossy, purple envelope with silver lettering on the front. With a quick glance at the door to check that Filch wasn\\'t on his way back, Harry picked up the envelope and read: Kwikspell A Correspondence Course in Beginners\\' Magic. Intrigued, Harry flicked the envelope open and pulled out the sheaf of parchment inside. More curly silver writing on the front page said: Feel out of step in the world of modern magic? Find yourself making excuses not to perform simple spells? Ever been taunted for your woeful wandwork? There is an answer! Kwikspell is an all-new, fail-safe, quick-result, easy-learn course. Hundreds of witches and wizards have benefited from the Kwikspell method! Madam Z. Nettles of Topsham writes: \"I had no memory for incantations and my potions were a family joke! Now, after a Kwikspell course, I am the center of attention at parties and friends beg for the recipe of my Scintillation Solution!\" Warlock D. J. Prod of Didsbury says: \"My wife used to sneer at my feeble charms, but one month into your fabulous Kwikspell course and I succeeded in turning her into a yak! Thank you, Kwikspell!\" Fascinated, Harry thumbed through the rest of the envelope\\'s contents. Why on earth did Filch want a Kwikspell course? Did this mean he wasn\\'t a proper wizard? Harry was just reading Lesson One: Holding Your Wand (Some Useful Tips) when shuffling footsteps outside told him Filch was coming back. Stuffing the parchment back into the envelope, Harry threw it back onto the desk just as the door opened. Filch was looking triumphant. \"That vanishing cabinet was extremely valuable!\" he was saying gleefully to Mrs. Norris. \"We\\'ll have Peeves out this time, my sweet - \" His eyes fell on Harry and then darted to the Kwikspell envelope, which, Harry realized too late, was lying two feet away from where it had started. Filch\\'s pasty face went brick red. Harry braced himself for a tidal wave of fury. Filch hobbled across to his desk, snatched up the envelope, and threw it into a drawer. \"Have you - did you read - ?\" he sputtered. \"No,\" Harry lied quickly. Filch\\'s knobbly hands were twisting together. \"If I thought you\\'d read my private - not that it\\'s mine - for a friend - be that as it may - however - \" Harry was staring at him, alarmed; Filch had never looked madder. His eyes were popping, a tic was going in one of his pouchy cheeks, and the tartan scarf didn\\'t help. \"Very well - go - and don\\'t breathe a word - not that - however, if you didn\\'t read - go now, I have to write up Peeves\\' report - go - \" Amazed at his luck, Harry sped out of the office, up the corridor, and back upstairs. To escape from Filch\\'s office without punishment was probably some kind of school record. \"Harry! Harry! Did it work?\" Nearly Headless Nick came gliding out of a classroom. Behind him, Harry could see the wreckage of a large black-and-gold cabinet that appeared to have been dropped from a great height. \"I persuaded Peeves to crash it right over Filch\\'s office,\" said Nick eagerly. \"Thought it might distract him - \" \"Was that you?\" said Harry gratefully. \"Yeah, it worked, I didn\\'t even get detention. Thanks, Nick!\" They set off up the corridor together. Nearly Headless Nick, Harry noticed, was still holding Sir Patrick\\'s rejection letter– \"I wish there was something I could do for you about the Headless Hunt,\" Harry said. Nearly Headless Nick stopped in his tracks and Harry walked right through him. He wished he hadn\\'t; it was like stepping through an icy shower. \"But there is something you could do for me,\" said Nick excitedly. \"Harry - would I be asking too much - but no, you wouldn\\'t want - \" \"What is it?\" said Harry. \"Well, this Halloween will be my five hundredth deathday,\" said Nearly Headless Nick, drawing himself up and looking dignified. \"Oh,\" said Harry, not sure whether he should look sorry or happy about this. \"Right.\" \"I\\'m holding a party down in one of the roomier dungeons. Friends will be coming from all over the country. It would be such an honor if you would attend. Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger would be most welcome, too, of course - but I daresay you\\'d rather go to the school feast?\" He watched Harry on tenterhooks. \"No,\" said Harry quickly, \"I\\'ll come - \" \"My dear boy! Harry Potter, at my deathday party! And - \" he hesitated, looking excited \" - do you think you could possibly mention to Sir Patrick how very frightening and impressive you find me?\" \"Of - of course,\" said Harry. Nearly Headless Nick beamed at him. \"A deathday party?\" said Hermione keenly when Harry had changed at last and joined her and Ron in the common room. \"I bet there aren\\'t many living people who can say they\\'ve been to one of those - it\\'ll be fascinating!\" \"Why would anyone want to celebrate the day they died?\" said Ron, who was halfway through his Potions homework and grumpy. \"Sounds dead depressing to me–\" Rain was still lashing the windows, which were now inky black, but inside all looked bright and cheerful. The firelight glowed over the countless squashy armchairs where people sat reading, talking, doing homework or, in the case of Fred and George Weasley, trying to find out what would happen if you fed a Filibuster firework to a salamander. Fred had \"rescued\" the brilliant orange, fire-dwelling lizard from a Care of Magical Creatures class and it was now smoldering gently on a table surrounded by a knot of curious people. Harry was at the point of telling Ron and Hermione about Filch and the Kwikspell course when the salamander suddenly whizzed into the air, emitting loud sparks and bangs as it whirled wildly round the room. The sight of Percy bellowing himself hoarse at Fred and George, the spectacular display of tangerine stars showering from the salamander\\'s mouth, and its escape into the fire, with accompanying explosions, drove both Filch and the Kwikspell envelope from Harry\\'s mind. By the time Halloween arrived, Harry was regretting his rash promise to go to the deathday party. The rest of the school was happily anticipating their Halloween feast; the Great Hall had been decorated with the usual live bats, Hagrid\\'s vast pumpkins had been carved into lanterns large enough for three men to sit in, and there were rumors that Dumbledore had booked a troupe of dancing skeletons for the entertainment. \"A promise is a promise,\" Hermione reminded Harry bossily. \"You said you\\'d go to the deathday party.\" So at seven o\\'clock, Harry, Ron, and Hermione walked straight past the doorway to the packed Great Hall, which was glittering invitingly with gold plates and candles, and directed their steps instead toward the dungeons. The passageway leading to Nearly Headless Nick\\'s party had been lined with candles, too, though the effect was far from cheerful: These were long, thin, jet-black tapers, all burning bright blue, casting a dim, ghostly light even over their own living faces. The temperature dropped with every step they took. As Harry shivered and drew his robes tightly around him, he heard what sounded like a thousand fingernails scraping an enormous blackboard. \"Is that supposed to be music?\" Ron whispered. They turned a corner and saw Nearly Headless Nick standing at a doorway hung with black velvet drapes. \"My dear friends,\" he said mournfully. \"Welcome, welcome– so pleased you could come–\" He swept off his plumed hat and bowed them inside. It was an incredible sight. The dungeon was full of hundreds of pearly-white, translucent people, mostly drifting around a crowded dance floor, waltzing to the dreadful, quavering sound of thirty musical saws, played by an orchestra on a raised, black-draped platform. A chandelier overhead blazed midnight-blue with a thousand more black candles. Their breath rose in a mist before them; it was like stepping into a freezer. \"Shall we have a look around?\" Harry suggested, wanting to warm up his feet. \"Careful not to walk through anyone,\" said Ron nervously, and they set off around the edge of the dance floor. They passed a group of gloomy nuns, a ragged man wearing chains, and the Fat Friar, a cheerful Hufflepuff ghost, who was talking to a knight with an arrow sticking out of his forehead. Harry wasn\\'t surprised to see that the Bloody Baron, a gaunt, staring Slytherin ghost covered in silver bloodstains, was being given a wide berth by the other ghosts. \"Oh, no,\" said Hermione, stopping abruptly. \"Turn back, turn back, I don\\'t want to talk to Moaning Myrtle - \" \"Who?\" said Harry as they backtracked quickly. \"She haunts one of the toilets in the girls\\' bathroom on the first floor,\" said Hermione. \"She haunts a toilet?\" \"Yes. It\\'s been out-of-order all year because she keeps having tantrums and flooding the place. I never went in there anyway if I could avoid it; it\\'s awful trying to have a pee with her wailing at you - \" \"Look, food!\" said Ron. On the other side of the dungeon was a long table, also covered in black velvet. They approached it eagerly but next moment had stopped in their tracks, horrified. The smell was quite disgusting. Large, rotten fish were laid on handsome silver platters; cakes, burned charcoal-black, were heaped on salvers; there was a great maggoty haggis, a slab of cheese covered in furry green mold and, in pride of place, an enormous gray cake in the shape of a tombstone, with tar-like icing forming the words, SIR NICHOLAS DE MIMSY-PORPINGTON DIED 31ST OCTOBER, 1492 Harry watched, amazed, as a portly ghost approached the table, crouched low, and walked through it, his mouth held wide so that it passed through one of the stinking salmon. \"Can you taste it if you walk though it?\" Harry asked him. \"Almost,\" said the ghost sadly, and he drifted away. \"I expect they\\'ve let it rot to give it a stronger flavor,\" said Hermione knowledgeably, pinching her nose and leaning closer to look at the putrid haggis. \"Can we move? I feel sick,\" said Ron. They had barely turned around, however, when a little man swooped suddenly from under the table and came to a halt in midair before them. \"Hello, Peeves,\" said Harry cautiously. Unlike the ghosts around them, Peeves the Poltergeist was the very reverse of pale and transparent. He was wearing a bright orange party hat, a revolving bow tie, and a broad grin on his wide, wicked face. \"Nibbles?\" he said sweetly, offering them a bowl of peanuts covered in fungus. \"No thanks,\" said Hermione. \"Heard you talking about poor Myrtle,\" said Peeves, his eyes dancing. \"Rude you was about poor Myrtle.\" He took a deep breath and bellowed, \"OY! MYRTLE!\" \"Oh, no, Peeves, don\\'t tell her what I said, she\\'ll be really upset,\" Hermione whispered frantically. \"I didn\\'t mean it, I don\\'t mind her - er, hello, Myrtle.\" The squat ghost of a girl had glided over. She had the glummest face Harry had ever seen, half-hidden behind lank hair and thick, pearly spectacles. \"What?\" she said sulkily. \"How are you, Myrtle?\" said Hermione in a falsely bright voice. \"It\\'s nice to see you out of the toilet.\" Myrtle sniffed. \"Miss Granger was just talking about you - \" said Peeves slyly in Myrtle\\'s ear. \"Just saying - \" \"Just saying - saying - how nice you look tonight,\" said Hermione, glaring at Peeves. Myrtle eyed Hermione suspiciously. \"You\\'re making fun of me,\" she said, silver tears welling rapidly in her small, see-through eyes. \"No - honestly - didn\\'t I just say how nice Myrtle\\'s looking?\" said Hermione, nudging Harry and Ron painfully in the ribs. \"Oh, yeah - \" \"She did - \" \"Don\\'t lie to me,\" Myrtle gasped, tears now flooding down her face, while Peeves chuckled happily over her shoulder. \"D\\'you think I don\\'t know what people call me behind my back? Fat Myrtle! Ugly Myrtle! Miserable, moaning, moping Myrtle!\" \"You\\'ve forgotten pimply,\" Peeves hissed in her ear. Moaning Myrtle burst into anguished sobs and fled from the dungeon. Peeves shot after her, pelting her with moldy peanuts, yelling, \"Pimply! Pimply!\" \"Oh, dear,\" said Hermione sadly. Nearly Headless Nick now drifted toward them through the crowd. \"Enjoying yourselves?\" \"Oh, yes,\" they lied. \"Not a bad turnout,\" said Nearly Headless Nick proudly. \"The Wailing Widow came all the way up from Kent– It\\'s nearly time for my speech, I\\'d better go and warn the orchestra–\" The orchestra, however, stopped playing at that very moment. They, and everyone else in the dungeon, fell silent, looking around in excitement, as a hunting horn sounded. \"Oh, here we go,\" said Nearly Headless Nick bitterly. Through the dungeon wall burst a dozen ghost horses, each ridden by a headless horseman. The assembly clapped wildly; Harry started to clap, too, but stopped quickly at the sight of Nick\\'s face. The horses galloped into the middle of the dance floor and halted, rearing and plunging. At the front of the pack was a large ghost who held his bearded head under his arm, from which position he was blowing the horn. The ghost leapt down, lifted his head high in the air so he could see over the crowd (everyone laughed), and strode over to Nearly Headless Nick, squashing his head back onto his neck. \"Nick!\" he roared. \"How are you? Head still hanging in there?\" He gave a hearty guffaw and clapped Nearly Headless Nick on the shoulder. \"Welcome, Patrick,\" said Nick stiffly. \"Live \\'uns!\" said Sir Patrick, spotting Harry, Ron, and Hermione and giving a huge, fake jump of astonishment, so that his head fell off again (the crowd howled with laughter). \"Very amusing,\" said Nearly Headless Nick darkly. \"Don\\'t mind Nick!\" shouted Sir Patrick\\'s head from the floor. \"Still upset we won\\'t let him join the Hunt! But I mean to say - look at the fellow - \" \"I think,\" said Harry hurriedly, at a meaningful look from Nick, \"Nick\\'s very - frightening and - er - \" \"Ha!\" yelled Sir Patrick\\'s head. \"Bet he asked you to say that!\" \"If I could have everyone\\'s attention, it\\'s time for my speech!\" said Nearly Headless Nick loudly, striding toward the podium and climbing into an icy blue spotlight. \"My late lamented lords, ladies, and gentlemen, it is my great sorrow–\" But nobody heard much more. Sir Patrick and the rest of the Headless Hunt had just started a game of Head Hockey and the crowd were turning to watch. Nearly Headless Nick tried vainly to recapture his audience, but gave up as Sir Patrick\\'s head went sailing past him to loud cheers. Harry was very cold by now, not to mention hungry. \"I can\\'t stand much more of this,\" Ron muttered, his teeth chattering, as the orchestra ground back into action and the ghosts swept back onto the dance floor. \"Let\\'s go,\" Harry agreed. They backed toward the door, nodding and beaming at anyone who looked at them, and a minute later were hurrying back up the passageway full of black candles. \"Pudding might not be finished yet,\" said Ron hopefully, leading the way toward the steps to the entrance hall. And then Harry heard it. \"– rip– tear– kill–\" It was the same voice, the same cold, murderous voice he had heard in Lockhart\\'s office. He stumbled to a halt, clutching at the stone wall, listening with all his might, looking around, squinting up and down the dimly lit passageway. \"Harry, what\\'re you - ?\" \"It\\'s that voice again - shut up a minute - \" \"– soo hungry– for so long–\" \"Listen!\" said Harry urgently, and Ron and Hermione froze, watching him. \"– kill– time to kill–\" The voice was growing fainter. Harry was sure it was moving away - moving upward. A mixture of fear and excitement gripped him as he stared at the dark ceiling; how could it be moving upward? Was it a phantom, to whom stone ceilings didn\\'t matter? \"This way,\" he shouted, and he began to run, up the stairs, into the entrance hall. It was no good hoping to hear anything here, the babble of talk from the Halloween feast was echoing out of the Great Hall. Harry sprinted up the marble staircase to the first floor, Ron and Hermione clattering behind him. \"Harry, what\\'re we - \" \"SHH!\" Harry strained his ears. Distantly, from the floor above, and growing fainter still, he heard the voice: \"– I smell blood– I SMELL BLOOD!\" His stomach lurched - \"It\\'s going to kill someone!\" he shouted, and ignoring Ron\\'s and Hermione\\'s bewildered faces, he ran up the next flight of steps three at a time, trying to listen over his own pounding footsteps - Harry hurtled around the whole of the second floor, Ron and Hermione panting behind him, not stopping until they turned a corner into the last, deserted passage. \"Harry, what was that all about?\" said Ron, wiping sweat off his face. \"I couldn\\'t hear anything–\" But Hermione gave a sudden gasp, pointing down the corridor. \"Look!\" Something was shining on the wall ahead. They approached slowly, squinting through the darkness. Foot-high words had been daubed on the wall between two windows, shimmering in the light cast by the flaming torches. THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS HAS BEEN OPENED. ENEMIES OF THE HEIR, BEWARE \"What\\'s that thing - hanging underneath?\" said Ron, a slight quiver in his voice. As they edged nearer, Harry almost slipped - there was a large puddle of water on the floor; Ron and Hermione grabbed him, and they inched toward the message, eyes fixed on a dark shadow beneath it. All three of them realized what it was at once, and leapt backward with a splash. Mrs. Norris, the caretaker\\'s cat, was hanging by her tail from the torch bracket. She was stiff as a board, her eyes wide and staring. For a few seconds, they didn\\'t move. Then Ron said, \"Let\\'s get out of here.\" \"Shouldn\\'t we try and help - \" Harry began awkwardly. \"Trust me,\" said Ron. \"We don\\'t want to be found here.\" But it was too late. A rumble, as though of distant thunder, told them that the feast had just ended. From either end of the corridor where they stood came the sound of hundreds of feet climbing the stairs, and the loud, happy talk of well-fed people; next moment, students were crashing into the passage from both ends. The chatter, the bustle, the noise died suddenly as the people in front spotted the hanging cat. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood alone, in the middle of the corridor, as silence fell among the mass of students pressing forward to see the grisly sight. Then someone shouted through the quiet. \"Enemies of the Heir, beware! You\\'ll be next, Mudbloods!\" It was Draco Malfoy. He had pushed to the front of the crowd, his cold eyes alive, his usually bloodless face flushed, as he grinned at the sight of the hanging, immobile cat. CHAPTER NINE The Writing on the Wall \"What\\'s going on here? What\\'s going on?\" Attracted no doubt by Malfoy\\'s shout, Argus Filch came shouldering his way through the crowd. Then he saw Mrs. Norris and fell back, clutching his face in horror. \"My cat! My cat! What\\'s happened to Mrs. Norris?\" he shrieked. And his popping eyes fell on Harry. \"You!\" he screeched. \"You! You\\'ve murdered my cat! You\\'ve killed her! I\\'ll kill you! I\\'ll - \" \"Argus!\" Dumbledore had arrived on the scene, followed by a number of other teachers. In seconds, he had swept past Harry, Ron, and Hermione and detached Mrs. Norris from the torch bracket. \"Come with me, Argus,\" he said to Filch. \"You, too, Mr. Potter, Mr. Weasley, Miss Granger.\" Lockhart stepped forward eagerly. \"My office is nearest, Headmaster - just upstairs - please feel free - \" \"Thank you, Gilderoy,\" said Dumbledore. The silent crowd parted to let them pass. Lockhart, looking excited and important, hurried after Dumbledore; so did Professors McGonagall and Snape. As they entered Lockhart\\'s darkened office there was a flurry of movement across the walls; Harry saw several of the Lockharts in the pictures dodging out of sight, their hair in rollers. The real Lockhart lit the candles on his desk and stood back. Dumbledore lay Mrs. Norris on the polished surface and began to examine her. Harry, Ron, and Hermione exchanged tense looks and sank into chairs outside the pool of candlelight, watching. The tip of Dumbledore\\'s long, crooked nose was barely an inch from Mrs. Norris\\'s fur. He was looking at her closely through his half-moon spectacles, his long fingers gently prodding and poking. Professor McGonagall was bent almost as close, her eyes narrowed. Snape loomed behind them, half in shadow, wearing a most peculiar expression: It was as though he was trying hard not to smile. And Lockhart was hovering around all of them, making suggestions. \"It was definitely a curse that killed her - probably the Transmogrifian Torture - I\\'ve seen it used many times, so unlucky I wasn\\'t there, I know the very countercurse that would have saved her–\" Lockhart\\'s comments were punctuated by Filch\\'s dry, racking sobs. He was slumped in a chair by the desk, unable to look at Mrs. Norris, his face in his hands. Much as he detested Filch, Harry couldn\\'t help feeling a bit sorry for him, though not nearly as sorry as he felt for himself If Dumbledore believed Filch, he would be expelled for sure. Dumbledore was now muttering strange words under his breath and tapping Mrs. Norris with his wand but nothing happened. She continued to look as though she had been recently stuffed. \"– I remember something very similar happening in Ouagadogou,\" said Lockhart, \"a series of attacks, the full story\\'s in my autobiography, I was able to provide the townsfolk with various amulets, which cleared the matter up at once–\" The photographs of Lockhart on the walls were all nodding in agreement as he talked. One of them had forgotten to remove his hair net. At last Dumbledore straightened up. \"She\\'s not dead, Argus,\" he said softly. Lockhart stopped abruptly in the middle of counting the number of murders he had prevented. \"Not dead?\" choked Filch, looking through his fingers at Mrs. Norris. \"But why\\'s she all - all stiff and frozen?\" \"She has been Petrified,\" said Dumbledore (\"Ah! I thought so!\" said Lockhart). \"But how, I cannot say–\" \"Ask him!\" shrieked Filch, turning his blotched and tearstained face to Harry. \"No second year could have done this,\" said Dumbledore firmly. \"it would take Dark Magic of the most advanced - \" \"He did it, he did it!\" Filch spat, his pouchy face purpling. \"You saw what he wrote on the wall! He found - in my office - he knows I\\'m a - I\\'m a - \" Filch\\'s face worked horribly. \"He knows I\\'m a Squib!\" he finished. \"I never touched Mrs. Norris!\" Harry said loudly, uncomfortably aware of everyone looking at him, including all the Lockharts on the walls. \"And I don\\'t even know what a Squib is.\" \"Rubbish!\" snarled Filch. \"He saw my Kwikspell letter!\" \"If I might speak, Headmaster,\" said Snape from the shadows, and Harry\\'s sense of foreboding increased; he was sure nothing Snape had to say was going to do him any good. \"Potter and his friends may have simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time,\" he said, a slight sneer curling his mouth as though he doubted it. \"But we do have a set of suspicious circumstances here. Why was he in the upstairs corridor at all? Why wasn\\'t he at the Halloween feast?\" Harry, Ron and Hermione all launched into an explanation about the deathday party. \"– there were hundreds of ghosts, they\\'ll tell you we were there - \" \"But why not join the feast afterward?\" said Snape, his black eyes glittering in the candlelight. \"Why go up to that corridor?\" Ron and Hermione looked at Harry. \"Because - because - \" Harry said, his heart thumping very fast; something told him it would sound very far-fetched if he told them he had been led there by a bodiless voice no one but he could hear, \"because we were tired and wanted to go to bed,\" he said. \"Without any supper?\" said Snape, a triumphant smile flickering across his gaunt face. \"I didn\\'t think ghosts provided food fit for living people at their parties.\" \"We weren\\'t hungry,\" said Ron loudly as his stomach gave a huge rumble. Snape\\'s nasty smile widened. \"I suggest, Headmaster, that Potter is not being entirely truthful,\" he said. \"It might be a good idea if he were deprived of certain privileges until he is ready to tell us the whole story. I personally feel he should be taken off the Gryffindor Quidditch team until he is ready to be honest.\" \"Really, Severus,\" said Professor McGonagall sharply, \"I see no reason to stop the boy playing Quidditch. This cat wasn\\'t hit over the head with a broomstick. There is no evidence at all that Potter has done anything wrong.\" Dumbledore was giving Harry a searching look. His twinkling light-blue gaze made Harry feel as though he were being X-rayed. \"Innocent until proven guilty, Severus,\" he said firmly. Snape looked furious. So did Filch. \"My cat has been Petrified!\" he shrieked, his eyes popping. \"I want to see some punishment!\" \"We will be able to cure her, Argus,\" said Dumbledore patiently. \"Professor Sprout recently managed to procure some Mandrakes. As soon as they have reached their full size, I will have a potion made that will revive Mrs. Norris.\" \"I\\'ll make it,\" Lockhart butted in. \"I must have done it a hundred times. I could whip up a Mandrake Restorative Draught in my sleep - \" \"Excuse me,\" said Snape icily. \"But I believe I am the Potions master at this school.\" There was a very awkward pause. \"You may go,\" Dumbledore said to Harry, Ron, and Hermione. They went, as quickly as they could without actually running. When they were a floor up from Lockhart\\'s office, they turned into an empty classroom and closed the door quietly behind them. Harry squinted at his friends\\' darkened faces. \"D\\'you think I should have told them about that voice I heard?\" \"No,\" said Ron, without hesitation. \"Hearing voices no one else can hear isn\\'t a good sign, even in the wizarding world.\" Something in Ron\\'s voice made Harry ask, \"You do believe me, don\\'t you?\" \"\\'Course I do,\" said Ron quickly. \"But - you must admit it\\'s weird–\" \"I know it\\'s weird,\" said Harry. \"The whole thing\\'s weird. What was that writing on the wall about? The Chamber Has Been Opened– What\\'s that supposed to mean?\" \"You know, it rings a sort of bell,\" said Ron slowly. \"I think someone told me a story about a secret chamber at Hogwarts once– might\\'ve been Bill–\" \"And what on earth\\'s a Squib?\" said Harry. To his surprise, Ron stifled a snigger. \"Well - it\\'s not funny really - but as it\\'s Filch,\" he said. \"A Squib is someone who was born into a wizarding family but hasn\\'t got any magic powers. Kind of the opposite of Muggle-born wizards, but Squibs are quite unusual. If Filch\\'s trying to learn magic from a Kwikspell course, I reckon he must be a Squib. It would explain a lot. Like why he hates students so much.\" Ron gave a satisfied smile. \"He\\'s bitter.\" A clock chimed somewhere. \"Midnight,\" said Harry. \"We\\'d better get to bed before Snape comes along and tries to frame us for something else.\" For a few days, the school could talk of little else but the attack on Mrs. Norris. Filch kept it fresh in everyone\\'s minds by pacing the spot where she had been attacked, as though he thought the attacker might come back. Harry had seen him scrubbing the message on the wall with Mrs. Skower\\'s All-Purpose Magical Mess Remover, but to no effect; the words still gleamed as brightly as ever on the stone. When Filch wasn\\'t guarding the scene of the crime, he was skulking red-eyed through the corridors, lunging out at unsuspecting students and trying to put them in detention for things like \"breathing loudly\\' and \"looking happy.\" Ginny Weasley seemed very disturbed by Mrs. Norris\\'s fate. According to Ron, she was a great cat lover. \"But you haven\\'t really got to know Mrs. Norris,\" Ron told her bracingly. \"Honestly, we\\'re much better off without her.\" Ginny\\'s lip trembled. \"Stuff like this doesn\\'t often happen at Hogwarts,\" Ron assured her. \"They\\'ll catch the maniac who did it and have him out of here in no time. I just hope he\\'s got time to Petrify Filch before he\\'s expelled. I\\'m only joking - \" Ron added hastily as Ginny blanched. The attack had also had an effect on Hermione. It was quite usual for Hermione to spend a lot of time reading, but she was now doing almost nothing else. Nor could Harry and Ron get much response from her when they asked what she was up to, and not until the following Wednesday did they find out. Harry had been held back in Potions, where Snape had made him stay behind to scrape tubeworms off the desks. After a hurried lunch, he went upstairs to meet Ron in the library, and saw Justin Finch-Fletchley, the Hufflepuff boy from Herbology, coming toward him. Harry had just opened his mouth to say hello when Justin caught sight of him, turned abruptly, and sped off in the opposite direction. Harry found Ron at the back of the library, measuring his History of Magic homework. Professor Binns had asked for a three foot long composition on \"The Medieval Assembly of European Wizards.\" \"I don\\'t believe it, I\\'m still eight inches short said Ron furiously, letting go of his parchment, which sprang back into a roll. \"And Hermione\\'s done four feet seven inches and her writing\\'s tiny.\" \"Where is she?\" asked Harry, grabbing the tape measure and unrolling his own homework. \"Somewhere over there,\" said Ron, pointing along the shelves. \"Looking for another book. I think she\\'s trying to read the whole library before Christmas.\" Harry told Ron about Justin Finch-Fletchley running away from him. \"Dunno why you care. I thought he was a bit of an idiot,\" said Ron, scribbling away, making his writing as large as possible. \"All that junk about Lockhart being so great - \" Hermione emerged from between the bookshelves. She looked irritable and at last seemed ready to talk to them. \"All the copies of Hogwarts, A History have been taken out,\" she said, sitting down next to Harry and Ron. \"And there\\'s a two-week waiting list. I wish I hadn\\'t left my copy at home, but I couldn\\'t fit it in my trunk with all the Lockhart books.\" \"Why do you want it?\" said Harry. \"The same reason everyone else wants it,\" said Hermione, \"to read up on the legend of the Chamber of Secrets.\" \"What\\'s that?\" said Harry quickly. \"That\\'s just it. I can\\'t remember,\" said Hermione, biting her lip. \"And I can\\'t find the story anywhere else - \" \"Hermione, let me read your composition,\" said Ron desperately, checking his watch. \"No, I won\\'t,\" said Hermione, suddenly severe. \"You\\'ve had ten days to finish it - \" \"I only need another two inches, come on - \" The bell rang. Ron and Hermione led the way to History of Magic, bickering. History of Magic was the dullest subject on their schedule. Professor Binns, who taught it, was their only ghost teacher, and the most exciting thing that ever happened in his classes was his entering the room through the blackboard. Ancient and shriveled, many people said he hadn\\'t noticed he was dead. He had simply got up to teach one day and left his body behind him in an armchair in front of the staff room fire; his routine had not varied in the slightest since. Today was as boring as ever. Professor Binns opened his notes and began to read in a flat drone like an old vacuum cleaner until nearly everyone in the class was in a deep stupor, occasionally coming to long enough to copy down a name or date, then falling asleep again. He had been speaking for half an hour when something happened that had never happened before. Hermione put up her hand. Professor Binns, glancing up in the middle of a deadly dull lecture on the International Warlock Convention of 1289, looked amazed. \"Miss - er - ?\" \"Granger, Professor. I was wondering if you could tell us anything about the Chamber of Secrets,\" said Hermione in a clear voice. Dean Thomas, who had been sitting with his mouth hanging open, gazing out of the window, jerked out of his trance; Lavender Brown\\'s head came up off her arms and Neville Longbottom\\'s elbow slipped off his desk. Professor Binns blinked. \"My subject is History of Magic,\" he said in his dry, wheezy voice. \"I deal with facts, Miss Granger, not myths and legends.\" He cleared his throat with a small noise like chalk slipping and continued, \"In September of that year, a subcommittee of Sardinian sorcerers - \" He stuttered to a halt. Hermione\\'s hand was waving in the air again. \"Miss Grant?\" \"Please, sir, don\\'t legends always have a basis in fact?\" Professor Binns was looking at her in such amazement, Harry was sure no student had ever interrupted him before, alive or dead. \"Well,\" said Professor Binns slowly, \"yes, one could argue that, I suppose.\" He peered at Hermione as though he had never seen a student properly before. \"However, the legend of which you speak is such a very sensational, even ludicrous tale - \" But the whole class was now hanging on Professor Binns\\'s every word. He looked dimly at them all, every face turned to his. Harry could tell he was completely thrown by such an unusual show of interest. \"Oh, very well,\" he said slowly. \"Let me see– the Chamber of Secrets– \"You all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago - the precise date is uncertain - by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age. The four school Houses are named after them: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin. They built this castle together, far from prying Muggle eyes, for it was an age when magic was feared by common people, and witches and wizards suffered much persecution.\" He paused, gazed blearily around the room, and continued. \"For a few years, the founders worked in harmony together, seeking out youngsters who showed signs of magic and bringing them to the castle to be educated. But then disagreements sprang up between them. A rift began to grow between Slytherin and the others. Slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted to Hogwarts. He believed that magical learning should be kept within all-magic families. He disliked taking students of Muggle parentage, believing them to be untrustworthy. After a while, there was a serious argument on the subject between Slytherin and Gryffindor, and Slytherin left the school.\" Professor Binns paused again, pursing his lips, looking like a wrinkled old tortoise. \"Reliable historical sources tell us this much,\" he said. \"But these honest facts have been obscured by the fanciful legend of the Chamber of Secrets. The story goes that Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in the castle, of which the other founders knew nothing. \"Slytherin, according to the legend, sealed the Chamber of Secrets so that none would be able to open it until his own true heir arrived at the school. The heir alone would be able to unseal the Chamber of Secrets, unleash the horror within, and use it to purge the school of all who were unworthy to study magic.\" There was silence as he finished telling the story, but it wasn\\'t the usual, sleepy silence that filled Professor Binns\\'s classes. There was unease in the air as everyone continued to watch him, hoping for more. Professor Binns looked faintly annoyed. \"The whole thing is arrant nonsense, of course,\" he said. \"Naturally, the school has been searched for evidence of such a chamber, many times, by the most learned witches and wizards. It does not exist. A tale told to frighten the gullible.\" Hermione\\'s hand was back in the air. \"Sir - what exactly do you mean by the ‚horror within\\' the Chamber?\" \"That is believed to be some sort of monster, which the Heir of Slytherin alone can control,\" said Professor Binns in his dry, reedy voice. The class exchanged nervous looks. \"I tell you, the thing does not exist,\" said Professor Binns, shuffling his notes. \"There is no Chamber and no monster.\" \"But, sir,\" said Seamus Finnigan, \"if the Chamber can only be opened by Slytherin\\'s true heir, no one else would be able to find it, would they?\" \"Nonsense, O\\'Flaherty,\" said Professor Binns in an aggravated tone. \"If a long succession of Hogwarts headmasters and headmistresses haven\\'t found the thing - \" \"But, Professor,\" piped up Parvati Patil, \"you\\'d probably have to use Dark Magic to open it - \" \"Just because a wizard doesn\\'t use Dark Magic doesn\\'t mean he can\\'t, Miss Pennyfeather,\" snapped Professor Binns. \"I repeat, if the likes of Dumbledore - \" \"But maybe you\\'ve got to be related to Slytherin, so Dumbledore couldn\\'t - \" began Dean Thomas, but Professor Binns had had enough. \"That will do,\" he said sharply. \"It is a myth! It does not exist! There is not a shred of evidence that Slytherin ever built so much as a secret broom cupboard! I regret telling you such a foolish story! We will return, if you please, to history, to solid, believable, verifiable fact!\" And within five minutes, the class had sunk back into its usual torpor. \"I always knew Salazar Slytherin was a twisted old loony,\" Ron told Harry and Hermione as they fought their way through the teeming corridors at the end of the lesson to drop off their bags before dinner. \"But I never knew he started all this pure-blood stuff. I wouldn\\'t be in his house if you paid me. Honestly, if the Sorting Hat had tried to put me in Slytherin, I\\'d\\'ve got the train straight back home–\" Hermione nodded fervently, but Harry didn\\'t say anything. His stomach had just dropped unpleasantly. Harry had never told Ron and Hermione that the Sorting Hat had seriously considered putting him in Slytherin. He could remember, as though it were yesterday, the small voice that had spoken in his ear when he\\'d placed the hat on his head a year before: You could be great, you know, it\\'s all here in your head, and Slytherin would help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that– But Harry, who had already heard of Slytherin House\\'s reputation for turning out Dark wizards, had thought desperately, Not Slytherin! and the hat had said, Oh, well, if you\\'re sure– better be Gryffindor– As they were shunted along in the throng, Colin Creevy went past. \"Hiya, Harry!\" \"Hullo, Colin,\" said Harry automatically. \"Harry - Harry - a boy in my class has been saying you\\'re - \" But Colin was so small he couldn\\'t fight against the tide of people bearing him toward the Great Hall; they heard him squeak, \"See you, Harry!\" and he was gone. \"What\\'s a boy in his class saying about you?\" Hermione wondered. \"That I\\'m Slytherin\\'s heir, I expect,\" said Harry, his stomach dropping another inch or so as he suddenly remembered the way Justin Finch-Fletchley had run away from him at lunchtime. \"People here\\'ll believe anything,\" said Ron in disgust. The crowd thinned and they were able to climb the next staircase without difficulty. \"D\\'you really think there\\'s a Chamber of Secrets?\" Ron asked Hermione. \"I don\\'t know,\" she said, frowning. \"Dumbledore couldn\\'t cure Mrs. Norris, and that makes me think that whatever attacked her might not be - well - human.\" As she spoke, they turned a corner and found themselves at the end of the very corridor where the attack had happened. They stopped and looked. The scene was just as it had been that night, except that there was no stiff cat hanging from the torch bracket, and an empty chair stood against the wall bearing the message \"The Chamber of Secrets has been Opened.\" \"That\\'s where Filch has been keeping guard,\" Ron muttered. They looked at each other. The corridor was deserted. \"Can\\'t hurt to have a poke around,\" said Harry, dropping his bag and getting to his hands and knees so that he could crawl along, searching for clues. \"Scorch marks!\" he said. \"Here - and here - \" \"Come and look at this!\" said Hermione. \"This is funny–\" Harry got up and crossed to the window next to the message on the wall. Hermione was pointing at the topmost pane, where around twenty spiders were scuttling, apparently fighting to get through a small crack. A long, silvery thread was dangling like a rope, as though they had all climbed it in their hurry to get outside. \"Have you ever seen spiders act like that?\" said Hermione wonderingly. \"No,\" said Harry, \"have you, Ron? Ron?\" He looked over his shoulder. Ron was standing well back and seemed to be fighting the impulse to run. \"What\\'s up?\" said Harry. \"I - don\\'t - like - spiders,\" said Ron tensely. \"I never knew that,\" said Hermione, looking at Ron in surprise. \"You\\'ve used spiders in Potions loads of times–\" \"I don\\'t mind them dead,\" said Ron, who was carefully looking anywhere but at the window. \"I just don\\'t like the way they move–\" Hermione giggled. \"It\\'s not funny,\" said Ron, fiercely. \"If you must know, when I was three, Fred turned my - my teddy bear into a great big filthy spider because I broke his toy broomstick– You wouldn\\'t like them either if you\\'d been holding your bear and suddenly it had too many legs and–\" He broke off, shuddering. Hermione was obviously still trying not to laugh. Feeling they had better get off the subject, Harry said, \"Remember all that water on the floor? Where did that come from? Someone\\'s mopped it up.\" \"It was about here,\" said Ron, recovering himself to walk a few paces past Filch\\'s chair and pointing. \"Level with this door.\" He reached for the brass doorknob but suddenly withdrew his hand as though he\\'d been burned. \"What\\'s the matter?\" said Harry. \"Can\\'t go in there,\" said Ron gruffly. \"That\\'s a girls\\' toilet.\" \"Oh, Ron, there won\\'t be anyone in there,\" said Hermione standing up and coming over. \"That\\'s Moaning Myrtle\\'s place. Come on, let\\'s have a look.\" And ignoring the large OUT OF ORDER sign, she opened the door. It was the gloomiest, most depressing bathroom Harry had ever set foot in. Under a large, cracked, and spotted mirror were a row of chipped sinks. The floor was damp and reflected the dull light given off by the stubs of a few candles, burning low in their holders; the wooden doors to the stalls were flaking and scratched and one of them was dangling off its hinges. Hermione put her fingers to her lips and set off toward the end stall. When she reached it she said, \"Hello, Myrtle, how are you?\" Harry and Ron went to look. Moaning Myrtle was floating above the tank of the toilet, picking a spot on her chin. \"This is a girls\\' bathroom,\" she said, eyeing Ron and Harry suspiciously. \"They\\'re not girls.\" \"No,\" Hermione agreed. \"I just wanted to show them how er - nice it is in here.\" She waved vaguely at the dirty old mirror and the damp floor. \"Ask her if she saw anything,\" Harry mouthed at Hermione. \"What are you whispering?\" said Myrtle, staring at him. \"Nothing,\" said Harry quickly. \"We wanted to ask - \" \"I wish people would stop talking behind my back!\" said Myrtle, in a voice choked with tears. \"I do have feelings, you know, even if I am dead - \" \"Myrtle, no one wants to upset you,\" said Hermione. \"Harry only - \" \"No one wants to upset me! That\\'s a good one!\" howled Myrtle. \"My life was nothing but misery at this place and now people come along ruining my death!\" \"We wanted to ask you if you\\'ve seen anything funny lately,\" said Hermione quickly. \"Because a cat was attacked right outside your front door on Halloween.\" \"Did you see anyone near here that night?\" said Harry. \"I wasn\\'t paying attention,\" said Myrtle dramatically. \"Peeves upset me so much I came in here and tried to kill myself. Then, of course, I remembered that I\\'m - that I\\'m - \" \"Already dead,\" said Ron helpfully. Myrtle gave a tragic sob, rose up in the air, turned over, and dived headfirst into the toilet, splashing water all over them and vanishing from sight, although from the direction of her muffled sobs, she had come to rest somewhere in the U-bend. Harry and Ron stood with their mouths open, but Hermione shrugged wearily and said, \"Honestly, that was almost cheerful for Myrtle– Come on, let\\'s go.\" Harry had barely closed the door on Myrtle\\'s gurgling sobs when a loud voice made all three of them jump. \"RON!\" Percy Weasley had stopped dead at the head of the stairs, prefect badge agleam, an expression of complete shock on his face. \"That\\'s a girls\\' bathroom!\" he gasped. \"What were you - ?\" \"Just having a look around,\" Ron shrugged. \"Clues, you know - \" Percy swelled in a manner that reminded Harry forcefully of Mrs. Weasley. \"Get - away - from - there - \" Perry said, striding toward them and starting to bustle them along, flapping his arms. \"Don\\'t you care what this looks like? Coming back here while everyone\\'s at dinner - \" \"Why shouldn\\'t we be here?\" said Ron hotly, stopping short and glaring at Percy. \"Listen, we never laid a finger on that cat!\" \"That\\'s what I told Ginny,\" said Percy fiercely, \"but she still seems to think you\\'re going to be expelled, I\\'ve never seen her so upset, crying her eyes out, you might think of her, all the first years are thoroughly overexcited by this business - \" \"You don\\'t care about Ginny,\" said Ron, whose ears were now reddening. \"You\\'re just worried I\\'m going to mess up your chances of being Head Boy - \" \"Five points from Gryffindor!\" Percy said tersely, fingering his prefect badge. \"And I hope it teaches you a lesson! No more detective work, or I\\'ll write to Mum!\" And he strode off, the back of his neck as red as Ron\\'s ears. Harry, Ron, and Hermione chose seats as far as possible from Percy in the common room that night. Ron was still in a very bad temper and kept blotting his Charms homework. When he reached absently for his wand to remove the smudges, it ignited the parchment. Fuming almost as much as his homework, Ron slammed The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2 shut. To Harry\\'s surprise, Hermione followed suit. \"Who can it be, though?\" she said in a quiet voice, as though continuing a conversation they had just been having. \"Who\\'d want to frighten all the Squibs and Muggle-borns out of Hogwart\\'s?\" \"Let\\'s think,\" said Ron in mock puzzlement. \"Who do we know who thinks Muggle-borns are scum?\" He looked at Hermione. Hermione looked back, unconvinced. \"If you\\'re talking about Malfoy - \" \"Of course I am!\" said Ron. \"You heard him - ‚You\\'ll be next, Mudbloods!\\' - come on, you\\'ve only got to look at his foul rat face to know it\\'s him - \" \"Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?\" said Hermione skeptically. \"Look at his family,\" said Harry, closing his books, too. \"The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin; he\\'s always boasting about it. They could easily be Slytherin\\'s descendants. His father\\'s definitely evil enough.\" \"They could\\'ve had the key to the Chamber of Secrets for centuries!\" said Ron. \"Handing it down, father to son–\" \"Well,\" said Hermione cautiously, \"I suppose it\\'s possible–\" \"But how do we prove it?\" said Harry darkly. \"There might be a way,\" said Hermione slowly, dropping her voice still further with a quick glance across the room at Percy. \"Of course, it would be difficult. And dangerous, very dangerous. We\\'d be breaking about fifty school rules, I expect - \" \"If, in a month or so, you feel like explaining, you will let us know, won\\'t you?\" said Ron irritably. \"All right,\" said Hermione coldly. \"What we\\'d need to do is to get inside the Slytherin common room and ask Malfoy a few questions without him realizing it\\'s us.\" \"But that\\'s impossible,\" Harry said as Ron laughed. \"No, it\\'s not,\" said Hermione. \"All we\\'d need would be some Polyjuice Potion.\" \"What\\'s that?\" said Ron and Harry together. \"Snape mentioned it in class a few weeks ago - \" \"D\\'you think we\\'ve got nothing better to do in Potions than listen to Snape?\" muttered Ron. \"It transforms you into somebody else. Think about it! We could change into three of the Slytherins. No one would know it was us. Malfoy would probably tell us anything. He\\'s probably boasting about it in the Slytherin common room right now, if only we could hear him.\" \"This Polyjuice stuff sounds a bit dodgy to me,\" said Ron, frowning. \"What if we were stuck looking like three of the Slytherins forever?\" \"It wears off after a while,\" said Hermione, waving her hand impatiently. \"But getting hold of the recipe will be very difficult. Snape said it was in a book called Moste Potente Potions and it\\'s bound to be in the Restricted Section of the library.\" There was only one way to get out a book from the Restricted Section: You needed a signed note of permission from a teacher. \"Hard to see why we\\'d want the book, really,\" said Ron, \"if we weren\\'t going to try and make one of the potions.\" \"I think,\" said Hermione, \"that if we made it sound as though we were just interested in the theory, we might stand a chance– \"Oh, come on, no teacher\\'s going to fall for that,\" said Ron. \"They\\'d have to be really thick–\" CHAPTER TEN The Rogue Bludger Since the disastrous episode of the pixies, Professor Lockhart had not brought live creatures to class. Instead, he read passages from his books to them, and sometimes reenacted some of the more dramatic bits. He usually picked Harry to help him with these reconstructions; so far, Harry had been forced to play a simple Transylvanian villager whom Lockhart had cured of a Babbling Curse, a yeti with a head cold, and a vampire who had been unable to eat anything except lettuce since Lockhart had dealt with him. Harry was hauled to the front of the class during their very next Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson, this time acting a werewolf. If he hadn\\'t had a very good reason for keeping Lockhart in a good mood, he would have refused to do it. \"Nice loud howl, Harry - exactly - and then, if you\\'ll believe it, I pounced - like this - slammed him to the floor - thus with one hand, I managed to hold him down - with my other, I put my wand to his throat - I then screwed up my remaining strength and performed the immensely complex Homorphus Charm - he let out a piteous moan - go on, Harry - higher than that - good - the fur vanished - the fangs shrank - and he turned back into a man. Simple, yet effective - and another village will remember me forever as the hero who delivered them from the monthly terror of werewolf attacks.\" The bell rang and Lockhart got to his feet. \"Homework - compose a poem about my defeat of the Wagga Wagga Werewolf! Signed copies of Magical Me to the author of the best one!\" The class began to leave. Harry returned to the back of the room, where Ron and Hermione were waiting. \"Ready?\" Harry muttered. \"Wait till everyone\\'s gone,\" said Hermione nervously. \"All right–\" She approached Lockhart\\'s desk, a piece of paper clutched tightly in her hand, Harry and Ron right behind her. \"Er - Professor Lockhart?\" Hermione stammered. \"I wanted to - to get this book out of the library. Just for background reading.\" She held out the piece of paper, her hand shaking slightly. \"But the thing is, it\\'s in the Restricted Section of the library, so I need a teacher to sign for it - I\\'m sure it would help me understand what you say in Gadding with Ghouls about slow-acting venoms.\" \"Ah, Gadding with Ghouls!\" said Lockhart, taking the note from Hermione and smiling widely at her. \"Possibly my very favorite book. You enjoyed it?\" \"Oh, yes,\" said Hermione eagerly. \"So clever, the way you trapped that last one with the tea-strainer - \" \"Well, I\\'m sure no one will mind me giving the best student of the year a little extra help,\" said Lockhart warmly, and he pulled out an enormous peacock quill. \"Yes, nice, isn\\'t it?\" he said, misreading the revolted look on Ron\\'s face. \"I usually save it for book-signings.\" He scrawled an enormous loopy signature on the note and handed it back to Hermione. \"So, Harry,\" said Lockhart, while Hermione folded the note with fumbling fingers and slipped it into her bag. \"Tomorrow\\'s the first Quidditch match of the season, I believe? Gryffindor against Slytherin, is it not? I hear you\\'re a useful player. I was a Seeker, too. I was asked to try for the National Squad, but preferred to dedicate my life to the eradication of the Dark Forces. Still, if ever you feel the need for a little private training, don\\'t hesitate to ask. Always happy to pass on my expertise to less able players–\" Harry made an indistinct noise in his throat and then hurried off after Ron and Hermione. \"I don\\'t believe it,\" he said as the three of them examined the signature on the note. \"He didn\\'t even look at the book we wanted.\" \"That\\'s because he\\'s a brainless git,\" said Ron. \"But who cares, we\\'ve got what we needed - \" \"He is not a brainless git,\" said Hermione shrilly as they half ran toward the library. \"Just because he said you were the best student of the year - \" They dropped their voices as they entered the muffled stillness of the library. Madam Pince, the librarian, was a thin, irritable woman who looked like an underfed vulture. \"Moste Potente Potions?\" she repeated suspiciously, trying to take the note from Hermione; but Hermione wouldn\\'t let go. \"I was wondering if I could keep it,\" she said breathlessly. \"Oh, come on,\" said Ron, wrenching it from her grasp and thrusting it at Madam Pince. \"We\\'ll get you another autograph. Lockhart\\'ll sign anything if it stands still long enough.\" Madam Pince held the note up to the light, as though determined to detect a forgery, but it passed the test. She stalked away between the lofty shelves and returned several minutes later carrying a large and moldy-looking book. Hermione put it carefully into her bag and they left, trying not to walk too quickly or look too guilty. Five minutes later, they were barricaded in Moaning Myrtle\\'s out-of-order bathroom once again. Hermione had overridden Ron\\'s objections by pointing out that it was the last place anyone in their right minds would go, so they were guaranteed some privacy. Moaning Myrtle was crying noisily in her stall, but they were ignoring her, and she them. Hermione opened Moste Potente Potions carefully, and the three of them bent over the damp-spotted pages. It was clear from a glance why it belonged in the Restricted Section. Some of the potions had effects almost too gruesome to think about, and there were some very unpleasant illustrations, which included a man who seemed to have been turned inside out and a witch sprouting several extra pairs of arms out of her head. \"Here it is,\" said Hermione excitedly as she found the page headed The Polyjuice Potion. It was decorated with drawings of people halfway through transforming into other people. Harry sincerely hoped the artist had imagined the looks of intense pain on their faces. \"This is the most complicated potion I\\'ve ever seen,\" said Hermione as they scanned the recipe. \"Lacewing flies, leeches, fluxweed, and knotgrass,\" she murmured, running her finger down the list of ingredients. \"Well, they\\'re easy enough, they\\'re in the student store-cupboard, we can help ourselves– Oooh, look, powdered horn of a bicorn - don\\'t know where we\\'re going to get that - shredded skin of a boomslang - that\\'ll be tricky, too and of course a bit of whoever we want to change into.\" \"Excuse me?\" said Ron sharply. \"What d\\'you mean, a bit of whoever we\\'re changing into? I\\'m drinking nothing with Crabbe\\'s toenails in it - \" Hermione continued as though she hadn\\'t heard him. \"We don\\'t have to worry about that yet, though, because we add those bits last–\" Ron turned, speechless, to Harry, who had another worry. \"D\\'you realize how much we\\'re going to have to steal, Hermione? Shredded skin of a boomslang, that\\'s definitely not in the students\\' cupboard. What\\'re we going to do, break into Snape\\'s private stores? I don\\'t know if this is a good idea–\" Hermione shut the book with a snap. \"Well, if you two are going to chicken out, fine,\" she said. There were bright pink patches on her cheeks and her eyes were brighter than usual. \"I don\\'t want to break rules, you know. I think threatening Muggle-borns is far worse than brewing up a difficult potion. But if you don\\'t want to find out if it\\'s Malfoy, I\\'ll go straight to Madam Pince now and hand the book back in.\\' \"I never thought I\\'d see the day when you\\'d be persuading us to break rules,\" said Ron. \"All right, we\\'ll do it. But not toenails, okay?\" \"How long will it take to make, anyway?\" said Harry as Hermione, looking happier, opened the book again. \"Well, since the fluxweed has got to be picked at the full moon and the lacewings have got to be stewed for twenty-one days– I\\'d say it\\'d be ready in about a month, if we can get all the ingredients.\" \"A month?\" said Ron. \"Malfoy could have attacked half the Muggle-borns in the school by then!\" But Hermione\\'s eyes narrowed dangerously again, and he added swiftly, \"But it\\'s the best plan we\\'ve got, so full steam ahead, I say.\" However, while Hermione was checking that the coast was clear for them to leave the bathroom, Ron muttered to Harry, \"It\\'ll be a lot less hassle if you can just knock Malfoy off his broom tomorrow.\" Harry woke early on Saturday morning and lay for a while thinking about the coming Quidditch match. He was nervous, mainly at the thought of what Wood would say if Gryffindor lost, but also at the idea of facing a team mounted on the fastest racing brooms gold could buy. He had never wanted to beat Slytherin so badly. After half an hour of lying there with his insides churning, he got up, dressed, and went down to breakfast early, where he found the rest of the Gryffindor team huddled at the long, empty table, all looking uptight and not speaking much. As eleven o\\'clock approached, the whole school started to make its way down to the Quidditch stadium. It was a muggy sort of day with a hint of thunder in the air. Ron and Hermione came hurrying over to wish Harry good luck as he entered the locker rooms. The team pulled on their scarlet Gryffindor robes, then sat down to listen to Wood\\'s usual pre-match pep talk. \"Slytherin has better brooms than us,\" he began. \"No point denying it. But we\\'ve got better people on our brooms. We\\'ve trained harder than they have, we\\'ve been flying in all weathers - \"(\"Too true,\" muttered George Weasley. \"I haven\\'t been properly dry since August\") \" - and we\\'re going to make them rue the day they let that little bit of slime, Malfoy, buy his way onto their team.\" Chest heaving with emotion, Wood turned to Harry. \"It\\'ll be down to you, Harry, to show them that a Seeker has to have something more than a rich father. Get to that Snitch before Malfoy or die trying, Harry, because we\\'ve got to win today, we\\'ve got to.\" \"So no pressure, Harry\" said Fred, winking at him. As they walked out onto the pitch, a roar of noise greeted them; mainly cheers, because Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were anxious to see Slytherin beaten, but the Slytherins in the crowd made their boos and hisses heard, too. Madam Hooch, the Quidditch teacher, asked Flint and Wood to shake hands, which they did, giving each other threatening stares and gripping rather harder than was necessary. \"On my whistle,\" said Madam Hooch. \"Three– two– one–\" With a roar from the crowd to speed them upward, the fourteen players rose toward the leaden sky. Harry flew higher than any of them, squinting around for the Snitch. \"All right there, Scarhead?\" yelled Malfoy, shooting underneath him as though to show off the speed of his broom. Harry had no time to reply. At that very moment, a heavy black Bludger came pelting toward him; he avoided it so narrowly that he felt it ruffle his hair as it passed. \"Close one, Harry!\" said George, streaking past him with his club in his hand, ready to knock the Bludger back toward a Slytherin. Harry saw George give the Bludger a powerful whack in the direction of Adrian Pucey, but the Bludger changed direction in midair and shot straight for Harry again. Harry dropped quickly to avoid it, and George managed to hit it hard toward Malfoy. Once again, the Bludger swerved like a boomerang and shot at Harry\\'s head. Harry put on a burst of speed and zoomed toward the other end of the pitch. He could hear the Bludger whistling along behind him. What was going on? Bludgers never concentrated on one player like this; it was their job to try and unseat as many people as possible– Fred Weasley was waiting for the Bludger at the other end. Harry ducked as Fred swung at the Bludger with all his might; the Bludger was knocked off course. \"Gotcha!\" Fred yelled happily, but he was wrong; as though it was magnetically attracted to Harry, the Bludger pelted after him once more and Harry was forced to fly off at full speed. It had started to rain; Harry felt heavy drops fall onto his face, splattering onto his glasses. He didn\\'t have a clue what was going on in the rest of the game until he heard Lee Jordan, who was commentating, say, \"Slytherin lead, sixty points to zero.\\' The Slytherins\\' superior brooms were clearly doing their jobs, and meanwhile the mad Bludger was doing all it could to knock Harry out of the air. Fred and George were now flying so close to him on either side that Harry could see nothing at all except their flailing arms and had no chance to look for the Snitch, let alone catch it. \"Someone\\'s - tampered - with - this - Bludger - \" Fred grunted, swinging his bat with all his might at it as it launched a new attack on Harry. \"We need time out,\" said George, trying to signal to Wood and stop the Bludger breaking Harry\\'s nose at the same time. Wood had obviously got the message. Madam Hooch\\'s whistle rang out and Harry, Fred, and George dived for the ground, still trying to avoid the mad Bludger. \"What\\'s going on?\" said Wood as the Gryffindor team huddled together, while Slytherins in the crowd jeered. \"We\\'re being flattened. Fred, George, where were you when that Bludger stopped Angelina scoring?\" \"We were twenty feet above her, stopping the other Bludger from murdering Harry, Oliver,\" said George angrily. \"Someone\\'s fixed it - it won\\'t leave Harry alone. It hasn\\'t gone for anyone else all game. The Slytherins must have done something to it.\" \"But the Bludgers have been locked in Madam Hooch\\'s office since our last practice, and there was nothing wrong with them then–\" said Wood, anxiously. Madam Hooch was walking toward them. Over her shoulder, Harry could see the Slytherin team jeering and pointing in his direction. \"Listen,\" said Harry as she came nearer and nearer, \"with you two flying around me all the time the only way I\\'m going to catch the Snitch is if it flies up my sleeve. Go back to the rest of the team and let me deal with the rogue one.\" \"Don\\'t be thick,\" said Fred. \"It\\'ll take your head off.\" Wood was looking from Harry to the Weasleys. \"Oliver, this is insane,\" said Alicia Spinner angrily. \"You can\\'t let Harry deal with that thing on his own. Let\\'s ask for an inquiry–\" \"If we stop now, we\\'ll have to forfeit the match!\" said Harry. \"And we\\'re not losing to Slytherin just because of a crazy Bludger! Come on, Oliver, tell them to leave me alone!\" \"This is all your fault,\" George said angrily to Wood. \"‚Get the Snitch or die trying,\\' what a stupid thing to tell him - \" Madam Hooch had joined them. \"Ready to resume play?\" she asked Wood. Wood looked at the determined look on Harry\\'s face. \"All right,\" he said. \"Fred, George, you heard Harry - leave him alone and let him deal with the Bludger on his own.\" The rain was falling more heavily now. On Madam Hooch\\'s whistle, Harry kicked hard into the air and heard the telltale whoosh of the Bludger behind him. Higher and higher Harry climbed; he looped and swooped, spiraled, zigzagged, and rolled. Slightly dizzy, he nevertheless kept his eyes wide open, rain was speckling his glasses and ran up his nostrils as he hung upside down, avoiding another fierce dive from the Bludger. He could hear laughter from the crowd; he knew he must look very stupid, but the rogue Bludger was heavy and couldn\\'t change direction as quickly as Harry could; he began a kind of roller-coaster ride around the edges of the stadium, squinting through the silver sheets of rain to the Gryffindor goal posts, where Adrian Pucey was trying to get past Wood. A whistling in Harry\\'s ear told him the Bludger had just missed him again; he turned right over and sped in the opposite direction. \"Training for the ballet, Potter?\" yelled Malfoy as Harry was forced to do a stupid kind of twirl in midair to dodge the Bludger, and he fled, the Bludger trailing a few feet behind him; and then, glaring back at Malfoy in hatred, he saw it - the Golden Snitch. It was hovering inches above Malfoy\\'s left ear - and Malfoy, busy laughing at Harry, hadn\\'t seen it. For an agonizing moment, Harry hung in midair, not daring to speed toward Malfoy in case he looked up and saw the Snitch. WHAM. He had stayed still a second too long. The Bludger had hit him at last, smashed into his elbow, and Harry felt his arm break. Dimly, dazed by the searing pain in his arm, he slid sideways on his rain-drenched broom, one knee still crooked over it, his right arm dangling useless at his side - the Bludger came pelting back for a second attack, this time zooming at his face - Harry swerved out of the way, one idea firmly lodged in his numb brain: get to Malfoy. Through a haze of rain and pain he dived for the shimmering, sneering face below him and saw its eyes widen with fear: Malfoy thought Harry was attacking him. \"What the - \" he gasped, careening out of Harry\\'s way. Harry took his remaining hand off his broom and made a wild snatch; he felt his fingers close on the cold Snitch but was now only gripping the broom with his legs, and there was a yell from the crowd below as he headed straight for the ground, trying hard not to pass out. With a splattering thud he hit the mud and rolled off his broom. His arm was hanging at a very strange angle; riddled with pain, he heard, as though from a distance, a good deal of whistling and shouting. He focused on the Snitch clutched in his good hand. \"Aha,\" he said vaguely. \"We\\'ve won.\" And he fainted. He came around, rain falling on his face, still lying on the field, with someone leaning over him. He saw a glitter of teeth. \"Oh, no, not you,\" he moaned. \"Doesn\\'t know what he\\'s saying,\" said Lockhart loudly to the anxious crowd of Gryffindors pressing around them. \"Not to worry, Harry. I\\'m about to fix your arm.\" \"No!\" said Harry. \"I\\'ll keep it like this, thanks–\" He tried to sit up, but the pain was terrible. He heard a familiar clicking noise nearby. \"I don\\'t want a photo of this, Colin,\" he said loudly. \"Lie back, Harry,\" said Lockhart soothingly. \"It\\'s a simple charm I\\'ve used countless times - \" \"Why can\\'t I just go to the hospital wing?\" said Harry through clenched teeth. \"He should really, Professor,\" said a muddy Wood, who couldn\\'t help grinning even though his Seeker was injured. \"Great capture, Harry, really spectacular, your best yet, I\\'d say - \" Through the thicket of legs around him, Harry spotted Fred and George Weasley, wrestling the rogue Bludger into a box. It was still putting up a terrific fight. \"Stand back,\" said Lockhart, who was rolling up his jade-green sleeves. \"No - don\\'t - \" said Harry weakly, but Lockhart was twirling his wand and a second later had directed it straight at Harry\\'s arm. A strange and unpleasant sensation started at Harry\\'s shoulder and spread all the way down to his fingertips. It felt as though his arm was being deflated. He didn\\'t dare look at what was happening. He had shut his eyes, his face turned away from his arm, but his worst fears were realized as the people above him gasped and Colin Creevey began clicking away madly. His arm didn\\'t hurt anymore - nor did it feel remotely like an arm. \"Ah,\" said Lockhart. \"Yes. Well, that can sometimes happen. But the point is, the bones are no longer broken. That\\'s the thing to bear in mind. So, Harry, just toddle up to the hospital wing - ah, Mr. Weasley, Miss Granger, would you escort him? - and Madam Pomfrey will be able to - er - tidy you up a bit.\" As Harry got to his feet, he felt strangely lopsided. Taking a deep breath he looked down at his right side. What he saw nearly made him pass out again. Poking out of the end of his robes was what looked like a thick, flesh-colored rubber glove. He tried to move his fingers. Nothing happened. Lockhart hadn\\'t mended Harry\\'s bones. He had removed them. Madam Pomfrey wasn\\'t at all pleased. \"You should have come straight to me!\" she raged, holding up the sad, limp remainder of what, half an hour before, had been a working arm. \"I can mend bones in a second - but growing them back - \" \"You will be able to, won\\'t you?\" said Harry desperately. \"I\\'ll be able to, certainly, but it will be painful,\" said Madam Pomfrey grimly, throwing Harry a pair of pajamas. \"You\\'ll have to stay the night–\" Hermione waited outside the curtain drawn around Harry\\'s bed while Ron helped him into his pajamas. It took a while to stuff the rubbery, boneless arm into a sleeve. \"How can you stick up for Lockhart now, Hermione, eh?\" Ron called through the curtain as he pulled Harry\\'s limp fingers through the cuff. \"If Harry had wanted deboning he would have asked.\" \"Anyone can make a mistake,\" said Hermione. \"And it doesn\\'t hurt anymore, does it, Harry?\" \"No,\" said Harry, getting into bed. \"But it doesn\\'t do anything else either.\" As he swung himself onto the bed, his arm flapped pointlessly. Hermione and Madam Pomfrey came around the curtain. Madam Pomfrey was holding a large bottle of something labeled Skele-Gro. \"You\\'re in for a rough night,\" she said, pouring out a steaming beakerful and handing it to him. \"Regrowing bones is a nasty business.\" So was taking the Skele-Gro. It burned Harry\\'s mouth and throat as it went down, making him cough and splutter. Still tut-tutting about dangerous sports and inept teachers, Madam Pomfrey retreated, leaving Ron and Hermione to help Harry gulp down some water. \"We won, though,\" said Ron, a grin breaking across his face. \"That was some catch you made. Malfoy\\'s face– he looked ready to kill–\" \"I want to know how he fixed that Bludger,\" said Hermione darkly. \"We can add that to the list of questions we\\'ll ask him when we\\'ve taken the Polyjuice Potion,\" said Harry, sinking back onto his pillows. \"I hope it tastes better than this stuff–\" \"If it\\'s got bits of Slytherins in it? You\\'ve got to be joking,\" said Ron. The door of the hospital wing burst open at that moment. Filthy and soaking wet, the rest of the Gryffindor team had arrived to see Harry. \"Unbelievable flying, Harry,\" said George. \"I\\'ve just seen Marcus Flint yelling at Malfoy. Something about having the Snitch on top of his head and not noticing. Malfoy didn\\'t seem too happy.\" They had brought cakes, sweets, and bottles of pumpkin juice; they gathered around Harry\\'s bed and were just getting started on what promised to be a good party when Madam Pomfrey came storming over, shouting, \"This boy needs rest, he\\'s got thirty-three bones to regrow! Out! OUT!\" And Harry was left alone, with nothing to distract him from the stabbing pains in his limp arm. Hours and hours later, Harry woke quite suddenly in the pitch blackness and gave a small yelp of pain: His arm now felt full of large splinters. For a second, he thought that was what had woken him. Then, with a thrill of horror, he realized that someone was sponging his forehead in the dark. \"Get off!\" he said loudly, and then, \"Dobby!\" The house-elf\\'s goggling tennis ball eyes were peering at Harry through the darkness. A single tear was running down his long, pointed nose. \"Harry Potter came back to school,\" he whispered miserably. \"Dobby warned and warned Harry Potter. Ah sir, why didn\\'t you heed Dobby? Why didn\\'t Harry Potter go back home when he missed the train?\" Harry heaved himself up on his pillows and pushed Dobby\\'s sponge away. \"What\\'re you doing here?\" he said. \"And how did you know I missed the train?\" Dobby\\'s lip trembled and Harry was seized by a sudden suspicion. \"It was you!\" he said slowly. \"You stopped the barrier from letting us through!\" \"Indeed yes, sir,\" said Dobby, nodding his head vigorously, ears flapping. \"Dobby hid and watched for Harry Potter and sealed the gateway and Dobby had to iron his hands afterward\" - he showed Harry ten long, bandaged fingers - \"but Dobby didn\\'t care, sir, for he thought Harry Potter was safe, and never did Dobby dream that Harry Potter would get to school another way!\" He was rocking backward and forward, shaking his ugly head. \"Dobby was so shocked when he heard Harry Potter was back at Hogwarts, he let his master\\'s dinner burn! Such a flogging Dobby never had, sir–\" Harry slumped back onto his pillows. \"You nearly got Ron and me expelled,\" he said fiercely. \"You\\'d better get lost before my bones come back, Dobby, or I might strangle you.\" Dobby smiled weakly. \"Dobby is used to death threats, sir. Dobby gets them five times a day at home.\" He blew his nose on a corner of the filthy pillowcase he wore, looking so pathetic that Harry felt his anger ebb away in spite of himself. \"Why d\\'you wear that thing, Dobby?\" he asked curiously. \"This, sir?\" said Dobby, plucking at the pillowcase. \"‚Tis a mark of the house-elf\\'s enslavement, sir. Dobby can only be freed if his masters present him with clothes, sir. The family is careful not to pass Dobby even a sock, sir, for then he would be free to leave their house forever.\" Dobby mopped his bulging eyes and said suddenly, \"Harry Potter must go home! Dobby thought his Bludger would be enough to make - \" \"Your Bludger?\" said Harry, anger rising once more. \"What d\\'you mean, your Bludger? You made that Bludger try and kill me?\" \"Not kill you, sir, never kill you!\" said Dobby, shocked. \"Dobby wants to save Harry Potter\\'s life! Better sent home, grievously injured, than remain here sir! Dobby only wanted Harry Potter hurt enough to be sent home!\" \"Oh, is that all?\" said Harry angrily. \"I don\\'t suppose you\\'re going to tell me why you wanted me sent home in pieces?\" \"Ah, if Harry Potter only knew!\" Dobby groaned, more tears dripping onto his ragged pillowcase. \"If he knew what he means to us, to the lowly, the enslaved, we dregs of the magical world! Dobby remembers how it was when He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named was at the height of his powers, sir! We house-elves were treated like vermin, sir! Of course, Dobby is still treated like that, sir,\" he admitted, drying his face on the pillowcase. \"But mostly, sir, life has improved for my kind since you triumphed over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. Harry Potter survived, and the Dark Lord\\'s power was broken, and it was a new dawn, sir, and Harry Potter shone like a beacon of hope for those of us who thought the Dark days would never end, sit– And now, at Hogwarts, terrible things are to happen, are perhaps happening already, and Dobby cannot let Harry Potter stay here now that history is to repeat itself, now that the Chamber of Secrets is open once more.\" Dobby froze, horrorstruck, then grabbed Harry\\'s water jug from his bedside table and cracked it over his own head, toppling out of sight. A second later, he crawled back onto the bed, cross-eyed, muttering, \"Bad Dobby, very bad Dobby–\" \"So there is a Chamber of Secrets?\" Harry whispered. \"And did you say it\\'s been opened before? Tell me, Dobby!\" He seized the elf\\'s bony wrist as Dobby\\'s hand inched toward the water jug. \"But I\\'m not Muggle-born - how can I be in danger from the Chamber?\" \"Ah, sir, ask no more, ask no more of poor Dobby,\" stammered the elf, his eyes huge in the dark. \"Dark deeds are planned in this place, but Harry Potter must not be here when they happen - go home, Harry Potter, go home. Harry Potter must not meddle in this, sir, ‚tis too dangerous - \" \"Who is it, Dobby?\" Harry said, keeping a firm hold on Dobby\\'s wrist to stop him from hitting himself with the water jug again. \"Who\\'s opened it? Who opened it last time?\" \"Dobby can\\'t, sir, Dobby can\\'t, Dobby mustn\\'t tell!\" squealed the elf. \"Go home, Harry Potter, go home!\" \"I\\'m not going anywhere!\" said Harry fiercely. \"One of my best friends is Muggle-born; she\\'ll be first in line if the Chamber really has been opened - \" \"Harry Potter risks his own life for his friends!\" moaned Dobby in a kind of miserable ecstasy. \"So noble! So valiant! But he must save himself, he must, Harry Potter must not - \" Dobby suddenly froze, his bat ears quivering. Harry heard it, too. There were footsteps coming down the passageway outside. \"Dobby must go!\" breathed the elf, terrified. There was a loud crack, and Harry\\'s fist was suddenly clenched on thin air. He slumped back into bed, his eyes on the dark doorway to the hospital wing as the footsteps drew nearer. Next moment, Dumbledore was backing into the dormitory, wearing a long woolly dressing gown and a nightcap. He was carrying one end of what looked like a statue. Professor McGonagall appeared a second later, carrying its feet. Together, they heaved it onto a bed. \"Get Madam Pomfrey,\" whispered Dumbledore, and Professor McGonagall hurried past the end of Harry\\'s bed out of sight. Harry lay quite still, pretending to be asleep. He heard urgent voices, and then Professor McGonagall swept back into view, closely followed by Madam Pomfrey, who was pulling a cardigan on over her nightdress. He heard a sharp intake of breath. \"What happened?\" Madam Pomfrey whispered to Dumbledore, bending over the statue on the bed. \"Another attack,\" said Dumbledore. \"Minerva found him on the stairs.\" \"There was a bunch of grapes next to him,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"We think he was trying to sneak up here to visit Potter.\" Harry\\'s stomach gave a horrible lurch. Slowly and carefully, he raised himself a few inches so he could look at the statue on the bed. A ray of moonlight lay across its staring face. It was Colin Creevey. His eyes were wide and his hands were stuck up in front of him, holding his camera. \"Petrified?\" whispered Madam Pomfrey. \"Yes,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"But I shudder to think– If Albus hadn\\'t been on the way downstairs for hot chocolate - who knows what might have - \" The three of them stared down at Colin. Then Dumbledore leaned forward and wrenched the camera out of Colin\\'s rigid grip. \"You don\\'t think he managed to get a picture of his attacker?\" said Professor McGonagall eagerly. Dumbledore didn\\'t answer. He opened the back of the camera. \"Good gracious!\" said Madam Pomfrey. A jet of steam had hissed out of the camera. Harry, three beds away, caught the acrid smell of burnt plastic. \"Melted,\" said Madam Pomfrey wonderingly. \"All melted–\" \"What does this mean, Albus?\" Professor McGonagall asked urgently. \"It means,\" said Dumbledore, \"that the Chamber of Secrets is indeed open again.\" Madam Pomfrey clapped a hand to her mouth. Professor McGonagall stared at Dumbledore. \"But, Albus– surely– who?\" \"The question is not who,\" said Dumbledore, his eyes on Colin. \"The question is, how–\" And from what Harry could see of Professor McGonagall\\'s shadowy face, she didn\\'t understand this any better than he did. CHAPTER ELEVEN The Dueling Club Harry woke up on Sunday morning to find the dormitory blazing with winter sunlight and his arm reboned but very stiff. He sat up quickly and looked over at Colin\\'s bed, but it had been blocked from view by the high curtains Harry had changed behind yesterday. Seeing that he was awake, Madam Pomfrey came bustling over with a breakfast tray and then began bending and stretching his arm and fingers. \"All in order,\" she said as he clumsily fed himself porridge left-handed. \"When you\\'ve finished eating, you may leave.\" Harry dressed as quickly as he could and hurried off to Gryffindor Tower, desperate to tell Ron and Hermione about Colin and Dobby, but they weren\\'t there. Harry left to look for them, wondering where they could have got to and feeling slightly hurt that they weren\\'t interested in whether he had his bones back or not. As Harry passed the library, Percy Weasley strolled out of it, looking in far better spirits than last time they\\'d met. \"Oh, hello, Harry,\" he said. \"Excellent flying yesterday, really excellent. Gryffindor has just taken the lead for the House Cup - you earned fifty points!\" \"You haven\\'t seen Ron or Hermione, have you?\" said Harry. \"No, I haven\\'t,\" said Percy, his smile fading. \"I hope Ron\\'s not in another girls\\' toilet–\" Harry forced a laugh, watched Percy walk out of sight, and then headed straight for Moaning Myrtle\\'s bathroom. He couldn\\'t see why Ron and Hermione would be in there again, but after making sure that neither Filch nor any prefects were around, he opened the door and heard their voices coming from a locked stall. \"It\\'s me,\" he said, closing the door behind him. There was a clunk, a splash, and a gasp from within the stall and he saw Hermione\\'s eye peering through the keyhole. \"Harry!\" she said. \"You gave us such a fright - come in. How\\'s your arm?\" \"Fine,\" said Harry, squeezing into the stall. An old cauldron was perched on the toilet, and a crackling from under the rim told Harry they had lit a fire beneath it. Conjuring up portable, waterproof fires was a speciality of Hermione\\'s. \"We\\'d\\'ve come to meet you, but we decided to get started on the Polyjuice Potion,\" Ron explained as Harry, with difficulty, locked the stall again. \"We\\'ve decided this is the safest place to hide it.\" Harry started to tell them about Colin, but Hermione interrupted. \"We already know - we heard Professor McGonagall telling Professor Flitwick this morning. That\\'s why we decided we\\'d better get going - \" \"The sooner we get a confession out of Malfoy, the better,\" snarled Ron. \"D\\'you know what I think? He was in such a foul temper after the Quidditch match, he took it out on Colin.\" \"There\\'s something else,\" said Harry, watching Hermione tearing bundles of knotgrass and throwing them into the potion. \"Dobby came to visit me in the middle of the night.\" Ron and Hermione looked up, amazed. Harry told them everything Dobby had told him - or hadn\\'t told him. Hermione and Ron listened with their mouths open. \"The Chamber of Secrets has been opened before?\" Hermione said. \"This settles it,\" said Ron in a triumphant voice. \"Lucius Malfoy must\\'ve opened the Chamber when he was at school here and now he\\'s told dear old Draco how to do it. It\\'s obvious. Wish Dobby\\'d told you what kind of monster\\'s in there, though. I want to know how come nobody\\'s noticed it sneaking around the school.\" \"Maybe it can make itself invisible,\" said Hermione, prodding leeches to the bottom of the cauldron. \"Or maybe it can disguise itself - pretend to be a suit of armor or something - I\\'ve read about Chameleon Ghouls - \" \"You read too much, Hermione,\" said Ron, pouring dead lacewings on top of the leeches. He crumpled up the empty lacewing bag and looked at Harry. \"So Dobby stopped us from getting on the train and broke your arm.\" He shook his head. \"You know what, Harry? If he doesn\\'t stop trying to save your life he\\'s going to kill you.\" The news that Colin Creevey had been attacked and was now lying as though dead in the hospital wing had spread through the entire school by Monday morning. The air was suddenly thick with rumor and suspicion. The first years were now moving around the castle in tight-knit groups, as though scared they would be attacked if they ventured forth alone. Ginny Weasley, who sat next to Colin Creevey in Charms, was distraught, but Harry felt that Fred and George were going the wrong way about cheering her up. They were taking turns covering themselves with fur or boils and jumping out at her from behind statues. They only stopped when Percy, apoplectic with rage, told them he was going to write to Mrs. Weasley and tell her Ginny was having nightmares. Meanwhile, hidden from the teachers, a roaring trade in talismans, amulets, and other protective devices was sweeping the school. Neville Longbottom bought a large, evil-smelling green onion, a pointed purple crystal, and a rotting newt tail before the other Gryffindor boys pointed out that he was in no danger; he was a pure-blood, and therefore unlikely to be attacked. \"They went for Filch first,\" Neville said, his round face fearful. \"And everyone knows I\\'m almost a Squib.\" In the second week of December Professor McGonagall came around as usual, collecting names of those who would be staying at school for Christmas. Harry, Ron, and Hermione signed her list; they had heard that Malfoy was staying, which struck them as very suspicious. The holidays would be the perfect time to use the Polyjuice Potion and try to worm a confession out of him. Unfortunately, the potion was only half finished. They still needed the bicorn horn and the boomslang skin, and the only place they were going to get them was from Snape\\'s private stores. Harry privately felt he\\'d rather face Slytherin\\'s legendary monster than let Snape catch him robbing his office. \"What we need,\" said Hermione briskly as Thursday afternoon\\'s double Potions lesson loomed nearer, \"is a diversion. Then one of us can sneak into Snape\\'s office and take what we need.\" Harry and Ron looked at her nervously. \"I think I\\'d better do the actual stealing,\" Hermione continued in a matter-of-fact tone. \"You two will be expelled if you get into any more trouble, and I\\'ve got a clean record. So all you need to do is cause enough mayhem to keep Snape busy for five minutes or so.\" Harry smiled feebly. Deliberately causing mayhem in Snape\\'s Potions class was about as safe as poking a sleeping dragon in the eye. Potions lessons took place in one of the large dungeons. Thursday afternoon\\'s lesson proceeded in the usual way. Twenty cauldrons stood steaming between the wooden desks, on which stood brass scales and jars of ingredients. Snape prowled through the fumes, making waspish remarks about the Gryffindors\\' work while the Slytherins sniggered appreciatively. Draco Malfoy, who was Snape\\'s favorite student, kept flicking puffer-fish eyes at Ron and Harry, who knew that if they retaliated they would get detention faster than you could say \"Unfair.\" Harry\\'s Swelling Solution was far too runny, but he had his mind on more important things. He was waiting for Hermione\\'s signal, and he hardly listened as Snape paused to sneer at his watery potion. When Snape turned and walked off to bully Neville, Hermione caught Harry\\'s eye and nodded. Harry ducked swiftly down behind his cauldron, pulled one of Fred\\'s Filibuster fireworks out of his pocket, and gave it a quick prod with his wand. The firework began to fizz and sputter. Knowing he had only seconds, Harry straightened up, took aim, and lobbed it into the air; it landed right on target in Goyle\\'s cauldron. Goyle\\'s potion exploded, showering the whole class. People shrieked as splashes of the Swelling Solution hit them. Malfoy got a faceful and his nose began to swell like a balloon; Goyle blundered around, his hands over his eyes, which had expanded to the size of a dinner plate - Snape was trying to restore calm and find out what had happened. Through the confusion, Harry saw Hermione slip quietly into Snape\\'s office. \"Silence! SILENCE!\" Snape roared. \"Anyone who has been splashed, come here for a Deflating Draft - when I find out who did this - \" Harry tried not to laugh as he watched Malfoy hurry forward, his head drooping with the weight of a nose like a small melon. As half the class lumbered up to Snape\\'s desk, some weighted down with arms like clubs, others unable to talk through gigantic puffed-up lips, Harry saw Hermione slide back into the dungeon, the front of her robes bulging. When everyone had taken a swig of antidote and the various swellings had subsided, Snape swept over to Goyle\\'s cauldron and scooped out the twisted black remains of the firework. There was a sudden hush. \"If I ever find out who threw this,\" Snape whispered, \"I shall make sure that person is expelled.\" Harry arranged his face into what he hoped was a puzzled expression. Snape was looking right at him, and the bell that rang ten minutes later could not have been more welcome. \"He knew it was me,\" Harry told Ron and Hermione as they hurried back to Moaning Myrtle\\'s bathroom. \"I could tell.\" Hermione threw the new ingredients into the cauldron and began to stir feverishly. \"It\\'ll be ready in two weeks,\" she said happily. \"Snape can\\'t prove it was you,\" said Ron reassuringly to Harry. \"What can he do?\" \"Knowing Snape, something foul,\" said Harry as the potion frothed and bubbled. A week later, Harry, Ron, and Hermione were walking across the entrance hall when they saw a small knot of people gathered around the notice board, reading a piece of parchment that had just been pinned up. Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas beckoned them over, looking excited. \"They\\'re starting a Dueling Club!\" said Seamus. \"First meeting tonight! I wouldn\\'t mind dueling lessons; they might come in handy one of these days–\" \"What, you reckon Slytherin\\'s monster can duel?\" said Ron, but he, too, read the sign with interest. \"Could be useful,\" he said to Harry and Hermione as they went into dinner. \"Shall we go?\" Harry and Hermione were all for it, so at eight o\\'clock that evening they hurried back to the Great Hall. The long dining tables had vanished and a golden stage had appeared along one wall, lit by thousands of candles floating overhead. The ceiling was velvety black once more and most of the school seemed to be packed beneath it, all carrying their wands and looking excited. \"I wonder who\\'ll be teaching us?\" said Hermione as they edged into the chattering crowd. \"Someone told me Flitwick was a dueling champion when he was young - maybe it\\'ll be him.\" \"As long as it\\'s not - \" Harry began, but he ended on a groan: Gilderoy Lockhart was walking onto the stage, resplendent in robes of deep plum and accompanied by none other than Snape, wearing his usual black. Lockhart waved an arm for silence and called \"Gather round, gather round! Can everyone see me? Can you all hear me? Excellent! \"Now, Professor Dumbledore has granted me permission to start this little dueling club, to train you all in case you ever need to defend yourselves as I myself have done on countless occasions - for full details, see my published works. \"Let me introduce my assistant, Professor Snape,\" said Lockhart, flashing a wide smile. \"He tells me he knows a tiny little bit about dueling himself and has sportingly agreed to help me with a short demonstration before we begin. Now, I don\\'t want any of you youngsters to worry - you\\'ll still have your Potions master when I\\'m through with him, never fear!\" \"Wouldn\\'t it be good if they finished each other off?\" Ron muttered in Harry\\'s ear. Snape\\'s upper lip was curling. Harry wondered why Lockhart was still smiling; if Snape had been looking at him like that he\\'d have been running as fast as he could in the opposite direction. Lockhart and Snape turned to face each other and bowed; at least, Lockhart did, with much twirling of his hands, whereas Snape jerked his head irritably. Then they raised their wands like swords in front of them. \"As you see, we are holding our wands in the accepted combative position,\" Lockhart told the silent crowd. \"On the count of three, we will cast our first spells. Neither of us will be aiming to kill, of course.\" \"I wouldn\\'t bet on that,\" Harry murmured, watching Snape baring his teeth. \"One - two - three - \" Both of them swung their wands above their heads and pointed them at their opponent; Snape cried: \"Expelliarmus!\" There was a dazzling flash of scarlet light and Lockhart was blasted off his feet: He flew backward off the stage, smashed into the wall, and slid down it to sprawl on the floor. Malfoy and some of the other Slytherins cheered. Hermione was dancing on tiptoes. \"Do you think he\\'s all right?\" she squealed through her fingers. \"Who cares?\" said Harry and Ron together. Lockhart was getting unsteadily to his feet. His hat had fallen off and his wavy hair was standing on end. \"Well, there you have it!\" he said, tottering back onto the platform. \"That was a Disarming Charm - as you see, I\\'ve lost my wand - ah, thank you, Miss Brown - yes, an excellent idea to show them that, Professor Snape, but if you don\\'t mind my saying so, it was very obvious what you were about to do. If I had wanted to stop you it would have been only too easy - however, I felt it would be instructive to let them see–\" Snape was looking murderous. Possibly Lockhart had noticed, because he said, \"Enough demonstrating! I\\'m going to come amongst you now and put you all into pairs. Professor Snape, if you\\'d like to help me - \" They moved through the crowd, matching up partners. Lockhart teamed Neville with Justin Finch-Fletchley, but Snape reached Harry and Ron first. \"Time to split up the dream team, I think,\" he sneered. \"Weasley, you can partner Finnigan. Potter - \" Harry moved automatically toward Hermione. \"I don\\'t think so,\" said Snape, smiling coldly. \"Mr. Malfoy, come over here. Let\\'s see what you make of the famous Potter. And you, Miss Granger - you can partner Miss Bulstrode.\" Malfoy strutted over, smirking. Behind him walked a Slytherin girl who reminded Harry of a picture he\\'d seen in Holidays with Hags. She was large and square and her heavy jaw jutted aggressively. Hermione gave her a weak smile that she did not return. \"Face your partners!\" called Lockhart, back on the platform. \"And bow!\" Harry and Malfoy barely inclined their heads, not taking their eyes off each other. \"Wands at the ready!\" shouted Lockhart. \"When I count to three, cast your charms to disarm your opponents - only to disarm them - we don\\'t want any accidents - one– two– three - \" Harry swung his wand high, but Malfoy had already started on \"two\": His spell hit Harry so hard he felt as though he\\'d been hit over the head with a saucepan. He stumbled, but everything still seemed to be working, and wasting no more time, Harry pointed his wand straight at Malfoy and shouted, \"Rictusempra!\" A jet of silver light hit Malfoy in the stomach and he doubled up, wheezing. \"I said disarm only!\" Lockhart shouted in alarm over the heads of the battling crowd, as Malfoy sank to his knees; Harry had hit him with a Tickling Charm, and he could barely move for laughing. Harry hung back, with a vague feeling it would be unsporting to bewitch Malfoy while he was on the floor, but this was a mistake; gasping for breath, Malfoy pointed his wand at Harry\\'s knees, choked, \"Tarantallegra!\" and the next second Harry\\'s legs began to jerk around out of his control in a kind of quickstep. \"Stop! Stop!\" screamed Lockhart, but Snape took charge. \"Finite Incantatem!\" he shouted; Harry\\'s feet stopped dancing, Malfoy stopped laughing, and they were able to look up. A haze of greenish smoke was hovering over the scene. Both Neville and Justin were lying on the floor, panting; Ron was holding up an ashen-faced Seamus, apologizing for whatever his broken wand had done; but Hermione and Millicent Bulstrode were still moving; Millicent had Hermione in a headlock and Hermione was whimpering in pain; both their wands lay forgotten on the floor. Harry leapt forward and pulled Millicent off. It was difficult: She was a lot bigger than he was. \"Dear, dear,\" said Lockhart, skittering through the crowd, looking at the aftermath of the duels. \"Up you go, Macmillan–\" \"Careful there, Miss Fawcett– Pinch it hard, it\\'ll stop bleeding in a second,\" \"I think I\\'d better teach you how to block unfriendly spells,\" said Lockhart, standing flustered in the midst of the hall. He glanced at Snape, whose black eyes glinted, and looked quickly away. \"Let\\'s have a volunteer pair - Longbottom and Finch-Fletchley, how about you - \" \"A bad idea, Professor Lockhart,\" said Snape, gliding over like a large and malevolent bat. \"Longbottom causes devastation with the simplest spells. We\\'ll be sending what\\'s left of Finch-Fletchley up to the hospital wing in a matchbox.\" Neville\\'s round, pink face went pinker. \"How about Malfoy and Potter?\" said Snape with a twisted smile. \"Excellent idea!\" said Lockhart, gesturing Harry and Malfoy into the middle of the hall as the crowd backed away to give them room. \"Now, Harry,\" said Lockhart. \"When Draco points his wand at you, you do this.\" He raised his own wand, attempted a complicated sort of wiggling action, and dropped it. Snape smirked as Lockhart quickly picked it up, saying, \"Whoops - my wand is a little overexcited - \" Snape moved closer to Malfoy, bent down, and whispered something in his ear. Malfoy smirked, too. Harry looked up nervously at Lockhart and said, \"Professor, could you show me that blocking thing again?\" \"Scared?\" muttered Malfoy, so that Lockhart couldn\\'t hear him. \"You wish,\" said Harry out of the corner of his mouth. Lockhart cuffed Harry merrily on the shoulder. \"Just do what I did, Harry!\" \"What, drop my wand?\" But Lockhart wasn\\'t listening. \"Three - two - one - go!\" he shouted. Malfoy raised his wand quickly and bellowed, \"Serpensortia!\" The end of his wand exploded. Harry watched, aghast, as a long black snake shot out of it, fell heavily onto the floor between them, and raised itself, ready to strike. There were screams as the crowd backed swiftly away, clearing the floor. \"Don\\'t move, Potter,\" said Snape lazily, clearly enjoying the sight of Harry standing motionless, eye to eye with the angry snake. \"I\\'ll get rid of it–\" \"Allow me!\" shouted Lockhart. He brandished his wand at the snake and there was a loud bang; the snake, instead of vanishing, flew ten feet into the air and fell back to the floor with a loud smack. Enraged, hissing furiously, it slithered straight toward Justin Finch-Fletchley and raised itself again, fangs exposed, poised to strike. Harry wasn\\'t sure what made him do it. He wasn\\'t even aware of deciding to do it. All he knew was that his legs were carrying him forward as though he was on casters and that he had shouted stupidly at the snake, \"Leave him alone!\" And miraculously - inexplicably - the snake slumped to the floor, docile as a thick, black garden hose, its eyes now on Harry. Harry felt the fear drain out of him. He knew the snake wouldn\\'t attack anyone now, though how he knew it, he couldn\\'t have explained. He looked up at Justin, grinning, expecting to see Justin looking relieved, or puzzled, or even grateful - but certainly not angry and scared. \"What do you think you\\'re playing at?\" he shouted, and before Harry could say anything, Justin had turned and stormed out of the hall. Snape stepped forward, waved his wand, and the snake vanished in a small puff of black smoke. Snape, too, was looking at Harry in an unexpected way: It was a shrewd and calculating look, and Harry didn\\'t like it. He was also dimly aware of an ominous muttering all around the walls. Then he felt a tugging on the back of his robes. \"Come on,\" said Ron\\'s voice in his ear. \"Move - come on - \" Ron steered him out of the hall, Hermione hurrying alongside them. As they went through the doors, the people on either side drew away as though they were frightened of catching something. Harry didn\\'t have a clue what was going on, and neither Ron nor Hermione explained anything until they had dragged him all the way up to the empty Gryffindor common room. Then Ron pushed Harry into an armchair and said, \"You\\'re a Parselmouth. Why didn\\'t you tell us?\" \"I\\'m a what?\" said Harry. \"A Parselmouth!\" said Ron. \"You can talk to snakes!\" \"I know,\" said Harry. \"I mean, that\\'s only the second time I\\'ve ever done it. I accidentally set a boa constrictor on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once - long story - but it was telling me it had never seen Brazil and I sort of set it free without meaning to that was before I knew I was a wizard - \" \"A boa constrictor told you it had never seen Brazil?\" Ron repeated faintly. \"So?\" said Harry. \"I bet loads of people here can do it.\" \"Oh, no they can\\'t,\" said Ron. \"It\\'s not a very common gift. Harry, this is bad.\" \"What\\'s bad?\" said Harry, starting to feel quite angry. \"What\\'s wrong with everyone? Listen, if I hadn\\'t told that snake not to attack Justin - \" \"Oh, that\\'s what you said to it?\" \"What d\\'you mean? You were there - you heard me - \" \"I heard you speaking Parseltongue,\" said Ron. \"Snake language. You could have been saying anything - no wonder Justin panicked, you sounded like you were egging the snake on or something - it was creepy, you know - \" Harry gaped at him. \"I spoke a different language? But - I didn\\'t realize - how can I speak a language without knowing I can speak it?\" Ron shook his head. Both he and Hermione were looking as though someone had died. Harry couldn\\'t see what was so terrible. \"D\\'you want to tell me what\\'s wrong with stopping a massive snake biting off Justin\\'s head?\" he said. \"What does it matter how I did it as long as Justin doesn\\'t have to join the Headless Hunt?\" \"It matters,\" said Hermione, speaking at last in a hushed voice, \"because being able to talk to snakes was what Salazar Slytherin was famous for. That\\'s why the symbol of Slytherin House is a serpent.\" Harry\\'s mouth fell open. \"Exactly,\" said Ron. \"And now the whole school\\'s going to think you\\'re his great-great-great-great-grandson or something - \" \"But I\\'m not,\" said Harry, with a panic he couldn\\'t quite explain. \"You\\'ll find that hard to prove,\" said Hermione. \"He lived about a thousand years ago; for all we know, you could be.\" Harry lay awake for hours that night. Through a gap in the curtains around his four-poster he watched snow starting to drift past the tower window and wondered– Could he be a descendant of Salazar Slithering? He didn\\'t know anything about his father\\'s family, after all. The Dursleys had always forbidden questions about his wizarding relatives. Quietly, Harry tried to say something in Parseltongue. The words wouldn\\'t come. It seemed he had to be face-to-face with a snake to do it. But I\\'m in Gryffindor, Harry thought. The Sorting Hat wouldn\\'t have put me in here if I had Slytherin blood– Ah, said a nasty little voice in his brain, but the Sorting Hat wanted to put you in Slytherin, don\\'t you remember? Harry turned over. He\\'d see Justin the next day in Herbology and he\\'d explain that he\\'d been calling the snake off, not egging it on, which (he thought angrily, pummeling his pillow) any fool should have realized. By next morning, however, the snow that had begun in the night had turned into a blizzard so thick that the last Herbology lesson of the term was canceled: Professor Sprout wanted to fit socks and scarves on the Mandrakes, a tricky operation she would entrust to no one else, now that it was so important for the Mandrakes to grow quickly and revive Mrs. Norris and Colin Creevey. Harry fretted about this next to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, while Ron and Hermione used their time off to play a game of wizard chess. \"For heaven\\'s sake, Harry,\" said Hermione, exasperated, as one of Ron\\'s bishops wrestled her knight off his horse and dragged him off the board. \"Go and find Justin if it\\'s so important to you.\" So Harry got up and left through the portrait hole, wondering where Justin might be. The castle was darker than it usually was in daytime because of the thick, swirling gray snow at every window. Shivering, Harry walked past classrooms where lessons were taking place, catching snatches of what was happening within. Professor McGonagall was shouting at someone who, by the sound of it, had turned his friend into a badger. Resisting the urge to take a look, Harry walked on by, thinking that Justin might be using his free time to catch up on some work, and deciding to check the library first. A group of the Hufflepuffs who should have been in Herbology were indeed sitting at the back of the library, but they didn\\'t seem to be working. Between the long lines of high bookshelves, Harry could see that their heads were close together and they were having what looked like an absorbing conversation. He couldn\\'t see whether Justin was among them. He was walking toward them when something of what they were saying met his ears, and he paused to listen, hidden in the Invisibility section. \"So anyway,\" a stout boy was saying, \"I told Justin to hide up in our dormitory. I mean to say, if Potter\\'s marked him down as his next victim, it\\'s best if he keeps a low profile for a while. Of course, Justin\\'s been waiting for something like this to happen ever since he let slip to Potter he was Muggle-born. Justin actually told him he\\'d been down for Eton. That\\'s not the kind of thing you bandy about with Slytherin\\'s heir on the loose, is it?\" \"You definitely think it is Potter, then, Ernie?\" said a girl with blonde pigtails anxiously. \"Hannah,\" said the stout boy solemnly, \"he\\'s a Parselmouth. Everyone knows that\\'s the mark of a Dark wizard. Have you ever heard of a decent one who could talk to snakes? They called Slytherin himself Serpent-tongue.\" There was some heavy murmuring at this, and Ernie went on, \"Remember what was written on the wall? Enemies of the Heir, Beware. Potter had some sort of run-in with Filch. Next thing we know, Filch\\'s cat\\'s attacked. That first year, Creevey, was annoying Potter at the Quidditch match, taking pictures of him while he was lying in the mud. Next thing we know - Creevey\\'s been attacked.\" \"He always seems so nice, though,\" said Hannah uncertainly, \"and, well, he\\'s the one who made You-Know-Who disappear. He can\\'t be all bad, can he?\" Ernie lowered his voice mysteriously, the Hufflepuffs bent closer, and Harry edged nearer so that he could catch Ernie\\'s words. \"No one knows how he survived that attack by You-Know-Who. I mean to say, he was only a baby when it happened. He should have been blasted into smithereens. Only a really powerful Dark wizard could have survived a curse like that.\" He dropped his voice until it was barely more than a whisper, and said, \"That\\'s probably why You- Know-Who wanted to kill him in the first place. Didn\\'t want another Dark Lord competing with him. I wonder what other powers Potter\\'s been hiding?\" Harry couldn\\'t take anymore. Clearing his throat loudly, he stepped out from behind the bookshelves. If he hadn\\'t been feeling so angry, he would have found the sight that greeted him funny: Every one of the Hufflepuffs looked as though they had been Petrified by the sight of him, and the color was draining out of Ernie\\'s face. \"Hello,\" said Harry. \"I\\'m looking for Justin Finch-Fletchley.\" The Hufflepuffs\\' worst fears had clearly been confirmed. They all looked fearfully at Ernie. \"What do you want with him?\" said Ernie in a quavering voice. \"I wanted to tell him what really happened with that snake at the Dueling Club,\" said Harry. Ernie bit his white lips and then, taking a deep breath, said, \"We were all there. We saw what happened.\" \"Then you noticed that after I spoke to it, the snake backed off?\" said Harry. \"All I saw,\" said Ernie stubbornly, though he was trembling as he spoke, \"was you speaking Parseltongue and chasing the snake toward Justin.\" \"I didn\\'t chase it at him!\" Harry said, his voice shaking with anger. \"It didn\\'t even touch him!\" \"It was a very near miss,\" said Ernie. \"And in case you\\'re getting ideas,\" he added hastily, \"I might tell you that you can trace my family back through nine generations of witches and warlocks and my blood\\'s as pure as anyone\\'s, so - \" \"- I don\\'t care what sort of blood you\\'ve got!\" said Harry fiercely. \"Why would I want to attack Muggle-borns?\" \"I\\'ve heard you hate those Muggles you live with,\" said Ernie swiftly. \"It\\'s not possible to live with the Dursleys and not hate them,\" said Harry. \"I\\'d like to see you try it.\" He turned on his heel and stormed out of the library, earning himself a reproving glare from Madam Pince, who was polishing the gilded cover of a large spellbook. Harry blundered up the corridor, barely noticing where he was going, he was in such a fury. The result was that he walked into something very large and solid, which knocked him backward onto the floor. \"Oh, hello, Hagrid,\" Harry said, looking up. Hagrid\\'s face was entirely hidden by a woolly, snow-covered balaclava, but it couldn\\'t possibly be anyone else, as he filled most of the corridor in his moleskin overcoat. A dead rooster was hanging from one of his massive, gloved hands. \"All righ\\', Harry?\" he said, pulling up the balaclava so he could speak. \"Why aren\\'t yeh in class?\" \"Canceled,\" said Harry, getting up. \"What\\'re you doing in here?\" Hagrid held up the limp rooster. \"Second one killed this term,\" he explained. \"It\\'s either foxes or a Blood-Suckin Bugbear, an\\' I need the Headmaster\\'s permission ter put a charm around the hen coop.\" He peered more closely at Harry from under his thick, snowflecked eyebrows. \"Yeh sure yeh\\'re all righ\\'? Yeh look all hot an\\' bothered - \" Harry couldn\\'t bring himself to repeat what Ernie and the rest of the Hufflepuffs had been saying about him. \"It\\'s nothing,\" he said. \"I\\'d better get going, Hagrid, it\\'s Transfiguration next and I\\'ve got to pick up my books.\" He walked off, his mind still full of what Ernie had said about him. \"Justin\\'s been waiting for something like this to happen ever since he let slip to Potter he was Muggle-born–\" Harry stamped up the stairs and turned along another corridor, which was particularly dark; the torches had been extinguished by a strong, icy draft that was blowing through a loose windowpane. He was halfway down the passage when he tripped headlong over something lying on the floor. He turned to squint at what he\\'d fallen over and felt as though his stomach had dissolved. Justin Finch-Fletchley was lying on the floor, rigid and cold, a look of shock frozen on his face, his eyes staring blankly at the ceiling. And that wasn\\'t all. Next to him was another figure, the strangest sight Harry had ever seen. It was Nearly Headless Nick, no longer pearly-white and transparent, but black and smoky, floating immobile and horizontal, six inches off the floor. His head was half off and his face wore an expression of shock identical to Justin\\'s. Harry got to his feet, his breathing fast and shallow, his heart doing a kind of drumroll against his ribs. He looked wildly up and down the deserted corridor and saw a line of spiders scuttling as fast as they could away from the bodies. The only sounds were the muffled voices of teachers from the classes on either side. He could run, and no one would ever know he had been there. But he couldn\\'t just leave them lying here– He had to get help– Would anyone believe he hadn\\'t had anything to do with this? As he stood there, panicking, a door right next to him opened with a bang. Peeves the Poltergeist came shooting out. \"Why, it\\'s potty wee Potter!\" cackled Peeves, knocking Harry\\'s glasses askew as he bounced past him. \"What\\'s Potter up to? Why\\'s Potter lurking - \" Peeves stopped, halfway through a midair somersault. Upside down, he spotted Justin and Nearly Headless Nick. He flipped the right way up, filled his lungs and, before Harry could stop him, screamed, \"ATTACK! ATTACK! ANOTHER ATTACK! NO MORTAL OR GHOST IS SAFE! RUN FOR YOUR LIVES! ATTAAAACK!\" Crash - crash - crash - door after door flew open along the corridor and people flooded out. For several long minutes, there was a scene of such confusion that Justin was in danger of being squashed and people kept standing in Nearly Headless Nick. Harry found himself pinned against the wall as the teachers shouted for quiet. Professor McGonagall came running, followed by her own class, one of whom still had black-and-white-striped hair. She used her wand to set off a loud bang, which restored silence, and ordered everyone back into their classes. No sooner had the scene cleared somewhat than Ernie the Hufflepuff arrived, panting, on the scene. \"Caught in the act!\" Ernie yelled, his face stark white, pointing his finger dramatically at Harry. \"That will do, Macmillan!\" said Professor McGonagall sharply. Peeves was bobbing overhead, now grinning wickedly, surveying the scene; Peeves always loved chaos. As the teachers bent over Justin and Nearly Headless Nick, examining them, Peeves broke into song: \"Oh, Potter, you rotter, oh, what have you done, You\\'re killing off\\' students, you think it\\'s good fun - \" \"That\\'s enough Peeves!\" barked Professor McGonagall, and Peeves zoomed away backward, with his tongue out at Harry. Justin was carried up to the hospital wing by Professor Flitwick and Professor Sinistra of the Astronomy department, but nobody seemed to know what to do for Nearly Headless Nick. In the end, Professor McGonagall conjured a large fan out of thin air, which she gave to Ernie with instructions to waft Nearly Headless Nick up the stairs. This Ernie did, fanning Nick along like a silent black hovercraft. This left Harry and Professor McGonagall alone together. \"This way, Potter,\" she said. \"Professor,\" said Harry at once, \"I swear I didn\\'t - \" \"This is out of my hands, Potter,\" said Professor McGonagall curtly. They marched in silence around a corner and she stopped before a large and extremely ugly stone gargoyle. \"Lemon drop!\" she said. This was evidently a password, because the gargoyle sprang suddenly to life and hopped aside as the wall behind him split in two. Even full of dread for what was coming, Harry couldn\\'t fail to be amazed. Behind the wall was a spiral staircase that was moving smoothly upward, like an escalator. As he and Professor McGonagall stepped onto it, Harry heard the wall thud closed behind them. They rose upward in circles, higher and higher, until at last, slightly dizzy, Harry saw a gleaming oak door ahead, with a brass knocker in the shape of a griffin. He knew now where he was being taken. This must be where Dumbledore lived. CHAPTER TWELVE The Polyjuice Potion They stepped off the stone staircase at the top, and Professor McGonagall rapped on the door. It opened silently and they entered. Professor McGonagall told Harry to wait and left him there, alone. Harry looked around. One thing was certain: of all the teachers\\' offices Harry had visited so far this year, Dumbledore\\'s was by far the most interesting. If he hadn\\'t been scared out of his wits that he was about to be thrown out of school, he would have been very pleased to have a chance to look around it. It was a large and beautiful circular room, full of funny little noises. A number of curious silver instruments stood on spindle legged tables, whirring and emitting little puffs of smoke. The walls were covered with portraits of old headmasters and headmistresses, all of whom were snoozing gently in their frames. There was also an enormous, claw-footed desk, and, sitting on a shelf behind it, a shabby, tattered wizard\\'s hat - the Sorting Hat. Harry hesitated. He cast a wary eye around the sleeping witches and wizards on the walls. Surely it couldn\\'t hurt if he took the hat down and tried it on again? Just to see– just to make sure it had put him in the right House. He walked quietly around the desk, lifted the hat from its shelf, and lowered it slowly onto his head. It was much too large and slipped down over his eyes, just as it had done the last time he\\'d put it on. Harry stared at the black inside of the hat, waiting. Then a small voice said in his ear, \"Bee in your bonnet, Harry Potter?\" \"Er, yes,\" Harry muttered. \"Er - sorry to bother you - I wanted to ask - \" \"You\\'ve been wondering whether I put you in the right House,\" said the hat smartly. \"Yes– you were particularly difficult to place. But I stand by what I said before - \" Harry\\'s heart leapt - \"you would have done well in Slytherin - \" Harry\\'s stomach plummeted. He grabbed the point of the hat and pulled it off. It hung limply in his hand, grubby and faded. Harry pushed it back onto its shelf, feeling sick. \"You\\'re wrong,\" he said aloud to the still and silent hat. It didn\\'t move. Harry backed away, watching it. Then a strange, gagging noise behind him made him wheel around. He wasn\\'t alone after all. Standing on a golden perch behind the door was a decrepit-looking bird that resembled a half-plucked turkey. Harry stared at it and the bird looked balefully back, making its gagging noise again. Harry thought it looked very ill. Its eyes were dull and, even as Harry watched, a couple more feathers fell out of its tail. Harry was just thinking that all he needed was for Dumbledore\\'s pet bird to die while he was alone in the office with it, when the bird burst into flames. Harry yelled in shock and backed away into the desk. He looked feverishly around in case there was a glass of water somewhere but couldn\\'t see one; the bird, meanwhile, had become a fireball; it gave one loud shriek and next second there was nothing but a smoldering pile of ash on the floor. The office door opened. Dumbledore came in, looking very somber. \"Professor,\" Harry gasped. \"Your bird - I couldn\\'t do anything - he just caught fire - \" To Harry\\'s astonishment, Dumbledore smiled. \"About time, too,\" he said. \"He\\'s been looking dreadful for days; I\\'ve been telling him to get a move on.\" He chuckled at the stunned look on Harry\\'s face. \"Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry. Phoenixes burst into flame when it is time for them to die and are reborn from the ashes. Watch him–\" Harry looked down in time to see a tiny, wrinkled, newborn bird poke its head out of the ashes. It was quite as ugly as the old one. \"It\\'s a shame you had to see him on a Burning Day,\" said Dumbledore, seating himself behind his desk. \"He\\'s really very handsome most of the time, wonderful red and gold plumage. Fascinating creatures, phoenixes. They can carry immensely heavy loads, their tears have healing powers, and they make highly faithful pets.\" In the shock of Fawkes catching fire, Harry had forgotten what he was there for, but it all came back to him as Dumbledore settled himself in the high chair behind the desk and fixed Harry with his penetrating, light-blue stare. Before Dumbledore could speak another word, however, the door of the office flew open with an almighty bang and Hagrid burst in, a wild look in his eyes, his balaclava perched on top of his shaggy black head and the dead rooster still swinging from his hand. \"It wasn\\' Harry, Professor Dumbledore!\" said Hagrid urgently. \"I was talkin\\' ter him seconds before that kid was found, he never had time, sir - \" Dumbledore tried to say something, but Hagrid went ranting on, waving the rooster around in his agitation, sending feathers everywhere. \"it can\\'t\\'ve bin him, I\\'ll swear it in front o\\' the Ministry o\\' Magic if I have to.\" \"Hagrid, I - \" \" - yeh\\'ve got the wrong boy, sir, I know Harry never - \" \"Hagrid!\" said Dumbledore loudly. \"I do not think that Harry attacked those people.\" \"Oh,\" said Hagrid, the rooster falling limply at his side. \"Right. I\\'ll wait outside then, Headmaster.\" And he stomped out looking embarrassed. \"You don\\'t think it was me, Professor?\" Harry repeated hopefully as Dumbledore brushed rooster feathers off his desk. \"No, Harry, I don\\'t,\" said Dumbledore, though his face was somber again. \"But I still want to talk to you.\" Harry waited nervously while Dumbledore considered him, the tips of his long fingers together. \"I must ask you, Harry, whether there is anything you\\'d like to tell me,\" he said gently. \"Anything at all.\" Harry didn\\'t know what to say. He thought of Malfoy shouting, \"You\\'ll be next, Mudbloods!\" and of the Polyjuice Potion simmering away in Moaning Myrtle\\'s bathroom. Then he thought of the disembodied voice he had heard twice and remembered what Ron had said: \"Hearing voices no one else can hear isn\\'t a good sign, even in the wizarding world.\" He thought, too, about what everyone was saying about him, and his growing dread that he was somehow connected with Salazar Slytherin– \"No,\" said Harry. \"There isn\\'t anything, Professor–\" The double attack on Justin and Nearly Headless Nick turned what had hitherto been nervousness into real panic. Curiously, it was Nearly Headless Nick\\'s fate that seemed to worry people most. What could possibly do that to a ghost? people asked each other; what terrible power could harm someone who was already dead? There was almost a stampede to book seats on the Hogwarts Express so that students could go home for Christmas. \"At this rate, we\\'ll be the only ones left,\" Ron told Harry and Hermione. \"Us, Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle. What a jolly holiday it\\'s going to be.\" Crabbe and Goyle, who always did whatever Malfoy did, had signed up to stay over the holidays, too. But Harry was glad that most people were leaving. He was tired of people skirting around him in the corridors, as though he was about to sprout fangs or spit poison; tired of all the muttering, pointing, and hissing as he passed. Fred and George, however, found all this very funny. They went out of their way to march ahead of Harry down the corridors, shouting, \"Make way for the Heir of Slytherin, seriously evil wizard coming through–\" Percy was deeply disapproving of this behavior. \"It is not a laughing matter,\" he said coldly. \"Oh, get out of the way, Percy,\" said Fred. \"Harry\\'s in a hurry.\" \"Yeah, he\\'s off to the Chamber of Secrets for a cup of tea with his fanged servant,\" said George, chortling. Ginny didn\\'t find it amusing either. \"Oh, don\\'t,\" she wailed every time Fred asked Harry loudly who he was planning to attack next, or when George pretended to ward Harry off with a large clove of garlic when they met. Harry didn\\'t mind; it made him feel better that Fred and George, at least, thought the idea of his being Slytherin\\'s heir was quite ludicrous. But their antics seemed to be aggravating Draco Malfoy, who looked increasingly sour each time he saw them at it. \"It\\'s because he\\'s bursting to say it\\'s really him,\" said Ron knowingly. \"You know how he hates anyone beating him at anything, and you\\'re getting all the credit for his dirty work.\" \"Not for long,\" said Hermione in a satisfied tone. \"The Polyjuice Potion\\'s nearly ready. We\\'ll be getting the truth out of him any day now.\" At last the term ended, and a silence deep as the snow on the grounds descended on the castle. Harry found it peaceful, rather than gloomy, and enjoyed the fact that he, Hermione, and the Weasleys had the run of Gryffindor Tower, which meant they could play Exploding Snap loudly without bothering anyone, and practice dueling in private. Fred, George, and Ginny had chosen to stay at school rather than visit Bill in Egypt with Mr. and Mrs. Weasley. Percy, who disapproved of what he termed their childish behavior, didn\\'t spend much time in the Gryffindor common room. He had already told them pompously that he was only staying over Christmas because it was his duty as a prefect to support the teachers during this troubled time. Christmas morning dawned, cold and white. Harry and Ron, the only ones left in their dormitory, were woken very early by Hermione, who burst in, fully dressed and carrying presents for them both. \"Wake up,\" she said loudly, pulling back the curtains at the window. \"Hermione - you\\'re not supposed to be in here - \" said Ron, shielding his eyes against the light. \"Merry Christmas to you, too,\" said Hermione, throwing him his present. \"I\\'ve been up for nearly an hour, adding more lacewings to the potion. It\\'s ready.\" Harry sat up, suddenly wide awake. \"Are you sure?\" \"Positive,\" said Hermione, shifting Scabbers the rat so that she could sit down on the end of Ron\\'s four-poster. \"If we\\'re going to do it, I say it should be tonight.\" At that moment, Hedwig swooped into the room, carrying a very small package in her beak. \"Hello,\" said Harry happily as she landed on his bed. \"Are you speaking to me again?\" She nibbled his ear in an affectionate sort of way, which was a far better present than the one that she had brought him, which turned out to be from the Dursleys. They had sent Harry a toothpick and a note telling him to find out whether he\\'d be able to stay at Hogwarts for the summer vacation, too. The rest of Harry\\'s Christmas presents were far more satisfactory. Hagrid had sent him a large tin of treacle fudge, which Harry decided to soften by the fire before eating; Ron had given him a book called Flying with the Cannons, a book of interesting facts about his favorite Quidditch team, and Hermione had bought him a luxurious eagle-feather quill. Harry opened the last present to find a new, hand-knitted sweater from Mrs. Weasley and a large plum cake. He read her card with a fresh surge of guilt, thinking about Mr. Weasley\\'s car (which hadn\\'t been seen since its crash with the Whomping Willow), and the bout of rule-breaking he and Ron were planning next. No one, not even someone dreading taking Polyjuice Potion later, could fail to enjoy Christmas dinner at Hogwarts. The Great Hall looked magnificent. Not only were there a dozen frost-covered Christmas trees and thick streamers of holly and mistletoe crisscrossing the ceiling, but enchanted snow was falling, warm and dry, from the ceiling. Dumbledore led them in a few of his favorite carols, Hagrid booming more and more loudly with every goblet of eggnog he consumed. Percy, who hadn\\'t noticed that Fred had bewitched his prefect badge so that it now read \"Pinhead,\" kept asking them all what they were sniggering at. Harry didn\\'t even care that Draco Malfoy was making loud, snide remark about his new sweater from the Slytherin table. With a bit of luck, Malfoy would be getting his comeuppance in a few hours\\' time. Harry and Ron had barely finished their third helpings of Christmas pudding when Hermione ushered them out of the hall to finalize their plans for the evening. \"We still need a bit of the people you\\'re changing into,\" said Hermione matter-of-factly, as though she were sending them to the supermarket for laundry detergent. \"And obviously, it\\'ll be best if you can get something of Crabbe\\'s and Goyle\\'s; they\\'re Malfoys best friends, he\\'ll tell them anything. And we also need to make sure the real Crabbe and Goyle can\\'t burst in on us while we\\'re interrogating him. \"I\\'ve got it all worked out,\" she went on smoothly, ignoring Harry\\'s and Ron\\'s stupefied faces. She held up two plump chocolate cakes. \"I\\'ve filled these with a simple Sleeping Draught. All you have to do is make sure Crabbe and Goyle find them. You know how greedy they are, they\\'re bound to eat them. Once they\\'re asleep, pull out a few of their hairs and hide them in a broom closet.\" Harry and Ron looked incredulously at each other. \"Hermione, I don\\'t think - \" \"That could go seriously wrong - \" But Hermione had a steely glint in her eye not unlike the one Professor McGonagall sometimes had. \"The potion will be useless without Crabbe\\'s and Goyle\\'s hair,\" she said sternly. \"You do want to investigate Malfoy, don\\'t you?\" \"Oh, all right, all right,\" said Harry. \"But what about you? Whose hair are you ripping out?\" \"I\\'ve already got mine!\" said Hermione brightly, pulling a tiny bottle out of her pocket and showing them the single hair inside it. \"Remember Millicent Bulstrode wrestling with me at the Dueling Club? She left this on my robes when she was trying to strangle me! And she\\'s gone home for Christmas - so I\\'ll just have to tell the Slytherins I\\'ve decided to come back.\" When Hermione had bustled off to check on the Polyjuice Potion again, Ron turned to Harry with a doom-laden expression. \"Have you ever heard of a plan where so many things could go wrong?\" But to Harry\\'s and Ron\\'s utter amazement, stage one of the operation went just as smoothly as Hermione had said. They lurked in the deserted entrance hall after Christmas tea, waiting for Crabbe and Goyle who had remained alone at the Slytherin table, shoveling down fourth helpings of trifle. Harry had perched the chocolate cakes on the end of the banisters. When they spotted Crabbe and Goyle coming out of the Great Hall, Harry and Ron hid quickly behind a suit of armor next to the front door. \"How thick can you get?\" Ron whispered ecstatically as Crabbe gleefully pointed out the cakes to Goyle and grabbed them. Grinning stupidly, they stuffed the cakes whole into their large mouths. For a moment, both of them chewed greedily, looks of triumph on their faces. Then, without the smallest change of expression, they both keeled over backward onto the floor. By far the hardest part was hiding them in the closet across the hall. Once they were safely stowed among the buckets and mops, Harry yanked out a couple of the bristles that covered Goyle\\'s forehead and Ron pulled out several of Crabbe\\'s hairs. They also stole their shoes, because their own were far too small for Crabbe - and Goyle-size feet. Then, still stunned at what they had just done, they sprinted up to Moaning Myrtle\\'s bathroom. They could hardly see for the thick black smoke issuing from the stall in which Hermione was stirring the cauldron. Pulling their robes up over their faces, Harry and Ron knocked softly on the door. \"Hermione?\" They heard the scrape of the lock and Hermione emerged, shiny-faced and looking anxious. Behind her they heard the gloop gloop of the bubbling, glutinous potion. Three glass tumblers stood ready on the toilet seat. \"Did you get them?\" Hermione asked breathlessly. Harry showed her Goyle\\'s hair. \"Good. And I sneaked these spare robes out of the laundry,\" Hermione said, holding up a small sack. \"You\\'ll need bigger sizes once you\\'re Crabbe and Goyle.\" The three of them stared into the cauldron. Close up, the potion looked like thick, dark mud, bubbling sluggishly. \"I\\'m sure I\\'ve done everything right,\" said Hermione, nervously rereading the splotched page of Moste Potente Potions. \"It looks like the book says it should– once we\\'ve drunk it, we\\'ll have exactly an hour before we change back into ourselves.\" \"Now what?\" Ron whispered. \"We separate it into three glasses and add the hairs.\" Hermione ladled large dollops of the potion into each of the glasses. Then, her hand trembling, she shook Millicent Bulstrode\\'s hair out of its bottle into the first glass. The potion hissed loudly like a boiling kettle and frothed madly. A second later, it had turned a sick sort of yellow. \"Urgh - essence of Millicent Bulstrode,\" said Ron, eyeing it with loathing. \"Bet it tastes disgusting.\" \"Add yours, then,\" said Hermione. Harry dropped Goyle\\'s hair into the middle glass and Ron put Crabbe\\'s into the last one. Both glasses hissed and frothed: Goyle\\'s turned the khaki color of a booger, Crabbe\\'s a dark, murky brown. \"Hang on,\" said Harry as Ron and Hermione reached for their glasses. \"We\\'d better not all drink them in here– Once we turn into Crabbe and Goyle we won\\'t fit. And Millicent Bulstrode\\'s no pixie.\" \"Good thinking,\" said Ron, unlocking the door. \"We\\'ll take separate stalls.\" Careful not to spill a drop of his Polyjuice Potion, Harry slipped into the middle stall. \"Ready?\" he called. \"Ready,\" came Ron\\'s and Hermione\\'s voices. \"One - two - three - \" Pinching his nose, Harry drank the potion down in two large gulps. It tasted like overcooked cabbage. Immediately, his insides started writhing as though he\\'d just swallowed live snakes - doubled up, he wondered whether he was going to be sick - then a burning sensation spread rapidly from his stomach to the very ends of his fingers and toes - next, bringing him gasping to all fours, came a horrible melting feeling, as the skin all over his body bubbled like hot wax - and before his eyes, his hands began to grow, the fingers thickened, the nails broadened, the knuckles were bulging like bolts - his shoulders stretched painfully and a prickling on his forehead told him that hair was creeping down toward his eyebrows - his robes ripped as his chest expanded like a barrel bursting its hoops - his feet were agony in shoes four sizes too small. As suddenly as it had started, everything stopped. Harry lay facedown on the stone-cold floor, listening to Myrtle gurgling morosely in the end toilet. With difficulty, he kicked off his shoes and stood up. So this was what it felt like, being Goyle. His large hand trembling, he pulled off his old robes, which were hanging a foot above his ankles, pulled on the spare ones, and laced up Goyle\\'s boatlike shoes. He reached up to brush his hair out of his eyes and met only the short growth of wiry bristles, low on his forehead. Then he realized that his glasses were clouding his eyes because Goyle obviously didn\\'t need them - he took them off and called, \"Are you two okay?\" Goyle\\'s low rasp of a voice issued from his mouth. \"Yeah,\" came the deep grunt of Crabbe from his right. Harry unlocked his door and stepped in front of the cracked mirror. Goyle stared back at him out of dull, deep-set eyes. Harry scratched his ear. So did Goyle. Ron\\'s door opened. They stared at each other. Except that he looked pale and shocked, Ron was indistinguishable from Crabbe, from the pudding-bowl haircut to the long, gorilla arms. \"This is unbelievable,\" said Ron, approaching the mirror and prodding Crabbe\\'s flat nose. \"Unbelievable.\" \"We\\'d better get going,\" said Harry, loosening the watch that was cutting into Goyle\\'s thick wrist. \"We\\'ve still got to find out where the Slytherin common room is. I only hope we can find someone to follow–\" Ron, who had been gazing at Harry, said, \"You don\\'t know how bizarre it is to see Goyle thinking.\" He banged on Hermione\\'s door. \"C\\'mon, we need to go - \" A high-pitched voice answered him. \"I - I don\\'t think I\\'m going to come after all. You go on without me.\" \"Hermione, we know Millicent Bulstrode\\'s ugly, no one\\'s going to know it\\'s you - \" \"No - really - I don\\'t think I\\'ll come. You two hurry up, you\\'re wasting time - \" Harry looked at Ron, bewildered. \"That looks more like Goyle,\" said Ron. \"That\\'s how he looks every time a teacher asks him a question.\" \"Hermione, are you okay?\" said Harry through the door. \"Fine - I\\'m fine - go on - \" Harry looked at his watch. Five of their precious sixty minutes had already passed. \"We\\'ll meet you back here, all right?\" he said. Harry and Ron opened the door of the bathroom carefully, checked that the coast was clear, and set off. \"Don\\'t swing your arms like that,\" Harry muttered to Ron. \"Eh?\" \"Crabbe holds them sort of stiff–\" \"How\\'s this?\" \"Yeah, that\\'s better–\" They went down the marble staircase. All they needed now was a Slytherin that they could follow to the Slytherin common room, but there was nobody around. \"Any ideas?\" muttered Harry. \"The Slytherins always come up to breakfast from over there,\" said Ron, nodding at the entrance to the dungeons. The words had barely left his mouth when a girl with long, curly hair emerged from the entrance. \"Excuse me,\" said Ron, hurrying up to her. \"We\\'ve forgotten the way to our common room.\" \"I beg your pardon?\" said the girl stiffly. \"Our common room? I\\'m a Ravenclaw.\" She walked away, looking suspiciously back at them. Harry and Ron hurried down the stone steps into the darkness, their footsteps echoing particularly loudly as Crabbe\\'s and Goyle\\'s huge feet hit the floor, feeling that this wasn\\'t going to be as easy as they had hoped. The labyrinthine passages were deserted. They walked deeper and deeper under the school, constantly checking their watches to see how much time they had left. After a quarter of an hour, just when they were getting desperate, they heard a sudden movement ahead. \"Ha!\" said Ron excitedly. \"There\\'s one of them now!\" The figure was emerging from a side room. As they hurried nearer, however, their hearts sank. It wasn\\'t a Slytherin, it was Percy. \"What\\'re you doing down here?\" said Ron in surprise. Percy looked affronted. \"That,\" he said stiffly, \"is none of your business. It\\'s Crabbe, isn\\'t it?\" \"Wh - oh, yeah,\" said Ron. \"Well, get off to your dormitories,\" said Percy sternly. \"It\\'s not safe to go wandering around dark corridors these days.\" \"You are,\" Ron pointed out. \"I,\" said Percy, drawing himself up, \"am a prefect. Nothing\\'s about to attack me.\" A voice suddenly echoed behind Harry and Ron. Draco Malfoy was strolling toward them, and for the first time in his life, Harry was pleased to see him. \"There you are,\" he drawled, looking at them. \"Have you two been pigging out in the Great Hall all this time? I\\'ve been looking for you; I want to show you something really funny.\" Malfoy glanced witheringly at Percy. \"And what\\'re you doing down here, Weasley?\" he sneered. Percy looked outraged. \"You want to show a bit more respect to a school prefect!\" he said. \"I don\\'t like your attitude!\" Malfoy sneered and motioned for Harry and Ron to follow him. Harry almost said something apologetic to Percy but caught himself just in time. He and Ron hurried after Malfoy, who said as they turned into the next passage, \"That Peter Weasley - \" \"Percy,\" Ron corrected him automatically. \"Whatever,\" said Malfoy. \"I\\'ve noticed him sneaking around a lot lately. And I bet I know what he\\'s up to. He thinks he\\'s going to catch Slytherin\\'s heir single-handed.\" He gave a short, derisive laugh. Harry and Ron exchanged excited looks. Malfoy paused by a stretch of bare, damp stone wall. \"What\\'s the new password again?\" he said to Harry. \"Er - \" said Harry. \"Oh, yeah - pure-blood!\" said Malfoy, not listening, and a stone door concealed in the wall slid open. Malfoy marched through it, and Harry and Ron followed him. The Slytherin common room was a long, low underground room with rough stone walls and ceiling from which round, greenish lamps were hanging on chains. A fire was crackling under an elaborately carved mantelpiece ahead of them, and several Slytherins were silhouetted around it in high-backed chairs. \"Wait here,\" said Malfoy to Harry and Ron, motioning them to a pair of empty chairs set back from the fire. \"I\\'ll go and get it my father\\'s just sent it to me - \" Wondering what Malfoy was going to show them, Harry and Ron sat down, doing their best to look at home. Malfoy came back a minute later, holding what looked like a newspaper clipping. He thrust it under Ron\\'s nose. \"That\\'ll give you a laugh,\" he said. Harry saw Ron\\'s eyes widen in shock. He read the clipping quickly, gave a very forced laugh, and handed it to Harry. It had been clipped out of the Daily Prophet, and it said: INQUIRY AT THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC Arthur Weasley, Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office, was today fined fifty Galleons for bewitching a Muggle car. Mr. Lucius Malfoy, a governor of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where the enchanted car crashed earlier this year, called today for Mr. Weasley\\'s resignation. \"Weasley has brought the Ministry into disrepute,\" Mr. Malfoy told our reporter. \"He is clearly unfit to draw up our laws and his ridiculous Muggle Protection Act should be scrapped immediately.\" Mr. Weasley was unavailable for comment, although his wife told reporters to clear off or she\\'d set the family ghoul on them. \"Well?\" said Malfoy impatiently as Harry handed the clipping back to him. \"Don\\'t you think it\\'s funny?\" \"Ha, ha,\" said Harry bleakly. \"Arthur Weasley loves Muggles so much he should snap his wand in half and go and join them,\" said Malfoy scornfully. \"You\\'d never know the Weasleys were pure-bloods, the way they behave.\" Ron\\'s - or rather, Crabbe\\'s - face was contorted with fury. \"What\\'s up with you, Crabbe?\" snapped Malfoy. \"Stomachache,\" Ron grunted. \"Well, go up to the hospital wing and give all those Mudbloods a kick from me,\" said Malfoy, snickering. \"You know, I\\'m surprised the Daily Prophet hasn\\'t reported all these attacks yet,\" he went on thoughtfully. \"I suppose Dumbledore\\'s trying to hush it all up. He\\'ll be sacked if it doesn\\'t stop soon. Father\\'s always said old Dumbledore\\'s the worst thing that\\'s ever happened to this place. He loves Muggle-borns. A decent headmaster would never\\'ve let slime like that Creevey in.\" Malfoy started taking pictures with an imaginary camera and did a cruel but accurate impression of Colin: \"‚Potter, can I have your picture, Potter? Can I have your autograph? Can I lick your shoes, please, Potter?\"\\' He dropped his hands and looked at Harry and Ron. \"What\\'s the matter with you two?\" Far too late, Harry and Ron forced themselves to laugh, but Malfoy seemed satisfied; perhaps Crabbe and Goyle were always slow on the uptake. \"Saint Potter, the Mudbloods\\' friend,\" said Malfoy slowly. \"He\\'s another one with no proper wizard feeling, or he wouldn\\'t go around with that jumped up Granger Mudblood. And people think he\\'s Slytherin\\'s heir!\" Harry and Ron waited with bated breath: Malfoy was surely seconds away from telling them it was him - but then \"I wish I knew who it is,\" said Malfoy petulantly. \"I could help them.\" Ron\\'s jaw dropped so that Crabbe looked even more clueless than usual. Fortunately, Malfoy didn\\'t notice, and Harry, thinking fast, said, \"You must have some idea who\\'s behind it all–\" \"You know I haven\\'t, Goyle, how many times do I have to tell you?\" snapped Malfoy. \"And Father won\\'t tell me anything about the last time the Chamber was opened either. Of course, it was fifty years ago, so it was before his time, but he knows all about it, and he says that it was all kept quiet and it\\'ll look suspicious if I know too much about it. But I know one thing - last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened, a Mudblood died. So I bet it\\'s a matter of time before one of them\\'s killed this time– I hope it\\'s Granger,\" he said with relish. Ron was clenching Crabbe\\'s gigantic fists. Feeling that it would be a bit of a giveaway if Ron punched Malfoy, Harry shot him a warning look and said, \"D\\'you know if the person who opened the Chamber last time was caught?\" \"Oh, yeah– whoever it was was expelled,\" said Malfoy. \"They\\'re probably still in Azkaban.\" \"Azkaban?\" said Harry, puzzled. \"Azkaban - the wizard prison, Goyle,\" said Malfoy, looking at him in disbelief \"Honestly, if you were any slower, you\\'d be going backward.\" He shifted restlessly in his chair and said, \"Father says to keep my head down and let the Heir of Slytherin get on with it. He says the school needs ridding of all the Mudblood filth, but not to get mixed up in it. Of course, he\\'s got a lot on his plate at the moment. You know the Ministry of Magic raided our manor last week?\" Harry tried to force Goyle\\'s dull face into a look of concern. \"Yeah–\" said Malfoy. \"Luckily, they didn\\'t find much. Father\\'s got some very valuable Dark Arts stuff. But luckily, we\\'ve got our own secret chamber under the drawing-room floor - \" \"Ho!\" said Ron. Malfoy looked at him. So did Harry. Ron blushed. Even his hair was turning red. His nose was also slowly lengthening - their hour was up, Ron was turning back into himself, and from the look of horror he was suddenly giving Harry, he must be, too. They both jumped to their feet. \"Medicine for my stomach,\" Ron grunted, and without further ado they sprinted the length of the Slytherin common room, hurled themselves at the stone wall, and dashed up the passage, hoping against hope that Malfoy hadn\\'t noticed anything. Harry could feel his feet slipping around in Goyle\\'s huge shoes and had to hoist up his robes as he shrank; they crashed up the steps into the dark entrance hall, which was full of a muffled pounding coming from the closet where they\\'d locked Crabbe and Goyle. Leaving their shoes outside the closet door, they sprinted in their socks up the marble staircase toward Moaning Myrtle\\'s bathroom. \"Well, it wasn\\'t a complete waste of time,\" Ron panted, closing the bathroom door behind them. \"I know we still haven\\'t found out who\\'s doing the attacks, but I\\'m going to write to Dad tomorrow and tell him to check under the Malfoys\\' drawing room.\" Harry checked his face in the cracked mirror. He was back to normal. He put his glasses on as Ron hammered on the door of Hermione\\'s stall. \"Hermione, come out, we\\'ve got loads to tell you - \" \"Go away!\" Hermione squeaked. Harry and Ron looked at each other. \"What\\'s the matter?\" said Ron. \"You must be back to normal by now, we are.\" But Moaning Myrtle glided suddenly through the stall door. Harry had never seen her looking so happy. \"Ooooooh, wait till you see,\" she said. \"It\\'s awful - \" They heard the lock slide back and Hermione emerged, sobbing, her robes pulled up over her head. \"What\\'s up?\" said Ron uncertainly. \"Have you still got Millicent\\'s nose or something?\" Hermione let her robes fall and Ron backed into the sink. Her face was covered in black fur. Her eyes had turned yellow and there were long, pointed ears poking through her hair. \"It was a c-cat hair!\" she howled. \"M-Millicent Bulstrode m-must have a cat! And the p-potion isn\\'t supposed to be used for animal transformations!\" \"Uh-oh,\" said Ron. \"You\\'ll be teased something dreadful,\" said Myrtle happily. \"It\\'s okay, Hermione,\" said Harry quickly. \"We\\'ll take you up to the hospital wing. Madam Pomfrey never asks too many questions–\" It took a long time to persuade Hermione to leave the bathroom. Moaning Myrtle sped them on their way with a hearty guffaw. \"Wait till everyone finds out you\\'ve got a tail!\" CHAPTER THIRTEEN The Very Secret Diary Hermione remained in the hospital wing for several weeks. There was a flurry of rumor about her disappearance when the rest of the school arrived back from their Christmas holidays, because of course everyone thought that she had been attacked. So many students filed past the hospital wing trying to catch a glimpse of her that Madam Pomfrey took out her curtains again and placed them around Hermione\\'s bed, to spare her the shame of being seen with a furry face. Harry and Ron went to visit her every evening. When the new term started, they brought her each day\\'s homework. \"If I\\'d sprouted whiskers, I\\'d take a break from work,\" said Ron, tipping a stack of books onto Hermione\\'s bedside table one evening. \"Don\\'t be silly, Ron, I\\'ve got to keep up,\" said Hermione briskly. Her spirits were greatly improved by the fact that all the hair had gone from her face and her eyes were turning slowly back to brown. \"I don\\'t suppose you\\'ve got any new leads?\" she added in a whisper, so that Madam Pomfrey couldn\\'t hear her. \"Nothing,\" said Harry gloomily. \"I was so sure it was Malfoy,\" said Ron, for about the hundredth time. \"What\\'s that?\" asked Harry, pointing to something gold sticking out from under Hermione\\'s pillow. \"Just a get well card,\" said Hermione hastily, trying to poke it out of sight, but Ron was too quick for her. He pulled it out, flicked it open, and read aloud: \"To Miss Granger, wishing you a speedy recovery, from your concerned teacher, Professor Gilderoy Lockhart, Order of Merlin, Third Class, Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defense League, and five-time winner of Witch Weekly\\'s Most Charming Smile Award.\" Ron looked up at Hermione, disgusted. \"You sleep with this under your pillow?\" But Hermione was spared answering by Madam Pomfrey sweeping over with her evening dose of medicine. \"Is Lockhart the smarmiest bloke you\\'ve ever met, or what?\" Ron said to Harry as they left the infirmary and started up the stairs toward Gryffindor Tower. Snape had given them so much homework, Harry thought he was likely to be in the sixth year before he finished it. Ron was just saying he wished he had asked Hermione how many rat tails you were supposed to add to a Hair Raising Potion when an angry outburst from the floor above reached their ears. \"That\\'s Filch,\" Harry muttered as they hurried up the stairs and paused, out of sight, listening hard. \"You don\\'t think someone else\\'s been attacked?\" said Ron tensely. They stood still, their heads inclined toward Flich\\'s voice, which sounded quite hysterical. \"Even more work for me! Mopping all night, like I haven\\'t got enough to do! No, this is the final straw, I\\'m going to Dumbledore - \" His footsteps receded along the out-of-sight corridor and they heard a distant door slam. They poked their heads around the corner. Filch had clearly been manning his usual lookout post: They were once again on the spot where Mrs. Norris had been attacked. They saw at a glance what Filch had been shouting about. A great flood of water stretched over half the corridor, and it looked as though it was still seeping from under the door of Moaning Myrtle\\'s bathroom. Now that Filch had stopped shouting, they could hear Myrtle\\'s wails echoing off the bathroom walls. \"Now what\\'s up with her?\" said Ron. \"Let\\'s go and see,\" said Harry, and holding their robes over their ankles they stepped through the great wash of water to the door bearing its OUT OF ORDER sign, ignored it as always, and entered. Moaning Myrtle was crying, if possible, louder and harder than ever before. She seemed to be hiding down her usual toilet. It was dark in the bathroom because the candles had been extinguished in the great rush of water that had left both walls and floor soaking wet. \"What\\'s up, Myrtle?\" said Harry. \"Who\\'s that?\" glugged Myrtle miserably. \"Come to throw something else at me?\" Harry waded across to her stall and said, \"Why would I throw something at you?\" \"Don\\'t ask me,\" Myrtle shouted, emerging with a wave of yet more water, which splashed onto the already sopping floor. \"Here I am, minding my own business, and someone thinks it\\'s funny to throw a book at me–\" \"But it can\\'t hurt you if someone throws something at you,\" said Harry, reasonably. \"I mean, it\\'d just go right through you, wouldn\\'t it?\" He had said the wrong thing. Myrtle puffed herself up and shrieked, \"Let\\'s all throw books at Myrtle, because she can\\'t feel it! Ten points if you can get it through her stomach! Fifty points if it goes through her head! Well, ha, ha, ha! What a lovely game, I don\\'t think!\" \"Who threw it at you, anyway?\" asked Harry. \"I don\\'t know– I was just sitting in the U-bend, thinking about death, and it fell right through the top of my head,\" said Myrtle, glaring at them. \"It\\'s over there, it got washed out–\" Harry and Ron looked under the sink where Myrtle was pointing. A small, thin book lay there. It had a shabby black cover and was as wet as everything else in the bathroom. Harry stepped forward to pick it up, but Ron suddenly flung out an arm to hold him back. \"What?\" said Harry. \"Are you crazy?\" said Ron. \"It could be dangerous.\" \"Dangerous?\" said Harry, laughing. \"Come off it, how could it be dangerous?\" \"You\\'d be surprised,\" said Ron, who was looking apprehensively at the book. \"Some of the books the Ministry\\'s confiscated Dad\\'s told me - there was one that burned your eyes out. And everyone who read Sonnets of a Sorcerer spoke in limericks for the rest of their lives. And some old witch in Bath had a book that you could never stop reading! You just had to wander around with your nose in it, trying to do everything one-handed. And - \" \"All right, I\\'ve got the point,\" said Harry. The little book lay on the floor, nondescript and soggy. \"Well, we won\\'t find out unless we look at it,\" he said, and he ducked around Ron and picked it up off the floor. Harry saw at once that it was a diary, and the faded year on the cover told him it was fifty years old. He opened it eagerly. On the first page he could just make out the name \"T M. Riddle\" in smudged ink. \"Hang on,\" said Ron, who had approached cautiously and was looking over Harry\\'s shoulder. \"I know that name– T. M. Riddle got an award for special services to the school fifty years ago.\" \"How on earth d\\'you know that?\" said Harry in amazement. \"Because Filch made me polish his shield about fifty times in detention,\" said Ron resentfully. \"That was the one I burped slugs all over. If you\\'d wiped slime off a name for an hour, you\\'d remember it, too.\" Harry peeled the wet pages apart. They were completely blank. There wasn\\'t the faintest trace of writing on any of them, not even Auntie Mabel\\'s birthday, or dentist, half-past three. \"He never wrote in it,\" said Harry, disappointed. \"I wonder why someone wanted to flush it away?\" said Ron curiously. Harry turned to the back cover of the book and saw the printed name of a variety store on Vauxhall Road, London. \"He must\\'ve been Muggle-born,\" said Harry thoughtfully. \"To have bought a diary from Vauxhall Road–\" \"Well, it\\'s not much use to you,\" said Ron. He dropped his voice. \"Fifty points if you can get it through Myrtle\\'s nose.\" Harry, however, pocketed it. Hermione left the hospital wing, de-whiskered, tail-less, and furfree, at the beginning of February. On her first evening back in Gryffindor Tower, Harry showed her T. M. Riddle\\'s diary and told her the story of how they had found it. \"Oooh, it might have hidden powers,\" said Hermione enthusiastically, taking the diary and looking at it closely. \"If it has, it\\'s hiding them very well,\" said Ron. \"Maybe it\\'s shy. I don\\'t know why you don\\'t chuck it, Harry.\" \"I wish I knew why someone did try to chuck it,\" said Harry. \"I wouldn\\'t mind knowing how Riddle got an award for special services to Hogwarts either.\" \"Could\\'ve been anything,\" said Ron. \"Maybe he got thirty O.W.L.s or saved a teacher from the giant squid. Maybe he murdered Myrtle; that would\\'ve done everyone a favor–\" But Harry could tell from the arrested look on Hermione\\'s face that she was thinking what he was thinking. \"What?\" said Ron, looking from one to the other. \"Well, the Chamber of Secrets was opened fifty years ago, wasn\\'t it?\" he said. \"That\\'s what Malfoy said.\" \"Yeah–\" said Ron slowly. \"And this diary is fifty years old,\" said Hermione, tapping it excitedly. \"So?\" \"Oh, Ron, wake up,\" snapped Hermione. \"We know the person who opened the Chamber last time was expelled fifty years ago. We know T. M. Riddle got an award for special services to the school fifty years ago. Well, what if Riddle got his special award for catching the Heir of Slytherin? His diary would probably tell us everything - where the Chamber is, and how to open it, and what sort of creature lives in it - the person who\\'s behind the attacks this time wouldn\\'t want that lying around, would they?\" \"That\\'s a brilliant theory, Hermione,\" said Ron, \"with just one tiny little flaw. There\\'s nothing written in his diary.\" But Hermione was pulling her wand out of her bag. \"It might be invisible ink!\" she whispered. She tapped the diary three times and said, \"Aparecium!\" Nothing happened. Undaunted, Hermione shoved her hand back into her bag and pulled out what appeared to be a bright red eraser. \"It\\'s a Revealer, I got it in Diagon Alley,\" she said. She rubbed hard on January first. Nothing happened. \"I\\'m telling you, there\\'s nothing to find in there,\" said Ron. \"Riddle just got a diary for Christmas and couldn\\'t be bothered filling it in.\" Harry couldn\\'t explain, even to himself, why he didn\\'t just throw Riddle\\'s diary away. The fact was that even though he knew the diary was blank, he kept absentmindedly picking it up and turning the pages, as though it were a story he wanted to finish. And while Harry was sure he had never heard the name T. M. Riddle before, it still seemed to mean something to him, almost as though Riddle was a friend he\\'d had when he was very small, and had half-forgotten. But this was absurd. He\\'d never had friends before Hogwarts, Dudley had made sure of that. Nevertheless, Harry was determined to find out more about Riddle, so next day at break, he headed for the trophy room to examine Riddle\\'s special award, accompanied by an interested Hermione and a thoroughly unconvinced Ron, who told them he\\'d seen enough of the trophy room to last him a lifetime. Riddle\\'s burnished gold shield was tucked away in a corner cabinet. It didn\\'t carry details of why it had been given to him (\"Good thing, too, or it\\'d be even bigger and I\\'d still be polishing it,\" said Ron). However, they did find Riddle\\'s name on an old Medal for Magical Merit, and on a list of old Head Boys. \"He sounds like Percy,\" said Ron, wrinkling his nose in disgust. \"Prefect, Head Boy– probably top of every class - \" \"You say that like it\\'s a bad thing,\" said Hermione in a slightly hurt voice. The sun had now begun to shine weakly on Hogwarts again. Inside the castle, the mood had grown more hopeful. There had been no more attacks since those on Justin and Nearly Headless Nick, and Madam Pomfrey was pleased to report that the Mandrakes were becoming moody and secretive, meaning that they were fast leaving childhood. \"The moment their acne clears up, they\\'ll be ready for repotting again,\" Harry heard her telling Filch kindly one afternoon. \"And after that, it won\\'t be long until we\\'re cutting them up and stewing them. You\\'ll have Mrs. Norris back in no time.\" Perhaps the Heir of Slytherin had lost his or her nerve, thought Harry. It must be getting riskier and riskier to open the Chamber of Secrets, with the school so alert and suspicious. Perhaps the monster, whatever it was, was even now settling itself down to hibernate for another fifty years– Ernie Macmillan of Hufflepuff didn\\'t take this cheerful view. He was still convinced that Harry was the guilty one, that he had \"given himself away\" at the Dueling Club. Peeves wasn\\'t helping matters; he kept popping up in the crowded corridors singing \"Oh, Potter, you rotter–\" now with a dance routine to match. Gilderoy Lockhart seemed to think he himself had made the attacks stop. Harry overheard him telling Professor McGonagall so while the Gryffindors were lining up for Transfiguration. \"I don\\'t think there\\'ll be any more trouble, Minerva,\" he said, tapping his nose knowingly and winking. \"I think the Chamber has been locked for good this time. The culprit must have known it was only a matter of time before I caught him. Rather sensible to stop now, before I came down hard on him. \"You know, what the school needs now is a morale-booster. Wash away the memories of last term! I won\\'t say any more just now, but I think I know just the thing–\" He tapped his nose again and strode off. Lockhart\\'s idea of a morale-booster became clear at breakfast time on February fourteenth. Harry hadn\\'t had much sleep because of a late-running Quidditch practice the night before, and he hurried down to the Great Hall, slightly late. He thought, for a moment, that he\\'d walked through the wrong doors. The walls were all covered with large, lurid pink flowers. Worse still, heart-shaped confetti was falling from the pale blue ceiling. Harry went over to the Gryffindor table, where Ron was sitting looking sickened, and Hermione seemed to have been overcome with giggles. \"What\\'s going on?\" Harry asked them, sitting down and wiping confetti off his bacon. Ron pointed to the teachers\\' table, apparently too disgusted to speak. Lockhart, wearing lurid pink robes to match the decorations, was waving for silence. The teachers on either side of him were looking stony-faced. From where he sat, Harry could see a muscle going in Professor McGonagall\\'s cheek. Snape looked as though someone had just fed him a large beaker of Skele-Gro. \"Happy Valentine\\'s Day!\" Lockhart shouted. \"And may I thank the forty-six people who have so far sent me cards! Yes, I have taken the liberty of arranging this little surprise for you all - and it doesn\\'t end here!\" Lockhart clapped his hands and through the doors to the entrance hall marched a dozen surly-looking dwarfs. Not just any dwarfs, however. Lockhart had them all wearing golden wings and carrying harps. \"My friendly, card-carrying cupids!\" beamed Lockhart. \"They will be roving around the school today delivering your valentines! And the fun doesn\\'t stop here! I\\'m sure my colleagues will want to enter into the spirit of the occasion! Why not ask Professor Snape to show you how to whip up a Love Potion! And while you\\'re at it, Professor Flitwick knows more about Entrancing Enchantments than any wizard I\\'ve ever met, the sly old dog!\" Professor Flitwick buried his face in his hands. Snape was looking as though the first person to ask him for a Love Potion would be force-fed poison. \"Please, Hermione, tell me you weren\\'t one of the forty-six,\" said Ron as they left the Great Hall for their first lesson. Hermione suddenly became very interested in searching her bag for her schedule and didn\\'t answer. All day long, the dwarfs kept barging into their classes to deliver valentines, to the annoyance of the teachers, and late that afternoon as the Gryffindors were walking upstairs for Charms, one of the dwarfs caught up with Harry. \"Oy, you! ‚Arry Potter!\" shouted a particularly grim-looking dwarf, elbowing people out of the way to get to Harry. Hot all over at the thought of being given a valentine in front of a line of first years, which happened to include Ginny Weasley, Harry tried to escape. The dwarf, however, cut his way through the crowd by kicking people\\'s shins, and reached him before he\\'d gone two paces. \"I\\'ve got a musical message to deliver to ‚Arry Potter in person,\" he said, twanging his harp in a threatening sort of way. \"Not here,\" Harry hissed, trying to escape. \"Stay still!\" grunted the dwarf, grabbing hold of Harry\\'s bag and pulling him back. \"Let me go!\" Harry snarled, tugging. With a loud ripping noise, his bag split in two. His books, wand, parchment, and quill spilled onto the floor and his ink bottle smashed over everything. Harry scrambled around, trying to pick it all up before the dwarf started singing, causing something of a holdup in the corridor. \"What\\'s going on here?\" came the cold, drawling voice of Draco Malfoy. Harry started stuffing everything feverishly into his ripped bag, desperate to get away before Malfoy could hear his musical valentine. \"What\\'s all this commotion?\" said another familiar voice as Percy Weasley arrived. Losing his head, Harry tried to make a run for it, but the dwarf seized him around the knees and brought him crashing to the floor. \"Right,\" he said, sitting on Harry\\'s ankles. \"Here is your singing valentine: His eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad, His hair is as dark as a blackboard, I wish he was mine, he\\'s really divine, The hero who conquered the Dark Lord Harry would have given all the gold in Gringotts to evaporate on the spot. Trying valiantly to laugh along with everyone else, he got up, his feet numb from the weight of the dwarf, as Percy Weasley did his best to disperse the crowd, some of whom were crying with mirth. \"Off you go, off you go, the bell rang five minutes ago, off to class, now,\" he said, shooing some of the younger students away. \"And you, Malfoy - \" Harry, glancing over, saw Malfoy stoop and snatch up something. Leering, he showed it to Crabbe and Goyle, and Harry realized that he\\'d got Riddle\\'s diary. \"Give that back,\" said Harry quietly. \"Wonder what Potter\\'s written in this?\" said Malfoy, who obviously hadn\\'t noticed the year on the cover and thought he had Harry\\'s own diary. A hush fell over the onlookers. Ginny was staring from the diary to Harry, looking terrified. \"Hand it over, Malfoy,\" said Percy sternly. \"When I\\'ve had a look,\" said Malfoy, waving the diary tauntingly at Harry. Percy said, \"As a school prefect - \" but Harry had lost his temper. He pulled out his wand and shouted, \"Expelliarmus!\" and just as Snape had disarmed Lockhart, so Malfoy found the diary shooting out of his hand into the air. Ron, grinning broadly, caught it. \"Harry!\" said Percy loudly. \"No magic in the corridors. I\\'ll have to report this, you know!\" But Harry didn\\'t care, he was one-up on Malfoy, and that was worth five points from Gryffindor any day. Malfoy was looking furious, and as Ginny passed him to enter her classroom, he yelled spitefully after her, \"I don\\'t think Potter liked your valentine much!\" Ginny covered her face with her hands and ran into class. Snarling, Ron pulled out his wand, too, but Harry pulled him away. Ron didn\\'t need to spend the whole of Charms belching slugs. It wasn\\'t until they had reached Professor Flitwick\\'s class that Harry noticed something rather odd about Riddle\\'s diary. All his other books were drenched in scarlet ink. The diary, however, was as clean as it had been before the ink bottle had smashed all over it. He tried to point this out to Ron, but Ron was having trouble with his wand again; large purple bubbles were blossoming out of the end, and he wasn\\'t much interested in anything else. Harry went to bed before anyone else in his dormitory that night. This was partly because he didn\\'t think he could stand Fred and George singing, \"His eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad\" one more time, and partly because he wanted to examine Riddle\\'s diary again, and knew that Ron thought he was wasting his time. Harry sat on his four-poster and flicked through the blank pages, not one of which had a trace of scarlet ink on it. Then he pulled a new bottle out of his bedside cabinet, dipped his quill into it, and dropped a blot onto the first page of the diary. The ink shone brightly on the paper for a second and then, as though it was being sucked into the page, vanished. Excited, Harry loaded up his quill a second time and wrote, \"My name is Harry Potter.\" The words shone momentarily on the page and they, too, sank without trace. Then, at last, something happened. Oozing back out of the page, in his very own ink, came words Harry had never written. \"Hello, Harry Potter. My name is Tom Riddle. How did you come by my diary?\" These words, too, faded away, but not before Harry had started to scribble back. \"Someone tried to flush it down a toilet.\" He waited eagerly for Riddle\\'s reply. \"Lucky that I recorded my memories in some more lasting way than ink. But I always knew that there would be those who would not want this diary read.\" \"What do you mean?\" Harry scrawled, blotting the page in his excitement. \"I mean that this diary holds memories of terrible things. Things that were covered up. Things that happened at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.\" \"That\\'s where I am now,\" Harry wrote quickly. \"I\\'m at Hogwarts, and horrible stuff\\'s been happening. Do you know anything about the Chamber of Secrets?\" His heart was hammering. Riddle\\'s reply came quickly, his writing becoming untidier, as though he was hurrying to tell all he knew. \"Of course I know about the Chamber of Secrets. In my day, they told us it was a legend, that it did not exist. But this was a lie. In my fifth year, the Chamber was opened and the monster attacked several students, finally killing one. I caught the person who\\'d opened the Chamber and he was expelled. But the Headmaster, Professor Dippet, ashamed that such a thing had happened at Hogwarts, forbade me to tell the truth. A story was given out that the girl had died in a freak accident. They gave me a nice, shiny, engraved trophy for my trouble and warned me to keep my mouth shut. But I knew it could happen again. The monster lived on, and the one who had the power to release it was not imprisoned.\" Harry nearly upset his ink bottle in his hurry to write back. \"It\\'s happening again now. There have been three attacks and no one seems to know who\\'s behind them. Who was it last time?\" \"I can show you, if you like, \"came Riddle\\'s reply. \"You don\\'t have to take my word for it. I can take you inside my memory of the night when I caught him.\" Harry hesitated, his quill suspended over the diary. What did Riddle mean? How could he be taken inside somebody else\\'s memory? He glanced nervously at the door to the dormitory, which was growing dark. When he looked back at the diary, he saw fresh words forming. \"Let me show you.\" Harry paused for a fraction of a second and then wrote two letters. OK The pages of the diary began to blow as though caught in a high wind, stopping halfway through the month of June. Mouth hanging open, Harry saw that the little square for June thirteenth seemed to have turned into a miniscule television screen. His hands trembling slightly, he raised the book to press his eye against the little window, and before he knew what was happening, he was tilting forward; the window was widening, he felt his body leave his bed, and he was pitched headfirst through the opening in the page, into a whirl of color and shadow. He felt his feet hit solid ground, and stood, shaking, as the blurred shapes around him came suddenly into focus. He knew immediately where he was. This circular room with the sleeping portraits was Dumbledore\\'s office - but it wasn\\'t Dumbledore who was sitting behind the desk. A wizened, frail-looking wizard, bald except for a few wisps of white hair, was reading a letter by candlelight. Harry had never seen this man before. \"I\\'m sorry,\" he said shakily. \"I didn\\'t mean to butt in - \" But the wizard didn\\'t look up. He continued to read, frowning slightly. Harry drew nearer to his desk and stammered, \"Er - I\\'ll just go, shall I?\" Still the wizard ignored him. He didn\\'t seem even to have heard him. Thinking that the wizard might be deaf, Harry raised his voice. \"Sorry I disturbed you. I\\'ll go now,\" he half-shouted. The wizard folded up the letter with a sigh, stood up, walked past Harry without glancing at him, and went to draw the curtains at his window. The sky outside the window was ruby-red; it seemed to be sunset. The wizard went back to the desk, sat down, and twiddled his thumbs, watching the door. Harry looked around the office. No Fawkes the phoenix - no whirring silver contraptions. This was Hogwarts as Riddle had known it, meaning that this unknown wizard was Headmaster, not Dumbledore, and he, Harry, was little more than a phantom, completely invisible to the people of fifty years ago. There was a knock on the office door. \"Enter,\" said the old wizard in a feeble voice. A boy of about sixteen entered, taking off his pointed hat. A silver prefect\\'s badge was glinting on his chest. He was much taller than Harry, but he, too, had jet-black hair. \"Ah, Riddle,\" said the Headmaster. \"You wanted to see me, Professor Dippet?\" said Riddle. He looked nervous. \"Sit down,\" said Dippet. \"I\\'ve just been reading the letter you sent me.\" \"Oh,\" said Riddle. He sat down, gripping his hands together very tightly. \"My dear boy,\" said Dipper kindly, \"I cannot possibly let you stay at school over the summer. Surely you want to go home for the holidays?\" \"No,\" said Riddle at once. \"I\\'d much rather stay at Hogwarts than go back to that - to that - \" \"You live in a Muggle orphanage during the holidays, I believe?\" said Dippet curiously. \"Yes, sir,\" said Riddle, reddening slightly. \"You are Muggle-born?\" \"Half-blood, sir,\" said Riddle. \"Muggle father, witch mother.\" \"And are both your parents - ?\" \"My mother died just after I was born, sir. They told me at the orphanage she lived just long enough to name me - Tom after my father, Marvolo after my grandfather.\" Dipper clucked his tongue sympathetically. \"The thing is, Tom,\" he sighed, \"Special arrangements might have been made for you, but in the current circumstances–\" \"You mean all these attacks, sir?\" said Riddle, and Harry\\'s heart leapt, and he moved closer, scared of missing anything. \"Precisely,\" said the headmaster. \"My dear boy, you must see how foolish it would be of me to allow you to remain at the castle when term ends. Particularly in light of the recent tragedy– the death of that poor little girl– You will be safer by far at your orphanage. As a matter of fact, the Ministry of Magic is even now talking about closing the school. We are no nearer locating the - er - source of all this unpleasantness–\" Riddle\\'s eyes had widened. \"Sir - if the person was caught - if it all stopped - \" \"What do you mean?\" said Dippet with a squeak in his voice, sitting up in his chair. \"Riddle, do you mean you know something about these attacks?\" \"No, sir,\" said Riddle quickly. But Harry was sure it was the same sort of \"no\" that he himself had given Dumbledore. Dippet sank back, looking faintly disappointed. \"You may go, Tom–\" Riddle slid off his chair and slouched out of the room. Harry followed him. Down the moving spiral staircase they went, emerging next to the gargoyle in the darkening corridor. Riddle stopped, and so did Harry, watching him. Harry could tell that Riddle was doing some serious thinking. He was biting his lip, his forehead furrowed. Then, as though he had suddenly reached a decision, he hurried off, Harry gliding noiselessly behind him. They didn\\'t see another person until they reached the entrance hall, when a tall wizard with long, sweeping auburn hair and a beard called to Riddle from the marble staircase. \"What are you doing, wandering around this late, Tom?\" Harry gaped at the wizard. He was none other than a fifty-year-younger Dumbledore. \"I had to see the headmaster, sir,\" said Riddle. \"Well, hurry off to bed,\" said Dumbledore, giving Riddle exactly the kind of penetrating stare Harry knew so well. \"Best not to roam the corridors these days. Not since–\" He sighed heavily, bade Riddle good night, and strode off. Riddle watched him walk out of sight and then, moving quickly, headed straight down the stone steps to the dungeons, with Harry in hot pursuit. But to Harry\\'s disappointment, Riddle led him not into a hidden passageway or a secret tunnel but to the very dungeon in which Harry had Potions with Snape. The torches hadn\\'t been lit, and when Riddle pushed the door almost closed, Harry could only just see him, standing stock-still by the door, watching the passage outside. It felt to Harry that they were there for at least an hour. All he could see was the figure of Riddle at the door, staring through the crack, waiting like a statue. And just when Harry had stopped feeling expectant and tense and started wishing he could return to the present, he heard something move beyond the door. Someone was creeping along the passage. He heard whoever it was pass the dungeon where he and Riddle were hidden. Riddle, quiet as a shadow, edged through the door and followed, Harry tiptoeing behind him, forgetting that he couldn\\'t be heard. For perhaps five minutes they followed the footsteps, until Riddle stopped suddenly, his head inclined in the direction of new noises. Harry heard a door creak open, and then someone speaking in a hoarse whisper. \"C\\'mon– gotta get yeh outta here– C\\'mon now– in the box–\" There was something familiar about that voice– Riddle suddenly jumped around the corner. Harry stepped out behind him. He could see the dark outline of a huge boy who was crouching in front of an open door, a very large box next to it. \"Evening, Rubeus,\" said Riddle sharply. The boy slammed the door shut and stood up. \"What yer doin\\' down here, Tom?\" Riddle stepped closer. \"It\\'s all over,\" he said. \"I\\'m going to have to turn you in, Rubeus. They\\'re talking about closing Hogwarts if the attacks don\\'t stop.\" \"‚N at d\\'yeh - \" \"I don\\'t think you meant to kill anyone. But monsters don\\'t make good pets. I suppose you just let it out for exercise and - \" \"It never killed no one!\" said the large boy, backing against the closed door. From behind him, Harry could hear a funny rustling and clicking. \"Come on, Rubeus,\" said Riddle, moving yet closer. \"The dead girl\\'s parents will be here tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do is make sure that the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered–\" \"It wasn\\'t him!\" roared the boy, his voice echoing in the dark passage. \"He wouldn\\'! He never!\" \"Stand aside,\" said Riddle, drawing out his wand. His spell lit the corridor with a sudden flaming light. The door behind the large boy flew open with such force it knocked him into the wall opposite. And out of it came something that made Harry let out a long, piercing scream unheard by anyone. A vast, low-slung, hairy body and a tangle of black legs; a gleam of many eyes and a pair of razor-sharp pincers - Riddle raised his wand again, but he was too late. The thing bowled him over as it scuttled away, tearing up the corridor and out of sight. Riddle scrambled to his feet, looking after it; he raised his wand, but the huge boy leapt on him, seized his wand, and threw him back down, yelling, \"NOOOOOO!\" The scene whirled, the darkness became complete; Harry felt himself falling and, with a crash, he landed spread-eagled on his four-poster in the Gryffindor dormitory, Riddle\\'s diary lying open on his stomach. Before he had had time to regain his breath, the dormitory door opened and Ron came in. \"There you are,\" he said. Harry sat up. He was sweating and shaking. \"What\\'s up?\" said Ron, looking at him with concern. \"It was Hagrid, Ron. Hagrid opened the Chamber of Secrets fifty years ago.\" CHAPTER FOURTEEN Cornelius Fudge Harry, Ron, and Hermione had always known that Hagrid had an unfortunate liking for large and monstrous creatures. During their first year at Hogwarts he had tried to raise a dragon in his little wooden house, and it would be a long time before they forgot the giant, three-headed dog he\\'d christened \"Fluffy.\" And if, as a boy, Hagrid had heard that a monster was hidden somewhere in the castle, Harry was sure he\\'d have gone to any lengths for a glimpse of it. He\\'d probably thought it was a shame that the monster had been cooped up so long, and thought it deserved the chance to stretch its many legs; Harry could just imagine the thirteen-year-old Hagrid trying to fit a leash and collar on it. But he was equally certain that Hagrid would never have meant to kill anybody. Harry half wished he hadn\\'t found out how to work Riddle\\'s diary. Again and again Ron and Hermione made him recount what he\\'d seen, until he was heartily sick of telling them and sick of the long, circular conversations that followed. \"Riddle might have got the wrong person,\" said Hermione. \"Maybe it was some other monster that was attacking people–\" \"How many monsters d\\'you think this place can hold?\" Ron asked dully. \"We always knew Hagrid had been expelled,\" said Harry miserably. \"And the attacks must\\'ve stopped after Hagrid was kicked out. Otherwise, Riddle wouldn\\'t have got his award.\" Ron tried a different tack. \"Riddle does sound like Percy - who asked him to squeal on Hagrid, anyway?\" \"But the monster had killed someone, Ron,\" said Hermione. \"And Riddle was going to go back to some Muggle orphanage if they closed Hogwarts,\" said Harry. \"I don\\'t blame him for wanting to stay here–\" \"You met Hagrid down Knockturn Alley, didn\\'t you, Harry?\" \"He was buying a Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent,\" said Harry quickly. The three of them fell silent. After a long pause, Hermione voiced the knottiest question of all in a hesitant voice. \"Do you think we should go and ask Hagrid about it all?\" \"That\\'d be a cheerful visit,\" said Ron. \"‚Hello, Hagrid. Tell us, have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?\\'\" In the end, they decided that they would not say anything to Hagrid unless there was another attack, and as more and more days went by with no whisper from the disembodied voice, they became hopeful that they would never need to talk to him about why he had been expelled. It was now nearly four months since Justin and Nearly Headless Nick had been Petrified, and nearly everybody seemed to think that the attacker, whoever it was, had retired for good. Peeves had finally got bored of his \"Oh, Potter, you rotter\" song, Ernie Macmillan asked Harry quite politely to pass a bucket of leaping toadstools in Herbology one day, and in March several of the Mandrakes threw a loud and raucous party in greenhouse three. This made Professor Sprout very happy. \"The moment they start trying to move into each other\\'s pots, we\\'ll know they\\'re fully mature,\" she told Harry. \"Then we\\'ll be able to revive those poor people in the hospital wing.\" The second years were given something new to think about during their Easter holidays. The time had come to choose their subjects for the third year, a matter that Hermione, at least, took very seriously. \"– it could affect our whole future,\" she told Harry and Ron as they pored over lists of new subjects, marking them with checks. \"I just want to give up Potions,\" said Harry. \"We can\\'t,\" said Ron gloomily. \"We keep all our old subjects, or I\\'d\\'ve ditched Defense Against the Dark Arts.\" \"But that\\'s very important!\" said Hermione, shocked. \"Not the way Lockhart teaches it,\" said Ron. \"I haven\\'t learned anything from him except not to set pixies loose.\" Neville Longbottom had been sent letters from all the witches and wizards in his family, all giving him different advice on what to choose. Confused and worried, he sat reading the subject lists with his tongue poking out, asking people whether they thought Arithmancy sounded more difficult than the study of Ancient Runes. Dean Thomas, who, like Harry, had grown up with Muggles, ended up closing his eyes and jabbing his wand at the list, then picking the subjects it landed on. Hermione took nobody\\'s advice but signed up for everything. Harry smiled grimly to himself at the thought of what Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia would say if he tried to discuss his career in wizardry with them. Not that he didn\\'t get any guidance: Percy Weasley was eager to share his experience. \"Depends where you want to go, Harry,\" he said. \"It\\'s never too early to think about the future, so I\\'d recommend Divination. People say Muggle Studies is a soft option, but I personally think wizards should have a thorough understanding of the non-magical community, particularly if they\\'re thinking of working in close contact with them - look at my father, he has to deal with Muggle business all the time. My brother Charlie was always more of an outdoor type, so he went for Care of Magical Creatures. Play to your strengths, Harry.\" But the only thing Harry felt he was really good at was Quidditch. In the end, he chose the same new subjects as Ron, feeling that if he was lousy at them, at least he\\'d have someone friendly to help him. Gryffindor\\'s next Quidditch match would be against Hufflepuff. Wood was insisting on team practices every night after dinner, so that Harry barely had time for anything but Quidditch and homework. However, the training sessions were getting better, or at least drier, and the evening before Saturday\\'s match he went up to his dormitory to drop off his broomstick feeling Gryffindor\\'s chances for the Quidditch cup had never been better. But his cheerful mood didn\\'t last long. At the top of the stairs to the dormitory, he met Neville Longbottom, who was looking frantic. \"Harry - I don\\'t know who did it - I just found - \" Watching Harry fearfully, Neville pushed open the door. The contents of Harry\\'s trunk had been thrown everywhere. His cloak lay ripped on the floor. The bedclothes had been pulled off his four-poster and the drawer had been pulled out of his bedside cabinet, the contents strewn over the mattress. Harry walked over to the bed, open-mouthed, treading on a few loose pages of Travels with Trolls. As he and Neville pulled the blankets back onto his bed, Ron, Dean, and Seamus came in. Dean swore loudly. \"What happened, Harry?\" \"No idea,\" said Harry. But Ron was examining Harry\\'s robes. All the pockets were hanging out. \"Someone\\'s been looking for something,\" said Ron. \"Is there anything missing?\" Harry started to pick up all his things and throw them into his trunk. It was only as he threw the last of the Lockhart books back into it that he realized what wasn\\'t there. \"Riddle\\'s diary\\'s gone,\" he said in an undertone to Ron. \"What?\" Harry jerked his head toward the dormitory door and Ron followed him out. They hurried down to the Gryffindor common room, which was half-empty, and joined Hermione, who was sitting alone, reading a book called Ancient Runes Made Easy. Hermione looked aghast at the news. \"But - only a Gryffindor could have stolen - nobody else knows our password - \" \"Exactly,\" said Harry. They woke the next day to brilliant sunshine and a light, refreshing breeze. \"Perfect Quidditch conditions!\" said Wood enthusiastically at the Gryffindor table, loading the team\\'s plates with scrambled eggs. \"Harry, buck up there, you need a decent breakfast.\" Harry had been staring down the packed Gryffindor table, wondering if the new owner of Riddle\\'s diary was right in front of his eyes. Hermione had been urging him to report the robbery, but Harry didn\\'t like the idea. He\\'d have to tell a teacher all about the diary, and how many people knew why Hagrid had been expelled fifty years ago? He didn\\'t want to be the one who brought it all up again. As he left the Great Hall with Ron and Hermione to go and collect his Quidditch things, another very serious worry was added to Harry\\'s growing list. He had just set foot on the marble staircase when he heard it yet again. \"Kill this time– let me rip– tear–\" He shouted aloud and Ron and Hermione both jumped away from him in alarm. \"The voice!\" said Harry, -looking over his shoulder. \"I just heard it again - didn\\'t you?\" Ron shook his head, wide-eyed. Hermione, however, clapped a hand to her forehead. \"Harry - I think I\\'ve just understood something! I\\'ve got to go to the library!\" And she sprinted away, up the stairs. \"What does she understand?\" said Harry distractedly, still looking around, trying to tell where the voice had come from. \"Loads more than I do,\" said Ron, shaking his head. \"But why\\'s she got to go to the library?\" \"Because that\\'s what Hermione does,\" said Ron, shrugging. \"When in doubt, go to the library.\" Harry stood, irresolute, trying to catch the voice again, but people were now emerging from the Great Hall behind him, talking loudly, exiting through the front doors on their way to the Quidditch pitch. \"You\\'d better get moving,\" said Ron. \"It\\'s nearly eleven - the match - \" Harry raced up to Gryffindor Tower, collected his Nimbus Two Thousand, and joined the large crowd swarming across the grounds, but his mind was still in the castle along with the bodiless voice, and as he pulled on his scarlet robes in the locker room, his only comfort was that everyone was now outside to watch the game. The teams walked onto the field to tumultuous applause. Oliver Wood took off for a warm-up flight around the goal posts; Madam Hooch released the balls. The Hufflepuffs, who played in canary yellow, were standing in a huddle, having a last-minute discussion of tactics. Harry was just mounting his broom when Professor McGonagall came half marching, half running across the pitch, carrying an enormous purple megaphone. Harry\\'s heart dropped like a stone. \"This match has been cancelled,\" Professor McGonagall called through the megaphone, addressing the packed stadium. There were boos and shouts. Oliver Wood, looking devastated, landed and ran toward Professor McGonagall without getting off his broomstick. \"But, Professor!\" he shouted. \"We\\'ve got to play - the cup - Gryffindor - \" Professor McGonagall ignored him and continued to shout through her megaphone: \"All students are to make their way back to the House common rooms, where their Heads of Houses will give them further information. As quickly as you can, please!\" Then she lowered the megaphone and beckoned Harry over to her. \"Potter, I think you\\'d better come with me–\" Wondering how she could possibly suspect him this time, Harry saw Ron detach himself from the complaining crowd; he came running up to them as they set off toward the castle. To Harry\\'s surprise, Professor McGonagall didn\\'t object. \"Yes, perhaps you\\'d better come, too, Weasley–\" Some of the students swarming around them were grumbling about the match being canceled; others looked worried. Harry and Ron followed Professor McGonagall back into the school and up the marble staircase. But they weren\\'t taken to anybody\\'s office this time. \"This will be a bit of a shock,\" said Professor McGonagall in a surprisingly gentle voice as they approached the infirmary. \"There has been another attack– another double attack.\" Harry\\'s insides did a horrible somersault. Professor McGonagall pushed the door open and he and Ron entered– Madam Pomfrey was bending over a fifth-year girl with long, curly hair. Harry recognized her as the Ravenclaw they\\'d accidentally asked for directions to the Slytherin common room. And on the bed next to her was - \"Hermione!\" Ron groaned. Hermione lay utterly still, her eyes open and glassy. \"They were found near the library,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"I don\\'t suppose either of you can explain this? It was on the floor next to them–\" She was holding up a small, circular mirror. Harry and Ron shook their heads, both staring at Hermione. \"I will escort you back to Gryffindor Tower,\" said Professor McGonagall heavily. \"I need to address the students in any case.\" \"All students will return to their House common rooms by six o\\'clock in the evening. No student is to leave the dormitories after that time. You will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher. No student is to use the bathroom unaccompanied by a teacher. All further Quidditch training and matches are to be postponed. There will be no more evening activities.\" The Gryffindors packed inside the common room listened to Professor McGonagall in silence. She rolled up the parchment from which she had been reading and said in a somewhat choked voice, \"I need hardly add that I have rarely been so distressed. It is likely that the school will be closed unless the culprit behind these attacks is caught. I would urge anyone who thinks they might know anything about them to come forward.\" She climbed somewhat awkwardly out of the portrait hole, and the Gryffindors began talking immediately. \"That\\'s two Gryffindors down, not counting a Gryffindor ghost, one Ravenclaw, and one Hufflepuff, \" said the Weasley twins\\' friend Lee Jordan, counting on his fingers. \"Haven\\'t any of the teachers noticed that the Slytherins are all safe? Isn\\'t it obvious all this stuff\\'s coming from Slytherin? The Heir of Slytherin, the monster of Slytherin - why don\\'t they just chuck all the Slytherins out?\" he roared, to nods and scattered applause. Percy Weasley was sitting in a chair behind Lee, but for once he didn\\'t seem keen to make his views heard. He was looking pale and stunned. \"Percy\\'s in shock,\" George told Harry quietly. \"That Ravenclaw girl - Penelope Clearwater - she\\'s a prefect. I don\\'t think he thought the monster would dare attack a prefect.\" But Harry was only half-listening. He didn\\'t seem to be able to get rid of the picture of Hermione, lying on the hospital bed as though carved out of stone. And if the culprit wasn\\'t caught soon, he was looking at a lifetime back with the Dursleys. Tom Riddle had turned Hagrid in because he was faced with the prospect of a Muggle orphanage if the school closed. Harry now knew exactly how he had felt. \"What\\'re we going to do?\" said Ron quietly in Harry\\'s ear. \"D\\'you think they suspect Hagrid?\" \"We\\'ve got to go and talk to him,\" said Harry, making up his mind. \"I can\\'t believe it\\'s him this time, but if he set the monster loose last time he\\'ll know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets, and that\\'s a start.\" \"But McGonagall said we\\'ve got to stay in our tower unless we\\'re in class - \" \"I think,\" said Harry, more quietly still, \"it\\'s time to get my dad\\'s old cloak out again.\" Harry had inherited just one thing from his father: a long and silvery Invisibility Cloak. It was their only chance of sneaking out of the school to visit Hagrid without anyone knowing about it. They went to bed at the usual time, waited until Neville, Dean, and Seamus had stopped discussing the Chamber of Secrets and finally fallen asleep, then got up, dressed again, and threw the cloak over themselves. The journey through the dark and deserted castle corridors wasn\\'t enjoyable. Harry, who had wandered the castle at night several times before, had never seen it so crowded after sunset. Teachers, prefects, and ghosts were marching the corridors in pairs, staring around for any unusual activity. Their Invisibility Cloak didn\\'t stop them making any noise, and there was a particularly tense moment when Ron stubbed his toe only yards from the spot where Snape stood standing guard. Thankfully, Snape sneezed at almost exactly the moment Ron swore. It was with relief that they reached the oak front doors and eased them open. It was a clear, starry night. They hurried toward the lit windows of Hagrid\\'s house and pulled off the cloak only when they were right outside his front door. Seconds after they had knocked, Hagrid flung it open. They found themselves face-to-face with him aiming a crossbow at them. Fang the boarhound barked loudly behind him. \"Oh,\" he said, lowering the weapon and staring at them. \"What\\'re you two doin\\' here?\" \"What\\'s that for?\" said Harry, pointing at the crossbow as they stepped inside. \"Nothin\\' - nothin\\' - \" Hagrid muttered. \"I\\'ve bin expectin\\' - doesn\\' matter - Sit down - I\\'ll make tea - \" He hardly seemed to know what he was doing. He nearly extinguished the fire, spilling water from the kettle on it, and then smashed the teapot with a nervous jerk of his massive hand. \"Are you okay, Hagrid?\" said Harry. \"Did you hear about Hermione?\" \"Oh, I heard, all righ\\',\" said Hagrid, a slight break in his voice. He kept glancing nervously at the windows. He poured them both large mugs of boiling water (he had forgotten to add tea bags) and was just putting a slab of fruitcake on a plate when there was a loud knock on the door. Hagrid dropped the fruitcake. Harry and Ron exchanged panicstricken looks, then threw the Invisibility Cloak back over themselves and retreated into a corner. Hagrid checked that they were hidden, seized his crossbow, and flung open his door once more. \"Good evening, Hagrid.\" It was Dumbledore. He entered, looking deadly serious, and was followed by a second, very odd-looking man. The stranger had rumpled gray hair and an anxious expression, and was wearing a strange mixture of clothes: a pinstriped suit, a scarlet tie, a long black cloak, and pointed purple boots. Under his arm he carried a lime-green bowler. \"That\\'s Dad\\'s boss!\" Ron breathed. \"Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic!\" Harry elbowed Ron hard to make him shut up. Hagrid had gone pale and sweaty. He dropped into one of his chairs and looked from Dumbledore to Cornelius Fudge. \"Bad business, Hagrid,\" said Fudge in rather clipped tones. \"Very bad business. Had to come. Four attacks on Muggle-borns. Things\\'ve gone far enough. Ministry\\'s got to act.\" \"I never,\" said Hagrid, looking imploringly at Dumbledore. \"You know I never, Professor Dumbledore, sir - \" \"I want it understood, Cornelius, that Hagrid has my full confidence,\" said Dumbledore, frowning at Fudge. \"Look, Albus,\" said Fudge, uncomfortably. \"Hagrid\\'s record\\'s against him. Ministry\\'s got to do something - the school governors have been in touch - \" \"Yet again, Cornelius, I tell you that taking Hagrid away will not help in the slightest,\" said Dumbledore. His blue eyes were full of a fire Harry had never seen before. \"Look at it from my point of view,\" said Fudge, fidgeting with his bowler. \"I\\'m under a lot of pressure. Got to be seen to be doing something. If it turns out it wasn\\'t Hagrid, he\\'ll be back and no more said. But I\\'ve got to take him. Got to. Wouldn\\'t be doing my duty - \" \"Take me?\" said Hagrid, who was trembling. \"Take me where?\" \"For a short stretch only,\" said Fudge, not meeting Hagrid\\'s eyes. \"Not a punishment, Hagrid, more a precaution. If someone else is caught, you\\'ll be let out with a full apology - \" \"Not Azkaban?\" croaked Hagrid. Before Fudge could answer, there was another loud rap on the door. Dumbledore answered it. It was Harry\\'s turn for an elbow in the ribs; he\\'d let out an audible gasp. Mr. Lucius Malfoy strode into Hagrid\\'s hut, swathed in a long black traveling cloak, smiling a cold and satisfied smile. Fang started to growl. \"Already here, Fudge,\" he said approvingly. \"Good, good–\" \"What\\'re you doin\\' here?\" said Hagrid furiously. \"Get outta my house!\" \"My dear man, please believe me, I have no pleasure at all in being inside your - er - d\\'you call this a house?\" said Lucius Malfoy, sneering as he looked around the small cabin. \"I simply called at the school and was told that the headmaster was here.\" \"And what exactly did you want with me, Lucius?\" said Dumbledore. He spoke politely, but the fire was still blazing in his blue eyes. \"Dreadful thing, Dumbledore,\" said Malfoy lazily, taking out a long roll of parchment, \"but the governors feel it\\'s time for you to step aside. This is an Order of Suspension - you\\'ll find all twelve signatures on it. I\\'m afraid we feel you\\'re losing your touch. How many attacks have there been now? Two more this afternoon, wasn\\'t it? At this rate, there\\'ll be no Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts, and we all know what an awful loss that would be to the school.\" \"Oh, now, see here, Lucius,\" said Fudge, looking alarmed, \"Dumbledore suspended - no, no - last thing we want just now.\" \"The appointment - or suspension - of the headmaster is a matter for the governors, Fudge,\" said Mr. Malfoy smoothly. \"And as Dumbledore has failed to stop these attacks - \" \"See here, Malfoy, if Dumbledore can\\'t stop them,\" said Fudge, whose upper lip was sweating now, \"I mean to say, who can?\" \"That remains to be seen,\" said Mr. Malfoy with a nasty smile. \"But as all twelve of us have voted - \" Hagrid leapt to his feet, his shaggy black head grazing the ceiling. ‚An\\' how many did yeh have ter threaten an\\' blackmail before they agreed, Malfoy, eh?\" he roared. \"Dear, dear, you know, that temper of yours will lead you into trouble one of these days, Hagrid,\" said Mr. Malfoy. \"I would advise you not to shout at the Azkaban guards like that. They won\\'t like it at all.\" \"Yeh can\\' take Dumbledore!\" yelled Hagrid, making Fang the boarhound cower and whimper in his basket. \"Take him away, an\\' the Muggle-borns won\\' stand a chance! There\\'ll be killin\\' next!\" \"Calm yourself, Hagrid,\" said Dumbledore sharply. He looked at Lucius Malfoy. \"If the governors want my removal, Lucius, I shall of course step aside - \" \"But - \" stuttered Fudge. \"No!\" growled Hagrid. Dumbledore had not taken his bright blue eyes off Lucius Malfoy\\'s cold gray ones. \"However,\" said Dumbledore, speaking very slowly and clearly so that none of them could miss a word, \"you will find that I will only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me– Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.\" For a second, Harry was almost sure Dumbledore\\'s eyes flickered toward the corner where he and Ron were hidden. \"Admirable sentiments,\" said Malfoy, bowing. \"We shall all miss your - er - highly individual way of running things, Albus, and only hope your successor will manage to prevent any - ah - killins.\" He strode to the cabin door, opened it, and bowed Dumbledore out. Fudge, fiddling with his bowler, waited for Hagrid to go ahead of him, but Hagrid stood his ground, took a deep breath, and said carefully, \"If anyone wanted ter find out some stuff, all they\\'d have ter do would be ter follow the spiders. That\\'d lead ‚em right. That\\'s all I\\'m sayin\\'.\" Fudge stared at him in amazement. \"All right, I\\'m comin\\', said Hagrid, pulling on his moleskin overcoat. But as he was about to follow Fudge through the door, he stopped again and said loudly, \"An\\' someone\\'ll need ter feed Fang while I\\'m away.\" The door banged shut and Ron pulled off the Invisibility Cloak. \"We\\'re in trouble now,\" Ron said hoarsely. \"No Dumbledore. They might as well close the school tonight. There\\'ll be an attack a day with him gone.\" Fang started howling, scratching at the closed door. CHAPTER FIFTEEN Aragog Summer was creeping over the grounds around the castle; sky and lake alike turned periwinkle blue and flowers large as cabbages burst into bloom in the greenhouses. But with no Hagrid visible from the castle windows, striding the grounds with Fang at his heels, the scene didn\\'t look right to Harry; no better, in fact, than the inside of the castle, where things were so horribly wrong. Harry and Ron had tried to visit Hermione, but visitors were now barred from the hospital wing. \"We\\'re taking no more chances,\" Madam Pomfrey told them severely through a crack in the infirmary door. \"No, I\\'m sorry, there\\'s every chance the attacker might come back to finish these people off–\" With Dumbledore gone, fear had spread as never before, so that the sun warming the castle walls outside seemed to stop at the mullioned windows. There was barely a face to be seen in the school that didn\\'t look worried and tense, and any laughter that rang through the corridors sounded shrill and unnatural and was quickly stifled. Harry constantly repeated Dumbledore\\'s final words to himself \"I will only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me– Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.\" But what good were these words? Who exactly were they supposed to ask for help, when everyone was just as confused and scared as they were? Hagrid\\'s hint about the spiders was far easier to understand. The trouble was, there didn\\'t seem to be a single spider left in the castle to follow. Harry looked everywhere he went, helped (rather reluctantly) by Ron. They were hampered, of course, by the fact that they weren\\'t allowed to wander off on their own but had to move around the castle in a pack with the other Gryffindors. Most of their fellow students seemed glad that they were being shepherded from class to class by teachers, but Harry found it very irksome. One person, however, seemed to be thoroughly enjoying the atmosphere of terror and suspicion. Draco Malfoy was strutting around the school as though he had just been appointed Head Boy. Harry didn\\'t realize what he was so pleased about until the Potions lesson about two weeks after Dumbledore and Hagrid had left, when, sitting right behind Malfoy, Harry overheard him gloating to Crabbe and Goyle. \"I always thought Father might be the one who got rid of Dumbledore,\" he said, not troubling to keep his voice down. \"I told you he thinks Dumbledore\\'s the worst headmaster the school\\'s ever had. Maybe we\\'ll get a decent headmaster now. Someone who won\\'t want the Chamber of Secrets closed. McGonagall won\\'t last long, she\\'s only filling in–\" Snape swept past Harry, making no comment about Hermione\\'s empty seat and cauldron. \"Sir,\" said Malfoy loudly. \"Sir, why don\\'t you apply for the headmaster\\'s job?\" \"Now, now, Malfoy,\" said Snape, though he couldn\\'t suppress a thin-lipped smile. \"Professor Dumbledore has only been suspended by the governors. I daresay he\\'ll be back with us soon enough.\" \"Yeah, right,\" said Malfoy, smirking. \"I expect you\\'d have Father\\'s vote, sir, if you wanted to apply for the job - I\\'ll tell Father you\\'re the best teacher here, sir - \" Snape smirked as he swept off around the dungeon, fortunately not spotting Seamus Finnigan, who was pretending to vomit into his cauldron. \"I\\'m quite surprised the Mudbloods haven\\'t all packed their bags by now,\" Malfoy went on. \"Bet you five Galleons the next one dies. Pity it wasn\\'t Granger - \" The bell rang at that moment, which was lucky; at Malfoy\\'s last words, Ron had leapt off his stool, and in the scramble to collect bags and books, his attempts to reach Malfoy went unnoticed. \"Let me at him,\" Ron growled as Harry and Dean hung onto his arms. \"I don\\'t care, I don\\'t need my wand, I\\'m going to kill him with my bare hands - \" \"Hurry up, I\\'ve got to take you all to Herbology,\" barked Snape over the class\\'s heads, and off they marched, with Harry, Ron, and Dean bringing up the rear, Ron still trying to get loose. It was only safe to let go of him when Snape had seen them out of the castle and they were making their way across the vegetable patch toward the greenhouses. The Herbology class was very subdued; there were now two missing from their number, Justin and Hermione. Professor Sprout set them all to work pruning the Abyssinian Shrivelfigs. Harry went to tip an armful of withered stalks onto the compost heap and found himself face-to-face with Ernie Macmillan. Ernie took a deep breath and said, very formally, \"I just want to say, Harry, that I\\'m sorry I ever suspected you. I know you\\'d never attack Hermione Granger, and I apologize for all the stuff I said. We\\'re all in the same boat now, and, well - \" He held out a pudgy hand, and Harry shook it. Ernie and his friend Hannah came to work at the same Shrivelfig as Harry and Ron. \"That Draco Malfoy character,\" said Ernie, breaking off dead twigs, \"he seems very pleased about all this, doesn\\'t he? D\\'you know, I think he might be Slytherin\\'s heir.\" \"That\\'s clever of you,\" said Ron, who didn\\'t seem to have forgiven Ernie as readily as Harry. \"Do you think it\\'s Malfoy, Harry?\" Ernie asked. \"No,\" said Harry, so firmly that Ernie and Hannah stared. A second later, Harry spotted something. Several large spiders were scuttling over the ground on the other side of the glass, moving in an unnaturally straight line as though taking the shortest route to a prearranged meeting. Harry hit Ron over the hand with his pruning shears. \"Ouch! What\\'re you - \" Harry pointed out the spiders, following their progress with his eyes screwed up against the sun. \"Oh, yeah,\" said Ron, trying, and failing, to look pleased. \"But we can\\'t follow them now - \" Ernie and Hannah were listening curiously. Harry\\'s eyes narrowed as he focused on the spiders. If they pursued their fixed course, there could be no doubt about where they would end up. \"Looks like they\\'re heading for the Forbidden Forest–\" And Ron looked even unhappier about that. At the end of the lesson Professor Sprout escorted the class to their Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson. Harry and Ron lagged behind the others so they could talk out of earshot. \"We\\'ll have to use the Invisibility Cloak again,\" Harry told Ron. \"We can take Fang with us. He\\'s used to going into the forest with Hagrid, he might be some help.\" \"Right,\" said Ron, who was twirling his wand nervously in his fingers. \"Er - aren\\'t there - aren\\'t there supposed to be werewolves in the forest?\" he added as they took their usual places at the back of Lockhart\\'s classroom. Preferring not to answer that question, Harry said, \"There are good things in there, too. The centaurs are all right, and the unicorns–\" Ron had never been into the Forbidden Forest before. Harry had entered it only once and had hoped never to do so again. Lockhart bounded into the room and the class stared at him. Every other teacher in the place was looking grimmer than usual, but Lockhart appeared nothing short of buoyant. \"Come now,\" he cried, beaming around him. \"Why all these long faces?\" People swapped exasperated looks, but nobody answered. \"Don\\'t you people realize,\" said Lockhart, speaking slowly, as though they were all a bit dim, \"the danger has passed! The culprit has been taken away - \" \"Says who?\" said Dean Thomas loudly. \"My dear young man, the Minister of Magic wouldn\\'t have taken Hagrid if he hadn\\'t been one hundred percent sure that he was guilty,\" said Lockhart, in the tone of someone explaining that one and one made two. \"Oh, yes he would,\" said Ron, even more loudly than Dean. \"I flatter myself I know a touch more about Hagrid\\'s arrest than you do, Mr. Weasley,\" said Lockhart in a self-satisfied tone. Ron started to say that he didn\\'t think so, somehow, but stopped in midsentence when Harry kicked him hard under the desk. \"We weren\\'t there, remember?\" Harry muttered. But Lockhart\\'s disgusting cheeriness, his hints that he had always thought Hagrid was no good, his confidence that the whole business was now at an end, irritated Harry so much that he yearned to throw Gadding with Ghouls right in Lockhart\\'s stupid face. Instead he contented himself with scrawling a note to Ron: Let\\'s do it tonight. Ron read the message, swallowed hard, and looked sideways at the empty seat usually filled by Hermione. The sight seemed to stiffen his resolve, and he nodded. The Gryffindor common room was always very crowded these days, because from six o\\'clock onward the Gryffindors had nowhere else to go. They also had plenty to talk about, with the result that the common room often didn\\'t empty until past midnight. Harry went to get the Invisibility Cloak out of his trunk right after dinner, and spent the evening sitting on it, waiting for the room to clear. Fred and George challenged Harry and Ron to a few games of Exploding Snap, and Ginny sat watching them, very subdued in Hermione\\'s usual chair. Harry and Ron kept losing on purpose, trying to finish the games quickly, but even so, it was well past midnight when Fred, George, and Ginny finally went to bed. Harry and Ron waited for the distant sounds of two dormitory doors closing before seizing the cloak, throwing it over themselves, and climbing through the portrait hole. It was another difficult journey through the castle, dodging all the teachers. At last they reached the entrance hall, slid back the lock on the oak front doors, squeezed between them, trying to stop any creaking, and stepped out into the moonlit grounds. \"\\'Course,\" said Ron abruptly as they strode across the black grass, \"we might get to the forest and find there\\'s nothing to follow. Those spiders might not\\'ve been going there at all. I know it looked like they were moving in that sort of general direction, but–\" His voice trailed away hopefully. They reached Hagrid\\'s house, sad and sorry-looking with its blank windows. When Harry pushed the door open, Fang went mad with joy at the sight of them. Worried he might wake everyone at the castle with his deep, booming barks, they hastily fed him treacle fudge from a tin on the mantelpiece, which glued his teeth together. Harry left the Invisibility Cloak on Hagrid\\'s table. There would be no need for it in the pitch-dark forest. \"C\\'mon, Fang, we\\'re going for a walk,\" said Harry, patting his leg, and Fang bounded happily out of the house behind them, dashed to the edge of the forest, and lifted his leg against a large sycamore tree. Harry took out his wand, murmured, \"Lumos!\" and a tiny light appeared at the end of it, just enough to let them watch the path for signs of spiders. \"Good thinking,\" said Ron. \"I\\'d light mine, too, but you know - it\\'d probably blow up or something–\" Harry tapped Ron on the shoulder, pointing at the grass. Two solitary spiders were hurrying away from the wandlight into the shade of the trees. \"Okay,\" Ron sighed as though resigned to the worst, \"I\\'m ready. Let\\'s go.\" So, with Fang scampering around them, sniffing tree roots and leaves, they entered the forest. By the glow of Harry\\'s wand, they followed the steady trickle of spiders moving along the path. They walked behind them for about twenty minutes, not speaking, listening hard for noises other than breaking twigs and rustling leaves. Then, when the trees had become thicker than ever, so that the stars overhead were no longer visible, and Harry\\'s wand shone alone in the sea of dark, they saw their spider guides leaving the path. Harry paused, trying to see where the spiders were going, but everything outside his little sphere of light was pitch-black. He had never been this deep into the forest before. He could vividly remember Hagrid advising him not to leave the forest path last time he\\'d been in here. But Hagrid was miles away now, probably sitting in a cell in Azkaban, and he had also said to follow the spiders. Something wet touched Harry\\'s hand and he jumped backward, crushing Ron\\'s foot, but it was only Fang\\'s nose. \"What d\\'you reckon?\" Harry said to Ron, whose eyes he could just make out, reflecting the light from his wand. \"We\\'ve come this far,\" said Ron. So they followed the darting shadows of the spiders into the trees. They couldn\\'t move very quickly now; there were tree roots and stumps in their way, barely visible in the near blackness. Harry could feel Fang\\'s hot breath on his hand. More than once, they had to stop, so that Harry could crouch down and find the spiders in the wandlight. They walked for what seemed like at least half an hour, their robes snagging on low-slung branches and brambles. After a while, they noticed that the ground seemed to be sloping downward, though the trees were as thick as ever. Then Fang suddenly let loose a great, echoing bark, making both Harry and Ron jump out of their skins. \"What?\" said Ron loudly, looking around into the pitch-dark, and gripping Harry\\'s elbow very hard. \"There\\'s something moving over there,\" Harry breathed. \"Listen– sounds like something big–\" They listened. Some distance to their right, the something big was snapping branches as it carved a path through the trees. \"Oh, no,\" said Ron. \"Oh, no, oh, no, oh - \" \"Shut up,\" said Harry frantically. \"It\\'ll hear you.\" \"Hear me?\" said Ron in an unnaturally high voice. \"It\\'s already heard Fang!\" The darkness seemed to be pressing on their eyeballs as they stood, terrified, waiting. There was a strange rumbling noise and then silence. \"What d\\'you think it\\'s doing?\" said Harry. \"Probably getting ready to pounce,\" said Ron. They waited, shivering, hardly daring to move. \"D\\'you think it\\'s gone?\" Harry whispered. \"Dunno - \" Then, to their right, came a sudden blaze of light, so bright in the darkness that both of them flung up their hands to shield their eyes. Fang yelped and tried to run, but got lodged in a tangle of thorns and yelped even louder. \"Harry!\" Ron shouted, his voice breaking with relief \"Harry, it\\'s our car!\" \"What?\" \"Come on!\" Harry blundered after Ron toward the light, stumbling and tripping, and a moment later they had emerged into a clearing. Mr. Weasley\\'s car was standing, empty, in the middle of a circle of thick trees under a roof of dense branches, its headlights ablaze. As Ron walked, open-mouthed, toward it, it moved slowly toward him, exactly like a large, turquoise dog greeting its owner. \"It\\'s been here all the time!\" said Ron delightedly, walking around the car. \"Look at it. The forest\\'s turned it wild–\" The sides of the car were scratched and smeared with mud. Apparently it had taken to trundling around the forest on its own. Fang didn\\'t seem at all keen on it; he kept close to Harry, who could feel him quivering. His breathing slowing down again, Harry stuffed his wand back into his robes. \"And we thought it was going to attack us!\" said Ron, leaning against the car and patting it. \"I wondered where it had gone!\" Harry squinted around on the floodlit ground for signs of more spiders, but they had all scuttled away from the glare of the headlights. \"We\\'ve lost the trail,\" he said. \"C\\'mon, let\\'s go and find them.\" Ron didn\\'t speak. He didn\\'t move. His eyes were fixed on a point some ten feet above the forest floor, right behind Harry. His face was livid with terror. Harry didn\\'t even have time to turn around. There was a loud clicking noise and suddenly he felt something long and hairy seize him around the middle and lift him off the ground, so that he was hanging facedown. Struggling, terrified, he heard more clicking, and saw Ron\\'s legs leave the ground, too, heard Fang whimpering and howling - next moment, he was being swept away into the dark trees. Head hanging, Harry saw that what had hold of him was marching on six immensely long, hairy legs, the front two clutching him tightly below a pair of shining black pincers. Behind him, he could hear another of the creatures, no doubt carrying Ron. They were moving into the very heart of the forest. Harry could hear Fang fighting to free himself from a third monster, whining loudly, but Harry couldn\\'t have yelled even if he had wanted to; he seemed to have left his voice back with the car in the clearing. He never knew how long he was in the creature\\'s clutches; he only knew that the darkness suddenly lifted enough for him to see that the leaf-strewn ground was now swarming with spiders. Craning his neck sideways, he realized that they had reached the ridge of a vast hollow, a hollow that had been cleared of trees, so that the stars shone brightly onto the worst scene he had ever laid eyes on. Spiders. Not tiny spiders like those surging over the leaves below. Spiders the size of carthorses, eight-eyed, eight-legged, black, hairy, gigantic. The massive specimen that was carrying Harry made its way down the steep slope toward a misty, domed web in the very center of the hollow, while its fellows closed in all around it, clicking their pincers excitedly at the sight of its load. Harry fell to the ground on all fours as the spider released him. Ron and Fang thudded down next to him. Fang wasn\\'t howling anymore, but cowering silently on the spot. Ron looked exactly like Harry felt. His mouth was stretched wide in a kind of silent scream and his eyes were popping. Harry suddenly realized that the spider that had dropped him was saying something. It had been hard to tell, because he clicked his pincers with every word he spoke. \"Aragog!\" it called. \"Aragog!\" And from the middle of the misty, domed web, a spider the size of a small elephant emerged, very slowly. There was gray in the black of his body and legs, and each of the eyes on his ugly, pincered head was milky white. He was blind. \"What is it?\" he said, clicking his pincers rapidly. \"Men,\" clicked the spider who had caught Harry. \"Is it Hagrid?\" said Aragog, moving closer, his eight milky eyes wandering vaguely. \"Strangers,\" clicked the spider who had brought Ron. \"Kill them,\" clicked Aragog fretfully. \"I was sleeping–\" \"We\\'re friends of Hagrid\\'s,\" Harry shouted. His heart seemed to have left his chest to pound in his throat. Click, click, click went the pincers of the spiders all around the hollow. Aragog paused. \"Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before,\" he said slowly. \"Hagrid\\'s in trouble,\" said Harry, breathing very fast. \"That\\'s why we\\'ve come.\" \"In trouble?\" said the aged spider, and Harry thought he heard concern beneath the clicking pincers. \"But why has he sent you?\" Harry thought of getting to his feet but decided against it; he didn\\'t think his legs would support him. So he spoke from the ground, as calmly as he could. \"They think, up at the school, that Hagrid\\'s been setting a - a - something on students. They\\'ve taken him to Azkaban.\" Aragog clicked his pincers furiously, and all around the hollow the sound was echoed by the crowd of spiders; it was like applause, except applause didn\\'t usually make Harry feel sick with fear. \"But that was years ago,\" said Aragog fretfully. \"Years and years ago. I remember it well. That\\'s why they made him leave the school. They believed that I was the monster that dwells in what they call the Chamber of Secrets. They thought that Hagrid had opened the Chamber and set me free.\" \"And you– you didn\\'t come from the Chamber of Secrets?\" said Harry, who could feel cold sweat on his forehead. \"I!\" said Aragog, clicking angrily. \"I was not born in the castle. I come from a distant land. A traveler gave me to Hagrid when I was an egg. Hagrid was only a boy, but he cared for me, hidden in a cupboard in the castle, feeding me on scraps from the table. Hagrid is my good friend, and a good man. When I was discovered, and blamed for the death of a girl, he protected me. I have lived here in the forest ever since, where Hagrid still visits me. He even found me a wife, Mosag, and you see how our family has grown, all through Hagrid\\'s goodness–\" Harry summoned what remained of his courage. \"So you never - never attacked anyone?\" \"Never,\" croaked the old spider. \"It would have been my instinct, but out of respect for Hagrid, I never harmed a human. The body of the girl who was killed was discovered in a bathroom. I never saw any part of the castle but the cupboard in which I grew up. Our kind like the dark and the quiet–\" \"But then– Do you know what did kill that girl?\" said Harry. \"Because whatever it is, it\\'s back and attacking people again - \" His words were drowned by a loud outbreak of clicking and the rustling of many long legs shifting angrily; large black shapes shifted all around him. \"The thing that lives in the castle,\" said Aragog, \"is an ancient creature we spiders fear above all others. Well do I remember how I pleaded with Hagrid to let me go, when I sensed the beast moving about the school.\" \"What is it?\" said Harry urgently. More loud clicking, more rustling; the spiders seemed to be closing in. \"We do not speak of it!\" said Aragog fiercely. \"We do not name it! I never even told Hagrid the name of that dread creature, though he asked me, many times.\" Harry didn\\'t want to press the subject, not with the spiders pressing closer on all sides. Aragog seemed to be tired of talking. He was backing slowly into his domed web, but his fellow spiders continued to inch slowly toward Harry and Ron. \"We\\'ll just go, then,\" Harry called desperately to Aragog, hearing leaves rustling behind him. \"Go?\" said Aragog slowly. \"I think not–\" \"But - but - \" \"My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid, on my command. But I cannot deny them fresh meat, when it wanders so willingly into our midst. Good-bye, friend of Hagrid.\" Harry spun around. Feet away, towering above him, was a solid wall of spiders, clicking, their many eyes gleaming in their ugly black heads. Even as he reached for his wand, Harry knew it was no good, there were too many of them, but as he tried to stand, ready to die fighting, a loud, long note sounded, and a blaze of light flamed through the hollow. Mr. Weasley\\'s car was thundering down the slope, headlights glaring, its horn screeching, knocking spiders aside; several were thrown onto their backs, their endless legs waving in the air. The car screeched to a halt in front of Harry and Ron and the doors flew open. \"Get Fang!\" Harry yelled, diving into the front seat; Ron seized the boarhound around the middle and threw him, yelping, into the back of the car - the doors slammed shut - Ron didn\\'t touch the accelerator but the car didn\\'t need him; the engine roared and they were off, hitting more spiders. They sped up the slope, out of the hollow, and they were soon crashing through the forest, branches whipping the windows as the car wound its way cleverly through the widest gaps, following a path it obviously knew. Harry looked sideways at Ron. His mouth was still open in the silent scream, but his eyes weren\\'t popping anymore. \"Are you okay?\" Ron stared straight ahead, unable to speak. They smashed their way through the undergrowth, Fang howling loudly in the back seat, and Harry saw the side mirror snap off as they squeezed past a large oak. After ten noisy, rocky minutes, the trees thinned, and Harry could again see patches of sky. The car stopped so suddenly that they were nearly thrown into the windshield. They had reached the edge of the forest. Fang flung himself at the window in his anxiety to get out, and when Harry opened the door, he shot off through the trees to Hagrid\\'s house, tail between his legs. Harry got out too, and after a minute or so, Ron seemed to regain the feeling in his limbs and followed, still stiff-necked and staring. Harry gave the car a grateful pat as it reversed back into the forest and disappeared from view. Harry went back into Hagrid\\'s cabin to get the Invisibility Cloak. Fang was trembling under a blanket in his basket. When Harry got outside again, he found Ron being violent sick in the pumpkin patch. \"Follow the spiders,\" said Ron weakly, wiping his mouth on his sleeve. \"I\\'ll never forgive Hagrid. We\\'re lucky to be alive.\" \"I bet he thought Aragog wouldn\\'t hurt friends of his,\" said Harry. \"That\\'s exactly Hagrid\\'s problem!\" said Ron, thumping the wall of the cabin. \"He always thinks monsters aren\\'t as bad as they\\'re made out, and look where it\\'s got him! A cell in Azkaban!\" He was shivering uncontrollably now. \"What was the point of sending us in there? What have we found out, I\\'d like to know?\" \"That Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets,\" said Harry, throwing the cloak over Ron and prodding him in the arm to make him walk. \"He was innocent.\" Ron gave a loud snort. Evidently, hatching Aragog in a cupboard wasn\\'t his idea of being innocent. As the castle loomed nearer Harry twitched the cloak to make sure their feet were hidden, then pushed the creaking front doors ajar. They walked carefully back across the entrance hall and up the marble staircase, holding their breath as they passed corridors where watchful sentries were walking. At last they reached the safety of the Gryffindor common room, where the fire had burned itself into glowing ash. They took off the cloak and climbed the winding stair to their dormitory. Ron fell onto his bed without bothering to get undressed. Harry, however, didn\\'t feel very sleepy. He sat on the edge of his fourposter, thinking hard about everything Aragog had said. The creature that was lurking somewhere in the castle, he thought, sounded like a sort of monster Voldemort - even other monsters didn\\'t want to name it. But he and Ron were no closer to finding out what it was, or how it petrified its victims. Even Hagrid had never known what was in the Chamber of Secrets. Harry swung his legs up onto his bed and leaned back against his pillows, watching the moon glinting at him through the tower window. He couldn\\'t see what else they could do. They had hit dead ends everywhere. Riddle had caught the wrong person, the Heir of Slytherin had got off, and no one could tell whether it was the same person, or a different one, who had opened the Chamber this time. There was nobody else to ask. Harry lay down, still thinking about what Aragog had said. He was becoming drowsy when what seemed like their very last hope occurred to him, and he suddenly sat bolt upright. \"Ron,\" he hissed through the dark, \"Ron - \" Ron woke with a yelp like Fang\\'s, stared wildly around, and saw Harry. \"Ron - that girl who died. Aragog said she was found in a bathroom,\" said Harry, ignoring Neville\\'s snuffling snores from the corner. \"What if she never left the bathroom? What if she\\'s still there?\" Ron rubbed his eyes, frowning through the moonlight. And then he understood, too. \"You don\\'t think - not Moaning Myrtle?\" CHAPTER SIXTEEN The Chamber of Secrets \"All those times we were in that bathroom, and she was just three toilets away,\" said Ron bitterly at breakfast next day, \"and we could\\'ve asked her, and now–\" It had been hard enough trying to look for spiders. Escaping their teachers long enough to sneak into a girls\\' bathroom, the girls\\' bathroom, moreover, right next to the scene of the first attack, was going to be almost impossible. But something happened in their first lesson, Transfiguration, that drove the Chamber of Secrets out of their minds for the first time in weeks. Ten minutes into the class, Professor McGonagall told them that their exams would start on the first of June, one week from today. \"Exams?\" howled Seamus Finnigan. \"We\\'re still getting exams?\" There was a loud bang behind Harry as Neville Longbottom\\'s wand slipped, vanishing one of the legs on his desk. Professor McGonagall restored it with a wave of her own wand, and turned, frowning, to Seamus. \"The whole point of keeping the school open at this time is for you to receive your education,\" she said sternly. \"The exams will therefore take place as usual, and I trust you are all studying hard.\" Studying hard! It had never occurred to Harry that there would be exams with the castle in this state. There was a great deal of mutinous muttering around the room, which made Professor McGonagall scowl even more darkly. \"Professor Dumbledore\\'s instructions were to keep the school running as normally as possible, she said. \"And that, I need hardly point out, means finding out how much you have learned this year.\" Harry looked down at the pair of white rabbits he was supposed to be turning into slippers. What had he learned so far this year? He couldn\\'t seem to think of anything that would be useful in an exam. Ron looked as though he\\'d just been told he had to go and live in the Forbidden Forest. \"Can you imagine me taking exams with this?\" he asked Harry, holding up his wand, which had just started whistling loudly. Three days before their first exam, Professor McGonagall made another announcement at breakfast. \"I have good news,\" she said, and the Great Hall, instead of falling silent, erupted. \"Dumbledore\\'s coming back!\" several people yelled joyfully. \"You\\'ve caught the Heir of Slytherin!\" squealed a girl at the Ravenclaw table. \"Quidditch matches are back on!\" roared Wood excitedly. When the hubbub had subsided, Professor McGonagall said, \"Professor Sprout has informed me that the Mandrakes are ready for cutting at last. Tonight, we will be able to revive those people who have been Petrified. I need hardly remind you all that one of them may well be able to tell us who, or what, attacked them. I am hopeful that this dreadful year will end with our catching the culprit.\" There was an explosion of cheering. Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and wasn\\'t at all surprised to see that Draco Malfoy hadn\\'t joined in. Ron, however, was looking happier than he\\'d looked in days. \"It won\\'t matter that we never asked Myrtle, then!\" he said to Harry. \"Hermione\\'ll probably have all the answers when they wake her up! Mind you, she\\'ll go crazy when she finds out we\\'ve got exams in three days\\' time. She hasn\\'t studied. It might be kinder to leave her where she is till they\\'re over.\" Just then, Ginny Weasley came over and sat down next to Ron. She looked tense and nervous, and Harry noticed that her hands were twisting in her lap. \"What\\'s up?\" said Ron, helping himself to more porridge. Ginny didn\\'t say anything, but glanced up and down the Gryffindor table with a scared look on her face that reminded Harry of someone, though he couldn\\'t think who. \"Spit it out,\" said Ron, watching her. Harry suddenly realized who Ginny looked like. She was rocking backward and forward slightly in her chair, exactly like Dobby did when he was teetering on the edge of revealing forbidden information. \"I\\'ve got to tell you something,\" Ginny mumbled, carefully not looking at Harry. \"What is it?\" said Harry. Ginny looked as though she couldn\\'t find the right words. \"What?\" said Ron. Ginny opened her mouth, but no sound came out. Harry leaned forward and spoke quietly, so that only Ginny and Ron could hear him. \"Is it something about the Chamber of Secrets? Have you seen something? Someone acting oddly?\" Ginny drew a deep breath and, at that precise moment, Percy Weasley appeared, looking tired and wan. \"If you\\'ve finished eating, I\\'ll take that seat, Ginny. I\\'m starving, I\\'ve only just come off patrol duty.\" Ginny jumped up as though her chair had just been electrified, gave Percy a fleeting, frightened look, and scampered away. Percy sat down and grabbed a mug from the center of the table. \"Percy!\" said Ron angrily. \"She was just about to tell us something important!\" Halfway through a gulp of tea, Percy choked. \"What sort of thing?\" he said, coughing. \"I just asked her if she\\'d seen anything odd, and she started to say–\" \"Oh - that - that\\'s nothing to do with the Chamber of Secrets,\" said Percy at once. \"How do you know?\" said Ron, his eyebrows raised. \"Well, er, if you must know, Ginny, er, walked in on me the other day when I was - well, never mind - the point is, she spotted me doing something and I, um, I asked her not to mention it to anybody. I must say, I did think she\\'d keep her word. It\\'s nothing, really, I\\'d just rather - \" Harry had never seen Percy look so uncomfortable. \"What were you doing, Percy?\" said Ron, grinning. \"Go on, tell us, we won\\'t laugh.\" Percy didn\\'t smile back. \"Pass me those rolls, Harry, I\\'m starving.\" Harry knew the whole mystery might be solved tomorrow without their help, but he wasn\\'t about to pass up a chance to speak to Myrtle if it turned up - and to his delight it did, midmorning, when they were being led to History of Magic by Gilderoy Lockhart. Lockhart, who had so often assured them that all danger had passed, only to be proved wrong right away, was now wholeheartedly convinced that it was hardly worth the trouble to see them safely down the corridors. His hair wasn\\'t as sleek as usual; it seemed he had been up most of the night, patrolling the fourth floor. \"Mark my words,\" he said, ushering them around a corner. \"The first words out of those poor Petrified people\\'s mouths will be ‚It was Hagrid.\\' Frankly, I\\'m astounded Professor McGonagall thinks all these security measures are necessary.\" \"I agree, sir,\" said Harry, making Ron drop his books in surprise. \"Thank you, Harry,\" said Lockhart graciously while they waited for a long line of Hufflepuffs to pass. \"I mean, we teachers have quite enough to be getting on with, without walking students to classes and standing guard all night–\" \"That\\'s right,\" said Ron, catching on. \"Why don\\'t you leave us here, sir, we\\'ve only got one more corridor to go - \" \"You know, Weasley, I think I will,\" said Lockhart. \"I really should go and prepare my next class - \" And he hurried off. \"Prepare his class,\" Ron sneered after him. \"Gone to curl his hair, more like.\" They let the rest of the Gryffindors draw ahead of them, then darted down a side passage and hurried off toward Moaning Myrtle\\'s bathroom. But just as they were congratulating each other on their brilliant scheme. \"Potter! Weasley! What are you doing?\" It was Professor McGonagall, and her mouth was the thinnest of thin lines. \"We were - we were - \" Ron stammered. \"We were going to - to go and see - \" \"Hermione,\" said Harry. Ron and Professor McGonagall both looked at him. \"We haven\\'t seen her for ages, Professor,\" Harry went on hurriedly, treading on Ron\\'s foot, \"and we thought we\\'d sneak into the hospital wing, you know, and tell her the Mandrakes are nearly ready and, er, not to worry - \" Professor McGonagall was still staring at him, and for a moment, Harry thought she was going to explode, but when she spoke, it was in a strangely croaky voice. \"Of course,\" she said, and Harry, amazed, saw a tear glistening in her beady eye. \"Of course, I realize this has all been hardest on the friends of those who have been– I quite understand. Yes, Potter, of course you may visit Miss Granger. I will inform Professor Binns where you\\'ve gone. Tell Madam Pomfrey I have given my permission.\" Harry and Ron walked away, hardly daring to believe that they\\'d avoided detention. As they turned the corner, they distinctly heard Professor McGonagall blow her nose. \"That,\" said Ron fervently, \"was the best story you\\'ve ever come up with.\" They had no choice now but to go to the hospital wing and tell Madam Pomfrey that they had Professor McGonagall\\'s permission to visit Hermione. Madam Pomfrey let them in, but reluctantly. \"There\\'s just no point talking to a Petrified. person,\" she said, and they had to admit she had a point when they\\'d taken their seats next to Hermione. It was plain that Hermione didn\\'t have the faintest inkling that she had visitors, and that they might just as well tell her bedside cabinet not to worry for all the good it would do. \"Wonder if she did see the attacker, though?\" said Ron, looking sadly at Hermione\\'s rigid face. \"Because if he sneaked up on them all, no one\\'ll ever know–\" But Harry wasn\\'t looking at Hermione\\'s face. He was more interested in her right hand. It lay clenched on top of her blankets, and bending closer, he saw that a piece of paper was scrunched inside her fist. Making sure that Madam Pomfrey was nowhere near, he pointed this out to Ron. \"Go on and get it out,\" Ron whispered, shifting his chair so that he blocked Harry from Madam Pomfrey\\'s view. It was no easy task. Hermione\\'s hand was clamped so tightly around the paper that Harry was sure he was going to tear it. While Ron kept watch he tugged and twisted, and at last, after several tense minutes, the paper came free. It was a page torn from a very old library book. Harry smoothed it out eagerly and Ron leaned close to read it, too. \"Of the many fearsome beasts and monsters that roam our land, there is none more curious or more deadly than the Basilisk, known also as the King of Serpents. This snake, which may reach gigantic size and live many hundreds of years, is born from a chicken\\'s egg, hatched beneath a toad. Its methods of killing are most wondrous, for aside from its deadly and venomous fangs, the Basilisk has a murderous stare, and all who are fixed with the beam of its eye shall suffer instant death. Spiders flee before the Basilisk, for it is their mortal enemy, and the Basilisk flees only from the crowing of the rooster, which is fatal to it.\" And beneath this, a single word had been written, in a hand Harry recognized as Hermione\\'s. Pipes. It was as though somebody had just flicked a light on in his brain. \"Ron,\" he breathed. \"This is it. This is the answer. The monster in the Chamber\\'s a basilisk - a giant serpent! That\\'s why I\\'ve been hearing that voice all over the place, and nobody else has heard it. It\\'s because I understand Parseltongue–\" Harry looked up at the beds around him. \"The basilisk kills people by looking at them. But no one\\'s died - because no one looked it straight in the eye. Colin saw it through his camera. The basilisk burned up all the film inside it, but Colin just got Petrified. Justin– Justin must\\'ve seen the basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick! Nick got the full blast of it, but he couldn\\'t die again– and Hermione and that Ravenclaw prefect were found with a mirror next to them. Hermione had just realized the monster was a basilisk. I bet you anything she warned the first person she met to look around corners with a mirror first! And that girl pulled out her mirror - and - \" Rods jaw had dropped. \"And Mrs. Norris?\" he whispered eagerly. Harry thought hard, picturing the scene on the night of Halloween. \"The water–\" he said slowly. \"The flood from Moaning Myrtle\\'s bathroom. I bet you Mrs. Norris only saw the reflection–\" He scanned the page in his hand eagerly. The more he looked at it, the more it made sense. \"– The crowing of the rooster– is fatal to it\"! he read aloud. \"Hagrid\\'s roosters were killed! The Heir of Slytherin didn\\'t want one anywhere near the castle once the Chamber was opened! Spiders flee before it.! It all fits!\" \"But how\\'s the basilisk been getting around the place?\" said Ron. \"A giant snake– Someone would\\'ve seen–\" Harry, however, pointed at the word Hermione had scribbled at the foot of the page. \"Pipes,\" he said. \"Pipes– Ron, it\\'s been using the plumbing. I\\'ve been hearing that voice inside the walls–\" Ron suddenly grabbed Harry\\'s arm. \"The entrance to the Chamber of Secrets!\" he said hoarsely. \"What if it\\'s a bathroom? What if it\\'s in - \" \"Moaning Myrtle\\'s bathroom,\" said Harry. They sat there, excitement coursing through them, hardly able to believe it. \"This means,\" said Harry, \"I can\\'t be the only Parselmouth in the school. The Heir of Slytherin\\'s one, too. That\\'s how he\\'s been controlling the basilisk.\" \"What\\'re we going to do?\" said Ron, whose eyes were flashing. \"Should we go straight to McGonagall?\" \"Let\\'s go to the staff room,\" said Harry, jumping up. \"She\\'ll be there in ten minutes. It\\'s nearly break.\" They ran downstairs. Not wanting to be discovered hanging around in another corridor, they went straight into the deserted staff room. It was a large, paneled room full of dark, wooden chairs. Harry and Ron paced around it, too excited to sit down. But the bell to signal break never came. Instead, echoing through the corridors came Professor McGonagall\\'s voice, magically magnified. \"All students to return to their House dormitories at once. All teachers return to the staff room. Immediately, please.\" Harry wheeled around to stare at Ron. \"Not another attack? Not now?\" \"What\\'ll we do?\" said Ron, aghast. \"Go back to the dormitory?\" \"No,\" said Harry, glancing around. There was an ugly sort of wardrobe to his left, full of the teachers\\' cloaks. \"In here. Let\\'s hear what it\\'s all about. Then we can tell them what we\\'ve found out.\" They hid themselves inside it, listening to the rumbling of hundreds of people moving overhead, and the staff room door banging open. From between the musty folds of the cloaks, they watched the teachers filtering into the room. Some of them were looking puzzled, others downright scared. Then Professor McGonagall arrived. \"It has happened,\" she told the silent staff room. \"A student has been taken by the monster. Right into the Chamber itself.\" Professor Flitwick let out a squeal. Professor Sprout clapped her hands over her mouth. Snape gripped the back of a chair very hard and said, \"How can you be sure?\" \"The Heir of Slytherin,\" said Professor McGonagall, who was very white, \"left another message. Right underneath the first one. ‚Her skeleton will lie in the Chamber forever.\\' \" Professor Flitwick burst into tears. \"Who is it?\" said Madam Hooch, who had sunk, weak-kneed, into a chair. \"Which student?\" \"Ginny Weasley,\" said Professor McGonagall. Harry felt Ron slide silently down onto the wardrobe floor beside him. \"We shall have to send all the students home tomorrow,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"This is the end of Hogwarts. Dumbledore always said–\" The staffroom door banged open again. For one wild moment, Harry was sure it would be Dumbledore. But it was Lockhart, and he was beaming. \"So sorry - dozed off - what have I missed?\" He didn\\'t seem to notice that the other teachers were looking at him with something remarkably like hatred. Snape stepped forward. \"Just the man,\" he said. \"The very man. A girl has been snatched by the monster, Lockhart. Taken into the Chamber of Secrets itself. Your moment has come at last.\" Lockhart blanched. \"That\\'s right, Gilderoy,\" chipped in Professor Sprout. \"Weren\\'t you saying just last night that you\\'ve known all along where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?\" \"I - well, I - \"sputtered Lockhart. \"Yes, didn\\'t you tell me you were sure you knew what was inside it?\" piped up Professor Flitwick. \"D-did I? I don\\'t recall - \" \"I certainly remember you saying you were sorry you hadn\\'t had a crack at the monster before Hagrid was arrested,\" said Snape. \"Didn\\'t you say that the whole affair had been bungled, and that you should have been given a free rein from the first?\" Lockhart stared around at his stony-faced colleagues. \"I - I really never - you may have misunderstood - \" \"We\\'ll leave it to you, then, Gilderoy,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"Tonight will be an excellent time to do it. We\\'ll make sure everyone\\'s out of your way. You\\'ll be able to tackle the monster all by yourself. A free rein at last.\" Lockhart gazed desperately around him, but nobody came to the rescue. He didn\\'t look remotely handsome anymore. His lip was trembling, and in the absence of his usually toothy grin, he looked weak-chinned and feeble. \"V-very well,\" he said. \"I\\'ll - I\\'ll be in my office, getting - getting ready.\" And he left the room. \"Right,\" said Professor McGonagall, whose nostrils were flared, \"that\\'s got him out from under our feet. The Heads of Houses should go and inform their students what has happened. Tell them the Hogwarts Express will take them home first thing tomorrow. Will the rest of you please make sure no students have been left outside their dormitories.\" The teachers rose and left, one by one. It was probably the worst day of Harry\\'s entire life. He, Ron, Fred, and George sat together in a corner of the Gryffindor common room, unable to say anything to each other. Percy wasn\\'t there. He had gone to send an owl to Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, then shut himself up in his dormitory. No afternoon ever lasted as long as that one, nor had Gryffindor Tower ever been so crowded, yet so quiet. Near sunset, Fred and George went up to bed, unable to sit there any longer. \"She knew something, Harry,\" said Ron, speaking for the first time since they had entered the wardrobe in the staff room. \"That\\'s why she was taken. It wasn\\'t some stupid thing about Percy at all. She\\'d found out something about the Chamber of Secrets. That must be why she was - \" Ron rubbed his eyes frantically. \"I mean, she was a pure-blood. There can\\'t be any other reason.\" Harry could see the sun sinking, blood-red, below the skyline. This was the worst he had ever felt. If only there was something they could do. Anything. \"Harry\" said Ron. \"D\\'you think there\\'s any chance at all she\\'s not - you know - \" Harry didn\\'t know what to say. He couldn\\'t see how Ginny could still be alive. \"D\\'you know what?\" said Ron. \"I think we should go and see Lockhart. Tell him what we know. He\\'s going to try and get into the Chamber. We can tell him where we think it is, and tell him it\\'s a basilisk in there.\" Because Harry couldn\\'t think of anything else to do, and because he wanted to be doing something, he agreed. The Gryffindors around them were so miserable, and felt so sorry for the Weasleys, that nobody tried to stop them as they got up, crossed the room, and left through the portrait hole. Darkness was falling as they walked down to Lockhart\\'s office. There seemed to be a lot of activity going on inside it. They could hear scraping, thumps, and hurried footsteps. Harry knocked and there was a sudden silence from inside. Then the door opened the tiniest crack and they saw one of Lockhart\\'s eyes peering through it. \"Oh - Mr. Potter - Mr. Weasley - \" he said, opening the door a bit wider. \"I\\'m rather busy at the moment - if you would be quick - \" \"Professor, we\\'ve got some information for you,\" said Harry. \"We think it\\'ll help you.\" \"Er - well - it\\'s not terribly - \" The side of Lockhart\\'s face that they could see looked very uncomfortable. \"I mean - well - all right - \" He opened the door and they entered. His office had been almost completely stripped. Two large trunks stood open on the floor. Robes, jade-green, lilac, midnight blue, had been hastily folded into one of them; books were jumbled untidily into the other. The photographs that had covered the walls were now crammed into boxes on the desk. \"Are you going somewhere?\" said Harry. \"Er, well, yes,\" said Lockhart, ripping a life-size poster of himself from the back of the door as he spoke and starting to roll it up. \"Urgent call - unavoidable - got to go - \" \"What about my sister?\" said Ron jerkily. \"Well, as to that - most unfortunate - \" said Lockhart, avoiding their eyes as he wrenched open a drawer and started emptying the contents into a bag. \"No one regrets more than I - \" \"You\\'re the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher!\" said Harry. \"You can\\'t go now! Not with all the Dark stuff going on here!\" \"Well - I must say - when I took the job - \" Lockhart muttered, now piling socks on top of his robes. \"nothing in the job description - didn\\'t expect - \" \"You mean you\\'re running away?\" said Harry disbelievingly. \"After all that stuff you did in your books - \" \"Books can be misleading,\" said Lockhart delicately. \"You wrote them!\" Harry shouted. \"My dear boy,\" said Lockhart, straightening up and frowning at Harry. \"Do use your common sense. My books wouldn\\'t have sold half as well if people didn\\'t think I\\'d done all those things. No one wants to read about some ugly old Armenian warlock, even if he did save a village from werewolves. He\\'d look dreadful on the front cover. No dress sense at all. And the witch who banished the Bandon Banshee had a harelip. I mean, come on - \" \"So you\\'ve just been taking credit for what a load of other people have done?\" said Harry incredulously. \"Harry, Harry,\" said Lockhart, shaking his head impatiently, \"it\\'s not nearly as simple as that. There was work involved. I had to track these people down. Ask them exactly how they managed to do what they did. Then I had to put a Memory Charm on them so they wouldn\\'t remember doing it. If there\\'s one thing I pride myself on, it\\'s my Memory Charms. No, it\\'s been a lot of work, Harry. It\\'s not all book signings and publicity photos, you know. You want fame, you have to be prepared for a long hard slog.\" He banged the lids of his trunks shut and locked them. \"Let\\'s see,\" he said. \"I think that\\'s everything. Yes. Only one thing left.\" He pulled out his wand and turned to them. \"Awfully sorry, boys, but I\\'ll have to put a Memory Charm on you now. Can\\'t have you blabbing my secrets all over the place. I\\'d never sell another book - \" Harry reached his wand just in time. Lockhart had barely raised his, when Harry bellowed, \"Expelliarmus!\" Lockhart was blasted backward, falling over his trunk; his wand flew high into the air; Ron caught it, and flung it out of the open window. \"Shouldn\\'t have let Professor Snape teach us that one,\" said Harry furiously, kicking Lockhart\\'s trunk aside. Lockhart was looking up at him, feeble once more. Harry was still pointing his wand at him. \"What d\\'you want me to do?\" said Lockhart weakly. \"I don\\'t know where the Chamber of Secrets is. There\\'s nothing I can do.\" \"You\\'re in luck,\" said Harry, forcing Lockhart to his feet at wandpoint. \"We think we know where it is. And what\\'s inside it. Let\\'s go.\" They marched Lockhart out of his office and down the nearest stairs, along the dark corridor where the messages shone on the wall, to the door of Moaning Myrtle\\'s bathroom. They sent Lockhart in first. Harry was pleased to see that he was shaking. Moaning Myrtle was sitting on the tank of the end toilet. \"Oh, it\\'s you,\" she said when she saw Harry. \"What do you want this time?\" \"To ask you how you died,\" said Harry. Myrtle\\'s whole aspect changed at once. She looked as though she had never been asked such a flattering question. \"Ooooh, it was dreadful,\" she said with relish. \"It happened right in here. I died in this very stall. I remember it so well. I\\'d hidden because Olive Hornby was teasing me about my glasses. The door was locked, and I was crying, and then I heard somebody come in. They said something funny. A different language, I think it must have been. Anyway, what really got me was that it was a boy speaking. So I unlocked the door, to tell him to go and use his own toilet, and then - \" Myrtle swelled importantly, her face shining. \"I died.\" \"How?\" said Harry. \"No idea,\" said Myrtle in hushed tones. \"I just remember seeing a pair of great, big, yellow eyes. My whole body sort of seized up, and then I was floating away–\" She looked dreamily at Harry. \"And then I came back again. I was determined to haunt Olive Hornby, you see. Oh, she was sorry she\\'d ever laughed at my glasses.\" \"Where exactly did you see the eyes?\" said Harry. \"Somewhere there,\" said Myrtle, pointing vaguely toward the sink in front of her toilet. Harry and Ron hurried over to it. Lockhart was standing well back, a look of utter terror on his face. It looked like an ordinary sink. They examined every inch of it, inside and out, including the pipes below. And then Harry saw it: Scratched on the side of one of the copper taps was a tiny snake. \"That tap\\'s never worked,\" said Myrtle brightly as he tried to turn it. \"Harry,\" said Ron. \"Say something. Something in Parseltongue.\" \"But - \" Harry thought hard. The only times he\\'d ever managed to speak Parseltongue were when he\\'d been faced with a real snake. He stared hard at the tiny engraving, trying to imagine it was real. \"Open up,\" he said. He looked at Ron, who shook his head. \"English,\" he said. Harry looked back at the snake, willing himself to believe it was alive. If he moved his head, the candlelight made it look as though it were moving. \"Open up,\" he said. Except that the words weren\\'t what he heard; a strange hissing had escaped him, and at once the tap glowed with a brilliant white light and began to spin. Next second, the sink began to move; the sink, in fact, sank, right out of sight, leaving a large pipe exposed, a pipe wide enough for a man to slide into. Harry heard Ron gasp and looked up again. He had made up his mind what he was going to do. \"I\\'m going down there,\" he said. He couldn\\'t not go, not now they had found the entrance to the Chamber, not if there was even the faintest, slimmest, wildest chance that Ginny might be alive. \"Me too,\" said Ron. There was a pause. \"Well, you hardly seem to need me,\" said Lockhart, with a shadow of his old smile. \"I\\'ll just - \" He put his hand on the door knob, but Ron and Harry both pointed their wands at him. \"You can go first,\" Ron snarled. White-faced and wandless, Lockhart approached the opening. \"Boys,\" he said, his voice feeble. \"Boys, what good will it do?\" Harry jabbed him in the back with his wand. Lockhart slid his legs into the pipe. \"I really don\\'t think - \" he started to say, but Ron gave him a push, and he slid out of sight. Harry followed quickly. He lowered himself slowly into the pipe, then let go. It was like rushing down an endless, slimy, dark slide. He could see more pipes branching off in all directions, but none as large as theirs, which twisted and turned, sloping steeply downward, and he knew that he was falling deeper below the school than even the dungeons. Behind him he could hear Ron, thudding slightly at the curves. And then, just as he had begun to worry about what would happen when he hit the ground, the pipe leveled out, and he shot out of the end with a wet thud, landing on the damp floor of a dark stone tunnel large enough to stand in. Lockhart was getting to his feet a little ways away, covered in slime and white as a ghost. Harry stood aside as Ron came whizzing out of the pipe, too. \"We must be miles under the school,\" said Harry, his voice echoing in the black tunnel. \"Under the lake, probably,\" said Ron, squinting around at the dark, slimy walls. All three of them turned to stare into the darkness ahead. \"Lumos!\" Harry muttered to his wand and it lit again. \"C\\'mon,\" he said to Ron and Lockhart, and off they went, their footsteps slapping loudly on the wet floor. The tunnel was so dark that they could only see a little distance ahead. Their shadows on the wet walls looked monstrous in the wandlight. \"Remember,\" Harry said quietly as they walked cautiously forward, \"any sign of movement, close your eyes right away–\" But the tunnel was quiet as the grave, and the first unexpected sound they heard was a loud crunch as Ron stepped on what turned out to be a rat\\'s skull. Harry lowered his wand to look at the floor and saw that it was littered with small animal bones. Trying very hard not to imagine what Ginny might look like if they found her, Harry led the way forward, around a dark bend in the tunnel. \"Harry - there\\'s something up there - \" said Ron hoarsely, grabbing Harry\\'s shoulder. They froze, watching. Harry could just see the outline of something huge and curved, lying right across the tunnel. It wasn\\'t moving. \"Maybe it\\'s asleep,\" he breathed, glancing back at the other two. Lockhart\\'s hands were pressed over his eyes. Harry turned back to look at the thing, his heart beating so fast it hurt. Very slowly, his eyes as narrow as he could make them and still see, Harry edged forward, his wand held high. The light slid over a gigantic snake skin, of a vivid, poisonous green, lying curled and empty across the tunnel floor. The creature that had shed it must have been twenty feet long at least. \"Blimey,\" said Ron weakly. There was a sudden movement behind them. Gilderoy Lockhart\\'s knees had given way. \"Get up,\" said Ron sharply, pointing his wand at Lockhart. Lockhart got to his feet - then he dived at Ron, knocking him to the ground. Harry jumped forward, but too late - Lockhart was straightening up, panting, Ron\\'s wand in his hand and a gleaming smile back on his face. \"The adventure ends here, boys!\" he said. \"I shall take a bit of this skin back up to the school, tell them I was too late to save the girl, and that you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of her mangled body - say good-bye to your memories!\" He raised Ron\\'s Spellotaped wand high over his head and yelled, \"Obliviate!\" The wand exploded with the force of a small bomb. Harry flung his arms over his head and ran, slipping over the coils of snake skin, out of the way of great chunks of tunnel ceiling that were thundering to the floor. Next moment, he was standing alone, gazing at a solid wall of broken rock. \"Ron!\" he shouted. \"Are you okay? Ron!\" \"I\\'m here!\" came Ron\\'s muffled voice from behind the rockfall. \"I\\'m okay - this git\\'s not, though - he got blasted by the wand - \" There was a dull thud and a loud \"ow!\" It sounded as though Ron had just kicked Lockhart in the shins. \"What now?\" Ron\\'s voice said, sounding desperate. \"We can\\'t get through - it\\'ll take ages–\" Harry looked up at the tunnel ceiling. Huge cracks had appeared in it. He had never tried to break apart anything as large as these rocks by magic, and now didn\\'t seem a good moment to try - what if the whole tunnel caved in? There was another thud and another \"ow!\" from behind the rocks. They were wasting time. Ginny had already been in the Chamber of Secrets for hours– Harry knew there was only one thing to do. \"Wait there,\" he called to Ron. \"Wait with Lockhart. I\\'ll go on– If I\\'m not back in an hour–\" There was a very pregnant pause, \"I\\'ll try and shift some of this rock,\" said Ron, who seemed to be trying to keep his voice steady. \"So you can - can get back through. And, Harry - \" \"See you in a bit,\" said Harry, trying to inject some confidence into his shaking voice. And he set off alone past the giant snake skin. Soon the distant noise of Ron straining to shift the rocks was gone. The tunnel turned and turned again. Every nerve in Harry\\'s body was tingling unpleasantly. He wanted the tunnel to end, yet dreaded what he\\'d find when it did. And then, at last, as he crept around yet another bend, he saw a solid wall ahead on which two entwined serpents were carved, their eyes set with great, glinting emeralds. Harry approached, his throat very dry. There was no need to pretend these stone snakes were real; their eyes looked strangely alive. He could guess what he had to do. He cleared his throat, and the emerald eyes seemed to flicker. \"Open,\" said Harry, in a low, faint hiss. The serpents parted as the wall cracked open, the halves slid smoothly out of sight, and Harry, shaking from head to foot, walked inside. CHAPTER SEVENTEEN The Heir of Slytherin He was standing at the end of a very long, dimly lit chamber. Towering stone pillars entwined with more carved serpents rose to support a ceiling lost in darkness, casting long, black shadows through the odd, greenish gloom that filled the place. His heart beating very fast, Harry stood listening to the chill silence. Could the basilisk be lurking in a shadowy corner, behind a pillar? And where was Ginny? He pulled out his wand and moved forward between the serpentine columns. Every careful footstep echoed loudly off the shadowy walls. He kept his eyes narrowed, ready to clamp them shut at the smallest sign of movement. The hollow eye sockets of the stone snakes seemed to be following him. More than once, with a jolt of the stomach, he thought he saw one stir. Then, as he drew level with the last pair of pillars, a statue high as the Chamber itself loomed into view, standing against the back wall. Harry had to crane his neck to look up into the giant face above: It was ancient and monkeyish, with a long, thin beard that fell almost to the bottom of the wizard\\'s sweeping stone robes, where two enormous gray feet stood on the smooth Chamber floor. And between the feet, facedown, lay a small, black-robed figure with flaming-red hair. \"Ginny!\" Harry muttered, sprinting to her and dropping to his knees. \"Ginny - don\\'t be dead - please don\\'t be dead - \" He flung his wand aside, grabbed Ginny\\'s shoulders, and turned her over. Her face was white as marble, and as cold, yet her eyes were closed, so she wasn\\'t Petrified. But then she must be– \"Ginny, please wake up,\" Harry muttered desperately, shaking her. Ginny\\'s head lolled hopelessly from side to side. \"She won\\'t wake,\" said a soft voice. Harry jumped and spun around on his knees. A tall, black-haired boy was leaning against the nearest pillar, watching. He was strangely blurred around the edges, as though Harry were looking at him through a misted window. But there was no mistaking him. \"Tom - Tom Riddle?\" Riddle nodded, not taking his eyes off Harry\\'s face. \"What d\\'you mean, she won\\'t wake?\" Harry said desperately. \"She\\'s not - she\\'s not - ?\" \"She\\'s still alive,\" said Riddle. \"But only just.\" Harry stared at him. Tom Riddle had been at Hogwarts fifty years ago, yet here he stood, a weird, misty light shining about him, not a day older than sixteen. \"Are you a ghost?\" Harry said uncertainly. \"A memory,\" said Riddle quietly. \"Preserved in a diary for fifty years.\" He pointed toward the floor near the statue\\'s giant toes. Lying open there was the little black diary Harry had found in Moaning Myrtle\\'s bathroom. For a second, Harry wondered how it had got there - but there were more pressing matters to deal with. \"You\\'ve got to help me, Tom,\" Harry said, raising Ginny\\'s head again. \"We\\'ve got to get her out of here. There\\'s a basilisk– I don\\'t know where it is, but it could be along any moment– Please, help me.\" Riddle didn\\'t move. Harry, sweating, managed to hoist Ginny half off the floor, and bent to pick up his wand again. But his wand had gone. \"Did you see - ?\" He looked up. Riddle was still watching him - twirling Harry\\'s wand between his long fingers. \"Thanks,\" said Harry, stretching out his hand for it. A smile curled the corners of Riddle\\'s mouth. He continued to stare at Harry, twirling the wand idly. \"Listen,\" said Harry urgently, his knees sagging with Ginny\\'s dead weight. \"We\\'ve got to go! If the basilisk comes - \" \"It won\\'t come until it is called,\" said Riddle calmly. Harry lowered Ginny back onto the floor, unable to hold her up any longer. \"What d\\'you mean?\" he said. \"Look, give me my wand, I might need it - \" Riddle\\'s smile broadened. \"You won\\'t be needing it,\" he said. Harry stared at him. \"What d\\'you mean, I won\\'t be - ?\" \"I\\'ve waited a long time for this, Harry Potter,\" said Riddle. \"For the chance to see you. To speak to you.\" \"Look,\" said Harry, losing patience, \"I don\\'t think you get it. We\\'re in the Chamber of Secrets. We can talk later - \" \"We\\'re going to talk now,\" said Riddle, still smiling broadly, and he pocketed Harry\\'s wand. Harry stared at him. There was something very funny going on here– \"How did Ginny get like this?\" he asked slowly. \"Well, that\\'s an interesting question,\" said Riddle pleasantly. \"And quite a long story. I suppose the real reason Ginny Weasley\\'s like this is because she opened her heart and spilled all her secrets to an invisible stranger.\" \"What are you talking about?\" said Harry. \"The diary,\" said Riddle. \"My diary. Little Ginny\\'s been writing in it for months and months, telling me all her pitiful worries and woes - how her brothers tease her, how she had to come to school with secondhand robes and books, how - \" Riddle\\'s eyes glinted \" - how she didn\\'t think famous, good, great Harry Potter would ever like her–\" All the time he spoke, Riddle\\'s eyes never left Harry\\'s face. There was an almost hungry look in them. \"It\\'s very boring, having to listen to the silly little troubles of an eleven-year-old girl,\" he went on. \"But I was patient. I wrote back. I was sympathetic, I was kind. Ginny simply loved me. No one\\'s ever understood me like you, Tom– I\\'m so glad I\\'ve got this diary to confide in– It\\'s like having a friend I can carry around in my pocket–\" Riddle laughed, a high, cold laugh that didn\\'t suit him. It made the hairs stand up on the back of Harry\\'s neck. \"If I say it myself, Harry, I\\'ve always been able to charm the people I needed. So Ginny poured out her soul to me, and her soul happened to be exactly what I wanted– I grew stronger and stronger on a diet of her deepest fears, her darkest secrets. I grew powerful, far more powerful than little Miss Weasley. Powerful enough to start feeding Miss Weasley a few of my secrets, to start pouring a little of my soul back into her–\" \"What d\\'you mean?\" said Harry, whose mouth had gone very dry. \"Haven\\'t you guessed yet, Harry Potter?\" said Riddle softly. \"Ginny Weasley opened the Chamber of Secrets. She strangled the school roosters and daubed threatening messages on the walls. She set the Serpent of Slytherin on four Mudbloods, and the Squib\\'s cat.\" \"No,\" Harry whispered. \"Yes,\" said Riddle, calmly. \"Of course, she didn\\'t know what she was doing at first. It was very amusing. I wish you could have seen her new diary entries– far more interesting, they became– Dear Tom,\" he recited, watching Harry\\'s horrified face, \"‚I think I\\'m losing my memory. There are rooster feathers all over my robes and I don\\'t know how they got there. Dear Tom, I can\\'t remember what I did on the night of Halloween, but a cat was attacked and I\\'ve got paint all down my front. Dear Tom, Percy keeps telling me I\\'m pale and I\\'m not myself. I think he suspects me– There was another attack today and I don\\'t know where I was. Tom, what am I going to do? I think I\\'m going mad– I think I\\'m the one attacking everyone, Tom!\\'\" Harry\\'s fists were clenched, the nails digging deep into his palms. \"It took a very long time for stupid little Ginny to stop trusting her diary,\" said Riddle. \"But she finally became suspicious and tried to dispose of it. And that\\'s where you came in, Harry. You found it, and I couldn\\'t have been more delighted. Of all the people who could have picked it up, it was you, the very person I was most anxious to meet–\" \"And why did you want to meet me?\" said Harry. Anger was coursing through him, and it was an effort to keep his voice steady. \"Well, you see, Ginny told me all about you, Harry,\" said Riddle. \"Your whole fascinating history.\" His eyes roved over the lightning scar on Harry\\'s forehead, and their expression grew hungrier. \"I knew I must find out more about you, talk to you, meet you if I could. So I decided to show you my famous capture of that great oaf, Hagrid, to gain your trust - \" \"Hagrid\\'s my friend,\" said Harry, his voice now shaking. \"And you framed him, didn\\'t you? I thought you made a mistake, but - \" Riddle laughed his high laugh again. \"It was my word against Hagrid\\'s, Harry. Well, you can imagine how it looked to old Armando Dippet. On the one hand, Tom Riddle, poor but brilliant, parentless but so brave, school prefect, model student– on the other hand, big, blundering Hagrid, in trouble every other week, trying to raise werewolf cubs under his bed, sneaking off to the Forbidden Forest to wrestle trolls– but I admit, even I was surprised how well the plan worked. I thought someone must realize that Hagrid couldn\\'t possibly be the Heir of Slytherin. It had taken me five whole years to find out everything I could about the Chamber of Secrets and discover the secret entrance– as though Hagrid had the brains, or the power! \"Only the Transfiguration teacher, Dumbledore, seemed to think Hagrid was innocent. He persuaded Dippet to keep Hagrid and train him as gamekeeper. Yes, I think Dumbledore might have guessed– Dumbledore never seemed to like me as much as the other teachers did–\" \"I bet Dumbledore saw right through you,\" said Harry, his teeth gritted. \"Well, he certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after Hagrid was expelled,\" said Riddle carelessly. \"I knew it wouldn\\'t be safe to open the Chamber again while I was still at school. But I wasn\\'t going to waste those long years I\\'d spent searching for it. I decided to leave behind a diary, preserving my sixteen-year-old self in its pages, so that one day, with luck, I would be able to lead another in my footsteps, and finish Salazar Slytherin\\'s noble work.\" \"Well, you haven\\'t finished it,\" said Harry triumphantly. \"No one\\'s died this time, not even the cat. In a few hours the Mandrake Draught will be ready and everyone who was Petrified will be all right again - \" \"Haven\\'t I already told you,\" said Riddle quietly, \"that killing Mudbloods doesn\\'t matter to me anymore? For many months now, my new target has been - you.\" Harry stared at him. \"Imagine how angry I was when the next time my diary was opened, it was Ginny who was writing to me, not you. She saw you with the diary, you see, and panicked. What if you found out how to work it, and I repeated all her secrets to you? What if, even worse, I told you who\\'d been strangling roosters? So the foolish little brat waited until your dormitory was deserted and stole it back. But I knew what I must do. It was clear to me that you were on the trail of Slytherin\\'s heir. From everything Ginny had told me about you, I knew you would go to any lengths to solve the mystery - particularly if one of your best friends was attacked. And Ginny had told me the whole school was buzzing because you could speak Parseltongue– \"So I made Ginny write her own farewell on the wall and come down here to wait. She struggled and cried and became very boring. But there isn\\'t much life left in her– She put too much into the diary, into me. Enough to let me leave its pages at last– I have been waiting for you to appear since we arrived here. I knew you\\'d come. I have many questions for you, Harry Potter.\" \"Like what?\" Harry spat, fists still clenched. \"Well,\" said Riddle, smiling pleasantly, \"how is it that you - a skinny boy with no extraordinary magical talent - managed to defeat the greatest wizard of all time? How did you escape with nothing but a scar, while Lord Voldemort\\'s powers were destroyed?\" There was an odd red gleam in his hungry eyes now. \"Why do you care how I escaped?\" said Harry slowly. \"Voldemort was after your time–\" \"Voldemort,\" said Riddle softly, \"is my past, present, and future, Harry Potter–\" He pulled Harry\\'s wand from his pocket and began to trace it through the air, writing three shimmering words: TOM MARVOLO RIDDLE Then he waved the wand once, and the letters of his name rearranged themselves: I AM LORD VOLDEMORT \"You see?\" he whispered. \"It was a name I was already using at Hogwarts, to my most intimate friends only, of course. You think I was going to use my filthy Muggle father\\'s name forever? I, in whose veins runs the blood of Salazar Slytherin himself, through my mother\\'s side? I, keep the name of a foul, common Muggle, who abandoned me even before I was born, just because he found out his wife was a witch? No, Harry - I fashioned myself a new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak, when I had become the greatest sorcerer in the world!\" Harry\\'s brain seemed to have jammed. He stared numbly at Riddle, at the orphaned boy who had grown up to murder Harry\\'s own parents, and so many others– At last he forced himself to speak. \"You\\'re not,\" he said, his quiet voice full of hatred. \"Not what?\" snapped Riddle. \"Not the greatest sorcerer in the world,\" said Harry, breathing fast. \"Sorry to disappoint you and all that, but the greatest wizard in the world is Albus Dumbledore. Everyone says so. Even when you were strong, you didn\\'t dare try and take over at Hogwarts. Dumbledore saw through you when you were at school and he still frightens you now, wherever you\\'re hiding these days - \" The smile had gone from Riddle\\'s face, to be replaced by a very ugly look. \"Dumbledore\\'s been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me!\" he hissed. \"He\\'s not as gone as you might think!\" Harry retorted. He was speaking at random, wanting to scare Riddle, wishing rather than believing it to be true. Riddle opened his mouth, but froze. Music was coming from somewhere. Riddle whirled around to stare down the empty Chamber. The music was growing louder. It was eerie, spine-tingling, unearthly; it lifted the hair on Harry\\'s scalp and made his heart feel as though it was swelling to twice its normal size. Then, as the music reached such a pitch that Harry felt it vibrating inside his own ribs, flames erupted at the top of the nearest pillar. A crimson bird the size of a swan had appeared, piping its weird music to the vaulted ceiling. It had a glittering golden tail as long as a peacock\\'s and gleaming golden talons, which were gripping a ragged bundle. A second later, the bird was flying straight at Harry. It dropped the ragged thing it was carrying at his feet, then landed heavily on his shoulder. As it folded its great wings, Harry looked up and saw it had a long, sharp golden beak and a beady black eye. The bird stopped singing. It sat still and warm next to Harry\\'s cheek, gazing steadily at Riddle. \"That\\'s a phoenix.\" said Riddle, staring shrewdly back at it. \"Fawkes?\" Harry breathed, and he felt the bird\\'s golden claws squeeze his shoulder gently. \"And that - \" said Riddle, now eyeing the ragged thing that Fawkes had dropped, \"that\\'s the old school Sorting Hat - \" So it was. Patched, frayed, and dirty, the hat lay motionless at Harry\\'s feet. Riddle began to laugh again. He laughed so hard that the dark chamber rang with it, as though ten Riddles were laughing at once. \"This is what Dumbledore sends his defender! A songbird and an old hat! Do you feel brave, Harry Potter? Do you feel safe now?\" Harry didn\\'t answer. He might not see what use Fawkes or the Sorting Hat were, but he was no longer alone, and he waited for Riddle to stop laughing with his courage mounting. \"To business, Harry,\" said Riddle, still smiling broadly. \"Twice - in your past, in my future - we have met. And twice I failed to kill you. How did you survive? Tell me everything. The longer you talk,\" he added softly, \"the longer you stay alive.\" Harry was thinking fast, weighing his chances. Riddle had the wand. He, Harry, had Fawkes and the Sorting Hat, neither of which would be much good in a duel. It looked bad, all right– but the longer Riddle stood there, the more life was dwindling out of Ginny– and in the meantime, Harry noticed suddenly, Riddle\\'s outline was becoming clearer, more solid– If it had to be a fight between him and Riddle, better sooner than later. \"No one knows why you lost your powers when you attacked me,\" said Harry abruptly. \"I don\\'t know myself. But I know why you couldn\\'t kill me. Because my mother died to save me. My common Muggle-born mother,\" he added, shaking with suppressed rage. \"She stopped you killing me. And I\\'ve seen the real you, I saw you last year. You\\'re a wreck. You\\'re barely alive. That\\'s where all your power got you. You\\'re in hiding. You\\'re ugly, you\\'re foul - \" Riddle\\'s face contorted. Then he forced it into an awful smile. \"So. Your mother died to save you. Yes, that\\'s a powerful countercharm. I can see now– there is nothing special about you, after all. I wondered, you see. There are strange likenesses between us, after all. Even you must have noticed. Both half-bloods, orphans, raised by Muggles. Probably the only two Parselmouths to come to Hogwarts since the great Slytherin himself. We even look something alike– but after all, it was merely a lucky chance that saved you from me. That\\'s all I wanted to know.\" Harry stood, tense, waiting for Riddle to raise his wand. But Riddle\\'s twisted smile was widening again. \"Now, Harry, I\\'m going to teach you a little lesson. Let\\'s match the powers of Lord Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin, against famous Harry Potter, and the best weapons Dumbledore can give him–\" He cast an amused eye over Fawkes and the Sorting Hat, then walked away. Harry, fear spreading up his numb legs, watched Riddle stop between the high pillars and look up into the stone face of Slytherin, high above him in the half-darkness. Riddle opened his mouth wide and hissed - but Harry understood what he was saying– \"Speak to me, Slytherin, greatest of the Hogwarts Four.\" Harry wheeled around to look up at the statue, Fawkes swaying on his shoulder. Slytherin\\'s gigantic stone face was moving. Horrorstruck, Harry saw his mouth opening, wider and wider, to make a huge black hole. And something was stirring inside the statue\\'s mouth. Something was slithering up from its depths. Harry backed away until he hit the dark Chamber wall, and as he shut his eyes tight he felt Fawkes\\' wing sweep his cheek as he took flight. Harry wanted to shout, \"Don\\'t leave me!\" but what chance did a phoenix have against the king of serpents? Something huge hit the stone floor of the Chamber. Harry felt it shudder - he knew what was happening, he could sense it, could almost see the giant serpent uncoiling itself from Slytherin\\'s mouth. Then he heard Riddle\\'s hissing voice: \"Kill him.\" The basilisk was moving toward Harry; he could hear its heavy body slithering heavily across the dusty floor. Eyes still tightly shut, Harry began to run blindly sideways, his hands outstretched, feeling his way - Voldemort was laughing. Harry tripped. He fell hard onto the stone and tasted blood the serpent was barely feet from him, he could hear it coming. There was a loud, explosive spitting sound right above him, and then something heavy hit Harry so hard that he was smashed into the wall. Waiting for fangs to sink through his body he heard more mad hissing, something thrashing wildly off the pillars. He couldn\\'t help it - he opened his eyes wide enough to squint at what was going on. The enormous serpent, bright, poisonous green, thick as an oak trunk, had raised itself high in the air and its great blunt head was weaving drunkenly between the pillars. As Harry trembled, ready to close his eyes if it turned, he saw what had distracted the snake. Fawkes was soaring around its head, and the basilisk was snapping furiously at him with fangs long and thin as sabers Fawkes dived. His long golden beak sank out of sight and a sudden shower of dark blood spattered the floor. The snake\\'s tail thrashed, narrowly missing Harry, and before Harry could shut his eyes, it turned - Harry looked straight into its face and saw that its eyes, both its great, bulbous yellow eyes, had been punctured by the phoenix; blood was streaming to the floor, and the snake was spitting in agony. \"NO!\" Harry heard Riddle screaming. \"LEAVE THE BIRD! LEAVE THE BIRD! THE BOY IS BEHIND YOU. YOU CAN STILL SMELL HIM. KILL HIM!\" The blinded serpent swayed, confused, still deadly. Fawkes was circling its head, piping his eerie song, jabbing here and there at its scaly nose as the blood poured from its ruined eyes. \"Help me, help me,\" Harry muttered wildly, \"someone - anyone–\" The snake\\'s tail whipped across the floor again. Harry ducked. Something soft hit his face. The basilisk had swept the Sorting Hat into Harry\\'s arms. Harry seized it. It was all he had left, his only chance - he rammed it onto his head and threw himself flat onto the floor as the basilisk\\'s tail swung over him again. Help me - help me - Harry thought, his eyes screwed tight under the hat. Please help me. There was no answering voice. Instead, the hat contracted, as though an invisible hand was squeezing it very tightly. Something very hard and heavy thudded onto the top of Harry\\'s head, almost knocking him out. Stars winking in front of his eyes, he grabbed the top of the hat to pull it off and felt something long and hard beneath it. A gleaming silver sword had appeared inside the hat, its handle glittering with rubies the size of eggs. \"KILL THE BOY! LEAVE THE BIRD! THE BOY IS BEHIND YOU. SNIFF - SMELL HIM.\" Harry was on his feet, ready. The basilisk\\'s head was falling, its body coiling around, hitting pillars as it twisted to face him. He could see the vast, bloody eye sockets, see the mouth stretching wide, wide enough to swallow him whole, lined with fangs long as his sword, thin, glittering, venomous - It lunged blindly - Harry dodged and it hit the Chamber wall. It lunged again, and its forked tongue lashed Harry\\'s side. He raised the sword in both his hands - The basilisk lunged again, and this time its aim was true - Harry threw his whole weight behind the sword and drove it to the hilt into the roof of the serpent\\'s mouth - But as warm blood drenched Harry\\'s arms, he felt a searing pain just above his elbow. One long, poisonous fang was sinking deeper and deeper into his arm and it splintered as the basilisk keeled over sideways and fell, twitching, to the floor. Harry slid down the wall. He gripped the fang that was spreading poison through his body and wrenched it out of his arm. But he knew it was too late. White-hot pain was spreading slowly and steadily from the wound. Even as he dropped the fang and watched his own blood soaking his robes, his vision went foggy. The Chamber was dissolving in a whirl of dull color. A patch of scarlet swam past, and Harry heard a soft clatter of claws beside him. \"Fawkes,\" said Harry thickly. \"You were fantastic, Fawkes–\" He felt the bird lay its beautiful head on the spot where the serpent\\'s fang had pierced him. He could hear echoing footsteps and then a dark shadow moved in front of him. \"You\\'re dead, Harry Potter,\" said Riddle\\'s voice above him. \"Dead. Even Dumbledore\\'s bird knows it. Do you see what he\\'s doing, Potter? He\\'s crying.\" Harry blinked. Fawke\\'s head slid in and out of focus. Thick, pearly tears were trickling down the glossy feathers. \"I\\'m going to sit here and watch you die, Harry Potter. Take your time. I\\'m in no hurry.\" Harry felt drowsy. Everything around him seemed to be spinning. \"So ends the famous Harry Potter,\" said Riddle\\'s distant voice. \"Alone in the Chamber of Secrets, forsaken by his friends, defeated at last by the Dark Lord he so unwisely challenged. You\\'ll be back with your dear Mudblood mother soon, Harry– She bought you twelve years of borrowed time– but Lord Voldemort got you in the end, as you knew he must–\" If this is dying, thought Harry, it\\'s not so bad. Even the pain was leaving him– But was this dying? Instead of going black, the Chamber seemed to be coming back into focus. Harry gave his head a little shake and there was Fawkes, still resting his head on Harry\\'s arm. A pearly patch of tears was shining all around the wound - except that there was no wound. \"Get away, bird,\" said Riddle\\'s voice suddenly. \"Get away from him - I said, get away - \" Harry raised his head. Riddle was pointing Harry\\'s wand at Fawkes; there was a bang like a gun, and Fawkes took flight again in a whirl of gold and scarlet. \"Phoenix tears–\" said Riddle quietly, staring at Harry\\'s arm. \"Of course– healing powers– I forgot–\" He looked into Harry\\'s face. \"But it makes no difference. In fact, I prefer it this way. Just you and me, Harry Potter– you and me–\" He raised the wand– Then, in a rush of wings, Fawkes had soared back overhead and something fell into Harry\\'s lap - the diary. For a split second, both Harry and Riddle, wand still raised, stared at it. Then, without thinking, without considering, as though he had meant to do it all along, Harry seized the basilisk fang on the floor next to him and plunged it straight into the heart of the book. There was a long, dreadful, piercing scream. Ink spurted out of the diary in torrents, streaming over Harry\\'s hands, flooding the floor. Riddle was writhing and twisting, screaming and flailing and then - He had gone. Harry\\'s wand fell to the floor with a clatter and there was silence. Silence except for the steady drip drip of ink still oozing from the diary. The basilisk venom had burned a sizzling hole right through it. Shaking all over, Harry pulled himself up. His head was spinning as though he\\'d just traveled miles by Floo powder. Slowly, he gathered together his wand and the Sorting Hat, and, with a huge tug, retrieved the glittering sword from the roof of the basilisk\\'s mouth. Then came a faint moan from the end of the Chamber. Ginny was stirring. As Harry hurried toward her, she sat up. Her bemused eyes traveled from the huge form of the dead basilisk, over Harry, in his blood-soaked robes, then to the diary in his hand. She drew a great, shuddering gasp and tears began to pour down her face. \"Harry - oh, Harry - I tried to tell you at b-breakfast, but I c-couldn\\'t say it in front of Percy - it was me, Harry - but I - I s-swear I d-didn\\'t mean to - R-Riddle made me, he t-took me over - and - how did you kill that - that thing? W-where\\'s Riddle? The last thing I r-remember is him coming out of the diary - \" \" It\\'s all right,\" said Harry, holding up the diary, and showing Ginny the fang hole, \"Riddle\\'s finished. Look! Him and the basilisk. C\\'mon, Ginny, let\\'s get out of here - \" \"I\\'m going to be expelled!\" Ginny wept as Harry helped her awkwardly to her feet. \"I\\'ve looked forward to coming to Hogwarts ever since B-Bill came and n-now I\\'ll have to leave and - w-what\\'ll Mum and Dad say?\" Fawkes was waiting for them, hovering in the Chamber entrance. Harry urged Ginny forward; they stepped over the motionless coils of the dead basilisk, through the echoing gloom, and back into the tunnel. Harry heard the stone doors close behind them with a soft hiss. After a few minutes\\' progress up the dark tunnel, a distant sound of slowly shifting rock reached Harry\\'s ears. \"Ron!\" Harry yelled, speeding up. \"Ginny\\'s okay! I\\'ve got her!\" He heard Ron give a strangled cheer, and they turned the next bend to see his eager face staring through the sizable gap he had managed to make in the rock fall. \"Ginny!\" Ron thrust an arm through the gap in the rock to pull her through first. \"You\\'re alive! I don\\'t believe it! What happened? How - what - where did that bird come from?\" Fawkes had swooped through the gap after Ginny. \"He\\'s Dumbledore\\'s,\" said Harry, squeezing through himself. \"How come you\\'ve got a sword?\" said Ron, gaping at the glittering weapon in Harry\\'s hand. \"I\\'ll explain when we get out of here,\" said Harry with a sideways glance at Ginny, who was crying harder than ever. \"But - \" \"Later,\" Harry said shortly. He didn\\'t think it was a good idea to tell Ron yet who\\'d been opening the Chamber, not in front of Ginny, anyway. \"Where\\'s Lockhart?\" \"Back there,\" said Ron, still looking puzzled but jerking his head up the tunnel toward the pipe. \"He\\'s in a bad way. Come and see.\" Led by Fawkes, whose wide scarlet wings emitted a soft golden glow in the darkness, they walked all the way back to the mouth of the pipe. Gilderoy Lockhart was sitting there, humming placidly to himself. \"His memory\\'s gone,\" said Ron. \"The Memory Charm backfired. Hit him instead of us. Hasn\\'t got a clue who he is, or where he is, or who we are. I told him to come and wait here. He\\'s a danger to himself.\" Lockhart peered good-naturedly up at them all. \"Hello,\" he said. \"Odd sort of place, this, isn\\'t it? Do you live here?\" \"No,\" said Ron, raising his eyebrows at Harry. Harry bent down and looked up the long, dark pipe. \"Have you thought how we\\'re going to get back up this?\" he said to Ron. Ron shook his head, but Fawkes the phoenix had swooped past Harry and was now fluttering in front of him, his beady eyes bright in the dark. He was waving his long golden tail feathers. Harry looked uncertainly at him. \"He looks like he wants you to grab hold–\" said Ron, looking perplexed. \"But you\\'re much too heavy for a bird to pull up there - \" \"Fawkes,\" said Harry, \"isn\\'t an ordinary bird.\" He turned quickly to the others. \"We\\'ve got to hold on to each other. Ginny, grab Ron\\'s hand. Professor Lockhart - \" \"He means you,\" said Ron sharply to Lockhart. \"You hold Ginny\\'s other hand - \" Harry tucked the sword and the Sorting Hat into his belt, Ron took hold of the back of Harry\\'s robes, and Harry reached out and took hold of Fawkes\\'s strangely hot tail feathers. An extraordinary lightness seemed to spread through his whole body and the next second, in a rush of wings, they were flying upward through the pipe. Harry could hear Lockhart dangling below him, saying, \"Amazing! Amazing! This is just like magic!\" The chill air was whipping through Harry\\'s hair, and before he\\'d stopped enjoying the ride, it was over - all four of them were hitting the wet floor of Moaning Myrtle\\'s bathroom, and as Lockhart straightened his hat, the sink that hid the pipe was sliding back into place. Myrtle goggled at them. \"You\\'re alive,\" she said blankly to Harry. \"There\\'s no need to sound so disappointed,\" he said grimly, wiping flecks of blood and slime off his glasses. \"Oh, well– I\\'d just been thinking– if you had died, you\\'d have been welcome to share my toilet,\" said Myrtle, blushing silver. \"Urgh!\" said Ron as they left the bathroom for the dark, deserted corridor outside. \"Harry! I think Myrtle\\'s grown fond of you! You\\'ve got competition, Ginny!\" But tears were still flooding silently down Ginny\\'s face. \"Where now?\" said Ron, with an anxious look at Ginny. Harry pointed. Fawkes was leading the way, glowing gold along the corridor. They strode after him, and moments later, found themselves outside Professor McGonagall\\'s office. Harry knocked and pushed the door open. CHAPTER EIGHTEEN Dobby\\'s Reward For a moment there was silence as Harry, Ron, Ginny, and Lockhart stood in the doorway, covered in muck and slime and (in Harry\\'s case) blood. Then there was a scream. \"Ginny!\" It was Mrs. Weasley, who had been sitting crying in front of the fire. She leapt to her feet, closely followed by Mr. Weasley, and both of them flung themselves on their daughter. Harry, however, was looking past them. Professor Dumbledore was standing by the mantelpiece, beaming, next to Professor McGonagall, who was taking great, steadying gasps, clutching her chest. Fawkes went whooshing past Harry\\'s ear and settled on Dumbledore\\'s shoulder, just as Harry found himself and Ron being swept into Mrs. Weasley\\'s tight embrace. \"You saved her! You saved her! How did you do it?\" \"I think we\\'d all like to know that,\" said Professor McGonagall weakly. Mrs. Weasley let go of Harry, who hesitated for a moment, then walked over to the desk and laid upon it the Sorting Hat, the ruby-encrusted sword, and what remained of Riddle\\'s diary. Then he started telling them everything. For nearly a quarter of an hour he spoke into the rapt silence: He told them about hearing the disembodied voice, how Hermione had finally realized that he was hearing a basilisk in the pipes; how he and Ron had followed the spiders into the forest, that Aragog had told them where the last victim of the basilisk had died; how he had guessed that Moaning Myrtle had been the victim, and that the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets might be in her bathroom– \"Very well,\" Professor McGonagall prompted him as he paused, \"so you found out where the entrance was - breaking a hundred school rules into pieces along the way, I might add - but how on earth did you all get out of there alive, Potter?\" So Harry, his voice now growing hoarse from all this talking, told them about Fawkes\\'s timely arrival and about the Sorting Hat giving him the sword. But then he faltered. He had so far avoided mentioning Riddle\\'s diary - or Ginny. She was standing with her head against Mrs. Weasley\\'s shoulder, and tears were still coursing silently down her cheeks. What if they expelled her? Harry thought in panic. Riddle\\'s diary didn\\'t work anymore– How could they prove it had been he who\\'d made her do it all? Instinctively, Harry looked at Dumbledore, who smiled faintly, the firelight glancing off his half-moon spectacles. \"What interests me most,\" said Dumbledore gently, \"is how Lord Voldemort managed to enchant Ginny, when my sources tell me he is currently in hiding in the forests of Albania.\" Relief - warm, sweeping, glorious relief Œ swept over Harry. \"W-what\\'s that?\" said Mr. Weasley in a stunned voice. \"You-Know-Who? En-enchant Ginny? But Ginny\\'s not– Ginny hasn\\'t been– has she?\" \"It was this diary,\" said Harry quickly, picking it up and showing it to Dumbledore. \"Riddle wrote it when he was sixteen–\" Dumbledore took the diary from Harry and peered keenly down his long, crooked nose at its burnt and soggy pages. \"Brilliant,\" he said softly. \"Of course, he was probably the most brilliant student Hogwarts has ever seen.\" He turned around to the Weasleys, who were looking utterly bewildered. \"Very few people know that Lord Voldemort was once called Tom Riddle. I taught him myself, fifty years ago, at Hogwarts. He disappeared after leaving the school– traveled far and wide– sank so deeply into the Dark Arts, consorted with the very worst of our kind, underwent so many dangerous, magical transformations, that when he resurfaced as Lord Voldemort, he was barely recognizable. Hardly anyone connected Lord Voldemort with the clever, handsome boy who was once Head Boy here.\" \"But, Ginny,\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"What\\'s our Ginny got to do with - with - him?\" \"His d-diary\" Ginny sobbed. \"I\\'ve b-been writing in it, and he\\'s been w-writing back all year - \" \"Ginny!\" said Mr. Weasley, flabbergasted. \"Haven\\'t I taught you anything. What have I always told you? Never trust anything that can think for itself if you can\\'t see where it keeps its brain? Why didn\\'t you show the diary to me, or your mother? A suspicious object like that, it was clearly full of Dark Magic!\\' \"I d-didn\\'t know,\" sobbed Ginny. \"I found it inside one of the books Mum got me. I th-thought someone had just left it in there and forgotten about it - \" \"Miss Weasley should go up to the hospital wing right away,\" Dumbledore interrupted in a firm voice. \"This has been a terrible ordeal for her. There will be no punishment. Older and wiser wizards than she have been hoodwinked by Lord Voldemort.\" He strode over to the door and opened it. \"Bed rest and perhaps a large, steaming mug of hot chocolate. I always find that cheers me up,\" he added, twinkling kindly down at her. \"You will find that Madam Pomfrey is still awake. She\\'s just giving out Mandrake juice - I daresay the basilisk\\'s victims will be waking up any moment.\" \"So Hermione\\'s okay!\" said Ron brightly. \"There has been no lasting harm done, Ginny,\" said Dumbledore. Mrs. Weasley led Ginny out, and Mr. Weasley followed, still looking deeply shaken. \"You know, Minerva,\" Professor Dumbledore said thoughtfully to Professor McGonagall, \"I think all this merits a good feast. Might I ask you to go and alert the kitchens?\" \"Right,\" said Professor McGonagall crisply, also moving to the door. \"I\\'ll leave you to deal with Potter and Weasley, shall I?\" \"Certainly,\" said Dumbledore. She left, and Harry and Ron gazed uncertainly at Dumbledore. What exactly had Professor McGonagall meant, deal with them? Surely - surely - they weren\\'t about to be punished? \"I seem to remember telling you both that I would have to expel you if you broke any more school rules,\" said Dumbledore. Ron opened his mouth in horror. \"Which goes to show that the best of us must sometimes eat our words,\" Dumbledore went on, smiling. \"You will both receive Special Awards for Services to the School and - let me see - yes, I think two hundred points apiece for Gryffindor.\" Ron went as brightly pink as Lockhart\\'s valentine flowers and closed his mouth again. \"But one of us seems to be keeping mightily quiet about his part in this dangerous adventure,\" Dumbledore added. \"Why so modest, Gilderoy?\" Harry gave a start. He had completely forgotten about Lockhart. He turned and saw that Lockhart was standing in a corner of the room, still wearing his vague smile. When Dumbledore addressed him, Lockhart looked over his shoulder to see who he was talking to. \"Professor Dumbledore,\" Ron said quickly, \"there was an accident down in the Chamber of Secrets. Professor Lockhart - \" \"Am I a professor?\" said Lockhart in mild surprise. \"Goodness. I expect I was hopeless, was I?\" \"He tried to do a Memory Charm and the wand backfired,\" Ron explained quietly to Dumbledore. \"Dear me,\" said Dumbledore, shaking his head, his long silver mustache quivering. \"Impaled upon your own sword, Gilderoy!\" \"Sword?\" said Lockhart dimly. \"Haven\\'t got a sword. That boy has, though.\" He pointed at Harry. \"He\\'ll lend you one.\" \"Would you mind taking Professor Lockhart up to the infirmary, too?\" Dumbledore said to Ron. \"I\\'d like a few more words with Harry–\" Lockhart ambled out. Ron cast a curious look back at Dumbledore and Harry as he closed the door. Dumbledore crossed to one of the chairs by the fire. \"Sit down, Harry,\" he said, and Harry sat, feeling unaccountably nervous. \"First of all, Harry, I want to thank you,\" said Dumbledore, eyes twinkling again. \"You must have shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber. Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you.\" He stroked the phoenix, which had fluttered down onto his knee. Harry grinned awkwardly as Dumbledore watched him. \"And so you met Tom Riddle,\" said Dumbledore thoughtfully. \"I imagine he was most interested in you–\" Suddenly, something that was nagging at Harry came tumbling out of his mouth. \"Professor Dumbledore– Riddle said I\\'m like him. Strange likenesses, he said–\" \"Did he, now?\" said Dumbledore, looking thoughtfully at Harry from under his thick silver eyebrows. \"And what do you think, Harry?\" \"I don\\'t think I\\'m like him!\" said Harry, more loudly than he\\'d intended. \"I mean, I\\'m - I\\'m in Gryffindor, I\\'m–\" But he fell silent, a lurking doubt resurfacing in his mind. \"Professor,\" he started again after a moment. \"The Sorting Hat told me I\\'d - I\\'d have done well in Slytherin. Everyone thought I was Slytherin\\'s heir for a while– because I can speak Parseltongue–\" \"You can speak Parseltongue, Harry,\" said Dumbledore calmly, \"because Lord Voldemort - who is the last remaining ancestor of Salazar Slytherin - can speak Parseltongue. Unless I\\'m much mistaken, he transferred some of his own powers to you the night he gave you that scar. Not something he intended to do, I\\'m sure–\" \"Voldemort put a bit of himself in me?\" Harry said, thunderstruck. \"It certainly seems so.\" \"So I should be in Slytherin,\" Harry said, looking desperately into Dumbledore\\'s face. \"The Sorting Hat could see Slytherin\\'s power in me, and it - \" \"Put you in Gryffindor,\" said Dumbledore calmly. \"Listen to me, Harry. You happen to have many qualities Salazar Slytherin prized in his hand-picked students. His own very rare gift, Parseltongue - resourcefulness - determination - a certain disregard for rules,\" he added, his mustache quivering again. \"Yet the Sorting Hat placed you in Gryffindor. You know why that was. Think.\" \"It only put me in Gryffindor,\" said Harry in a defeated voice, \"because I asked not to go in Slytherin–\" \"Exactly, \"said Dumbledore, beaming once more. \"Which makes you very different from Tom Riddle. It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.\" Harry sat motionless in his chair, stunned. \"If you want proof, Harry, that you belong in Gryffindor, I suggest you look more closely at this.\" Dumbledore reached across to Professor McGonagall\\'s desk, picked up the blood-stained silver sword, and handed it to Harry. Dully, Harry turned it over, the rubies blazing in the firelight. And then he saw the name engraved just below the hilt. Godric Gryffindor \"Only a true Gryffindor could have pulled that out of the hat, Harry,\" said Dumbledore simply. For a minute, neither of them spoke. Then Dumbledore pulled open one of the drawers in Professor McGonagall\\'s desk and took out a quill and a bottle of ink. \"What you need, Harry, is some food and sleep. I suggest you go down to the feast, while I write to Azkaban - we need our gamekeeper back. And I must draft an advertisement for the Daily Prophet, too,\" he added Thoughtfully. \"We\\'ll be needing a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher– Dear me, we do seem to run through them, don\\'t we?\" Harry got up and crossed to the door. He had just reached for the handle, however, when the door burst open so violently that it bounced back off the wall. Lucius Malfoy stood there, fury in his face. And cowering behind his legs, heavily wrapped in bandages, was Dobby. \"Good evening, Lucius,\" said Dumbledore pleasantly. Mr. Malfoy almost knocked Harry over as he swept into the room. Dobby went scurrying in after him, crouching at the hem of his cloak, a look of abject terror on his face. The elf was carrying a stained rag with which he was attempting to finish cleaning Mr. Malfoys shoes. Apparently Mr. Malfoy had set out in a great hurry, for not only were his shoes half-polished, but his usually sleek hair was disheveled. Ignoring the elf bobbing apologetically around his ankles, he fixed his cold eyes upon Dumbledore. \"So!\" he said \"You\\'ve come back. The governors suspended you, but you still saw fit to return to Hogwarts.\" \"Well, you see, Lucius,\" said Dumbledore, smiling serenely, \"the other eleven governors contacted me today. It was something like being caught in a hailstorm of owls, to tell the truth. They\\'d heard that Arthur Weasleys daughter had been killed and wanted me back here at once. They seemed to think I was the best man for the job after all. Very strange tales they told me, too– Several of them seemed to think that you had threatened to curse their families if they didn\\'t agree to suspend me in the first place.\" Mr. Malfoy went even paler than usual, but his eyes were still slits of fury. \"So - have you stopped the attacks yet?\" he sneered. \"Have you caught the culprit?\" \"We have,\" said Dumbledore, with a smile. \"Well?\" said Mr. Malfoy sharply. \"Who is it?\" \"The same person as last time, Lucius,\" said Dumbledore. \"But this time, Lord Voldemort was acting through somebody else. By means of this diary.\" He held up the small black book with the large hole through the center, watching Mr. Malfoy closely. Harry, however, was watching Dobby. The elf was doing something very odd. His great eyes fixed meaningfully on Harry, he kept pointing at the diary, then at Mr. Malfoy, and then hitting himself hard on the head with his fist. \"I see–\" said Mr. Malfoy slowly to Dumbledore. \"A clever plan,\" said Dumbledore in a level voice, still staring Mr. Malfoy straight in the eye. \"Because if Harry here - \" Mr. Malfoy shot Harry a swift, sharp look \"and his friend Ron hadn\\'t discovered this book, why - Ginny Weasley might have taken all the blame. No one would ever have been able to prove she hadn\\'t acted of her own free will–\" Mr. Malfoy said nothing. His face was suddenly masklike. \"And imagine,\" Dumbledore went on, \"what might have happened then– The Weasleys are one of our most prominent pure-blood families. Imagine the effect on Arthur Weasley and his Muggle Protection Act, if his own daughter was discovered attacking and - killing Muggle-borns– Very fortunate the diary was discovered, and Riddle\\'s memories wiped from it. Who knows what the consequences might have been otherwise–\" Mr. Malfoy forced himself to speak. \"Very fortunate,\" he said stiffly. And still, behind his back, Dobby was pointing, first to the diary, then to Lucius Malfoy, then punching himself in the head. And Harry suddenly understood. He nodded at Dobby, and Dobby backed into a corner, now twisting his ears in punishment. \"Don\\'t you want to know how Ginny got hold of that diary, Mr. Malfoy?\" said Harry. Lucius Malfoy rounded on him. \"How should I know how the stupid little girl got hold of it?\" he said. \"Because you gave it to her,\" said Harry. \"In Flourish and Blotts. You picked up her old Transfiguration book and slipped the diary inside it, didn\\'t you?\" He saw Mr. Malfoy\\'s white hands clench and unclench. \"Prove it,\" he hissed. \"Oh, no one will be able to do that,\" said Dumbledore, smiling at Harry. \"Not now that Riddle has vanished from the book. On the other hand, I would advise you, Lucius, not to go giving out any more of Lord Voldemort\\'s old school things. If any more of them find their way into innocent hands, I think Arthur Weasley, for one, will make sure they are traced back to you–\" Lucius Malfoy stood for a moment, and Harry distinctly saw his right hand twitch as though he was longing to reach for his wand. Instead, he turned to his house-elf. \"We\\'re going, Dobby!\" He wrenched open the door and as the elf came hurrying up to him, he kicked him right through it. They could hear Dobby squealing with pain all the way along the corridor. Harry stood for a moment, thinking hard. Then it came to him - \"Professor Dumbledore,\" he said hurriedly. \"Can I give that diary back to Mr. Malfoy, please?\" \"Certainly, Harry,\" said Dumbledore calmly. \"But hurry. The feast, remember–\" Harry grabbed the diary and dashed out of the office. He could hear Dobby\\'s squeals of pain receding around the corner. Quickly, wondering if this plan could possibly work, Harry took off one of his shoes, pulled off his slimy, filthy sock, and stuffed the diary into it. Then he ran down the dark corridor. He caught up with them at the top of the stairs. \"Mr. Malfoy,\" he gasped, skidding to a halt, \"I\\'ve got something for you - \" And he forced the smelly sock into Lucius Malfoy\\'s hand. \"What the - ?\" Mr. Malfoy ripped the sock off the diary, threw it aside, then looked furiously from the ruined book to Harry. \"You\\'ll meet the same sticky end as your parents one of these days, Harry Potter,\" he said softly. \"They were meddlesome fools, too.\" He turned to go. \"Come, Dobby. I said, come.\" But Dobby didn\\'t move. He was holding up Harry\\'s disgusting, slimy sock, and looking at it as though it were a priceless treasure. \"Master has given a sock,\" said the elf in wonderment. \"Master gave it to Dobby.\" \"What\\'s that?\" spat Mr. Malfoy. \"What did you say?\" \"Got a sock,\" said Dobby in disbelief. \"Master threw it, and Dobby caught it, and Dobby - Dobby is free.\" Lucius Malfoy stood frozen, staring at the elf then he lunged at Harry. \"You\\'ve lost me my servant, boy!\" But Dobby shouted, \"You shall not harm Harry Potter!\" There was a loud bang, and Mr. Malfoy was thrown backward. He crashed down the stairs, three at a time, landing in a crumpled heap on the landing below. He got up, his face livid, and pulled out his wand, but Dobby raised a long, threatening finger. \"You shall go now,\" he said fiercely, pointing down at Mr. Malfoy. \"You shall not touch Harry Potter. You shall go now.\" Lucius Malfoy had no choice. With a last, incensed stare at the pair of them, he swung his cloak around him and hurried out of sight. \"Harry Potter freed Dobby!\" said the elf shrilly, gazing up at Harry, moonlight from the nearest window reflected in his orb-like eyes. \"Harry Potter set Dobby free!\" \"Least I could do, Dobby,\" said Harry, grinning. \"Just promise never to try and save my life again.\" The elf\\'s ugly brown face split suddenly into a wide, toothy smile. \"I\\'ve just got one question, Dobby,\" said Harry as Dobby pulled on Harry\\'s sock with shaking hands. \"You told me all this had nothing to do with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, remember? Well - \" \"It was a clue, sir,\" said Dobby, his eyes widening, as though this was obvious. \"Was giving you a clue. The Dark Lord, before he changed his name, could be freely named, you see?\" \"Right,\" said Harry weakly. \"Well, I\\'d better go. There\\'s a feast, and my friend Hermione should be awake by now–\" Dobby threw his arms around Harry\\'s middle and hugged him. \"Harry Potter is greater by far than Dobby knew!\" he sobbed. \"Farewell, Harry Potter!\" And with a final loud crack, Dobby disappeared. Harry had been to several Hogwarts feasts, but never one quite like this. Everybody was in their pajamas, and the celebration lasted all night. Harry didn\\'t know whether the best bit was Hermione running toward him, screaming \"You solved it! You solved it!\" or Justin hurrying over from the Hufflepuff table to wring. his hand and apologize endlessly for suspecting him, or Hagrid turning up at half past three, cuffing Harry and Ron so hard on the shoulders that they were knocked into their plates of trifle, or his and Ron\\'s four hundred points for Gryffindor securing the House Cup for the second year running, or Professor McGonagall standing up to tell them all that the exams had been canceled as a school treat (\"Oh, no!\" said Hermione), or Dumbledore announcing that, unfortunately, Professor Lockhart would be unable to return next year, owing to the fact that he needed to go away and get his memory back. Quite a few of the teachers joined in the cheering that greeted this news. \"Shame,\" said Ron, helping himself to a jam doughnut. \"He has starting to grow on me.\" The rest of the final term passed in a haze of blazing sunshine. Hogwarts was back to normal with only a few, small differences - Defense Against the Dark Arts classes were canceled (\"but we\\'ve had plenty of practice at that anyway,\" Ron told a disgruntled Hermione) and Lucius Malfoy had been sacked as a school governor. Draco was no longer strutting around the school as though he owned the place. On the contrary, he looked resentful and sulky. On the other hand, Ginny Weasley was perfectly happy again. Too soon, it was time for the journey home on the Hogwarts Express. Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Ginny got a compartment to themselves. They made the most of the last few hours in which they were allowed to do magic before the holidays. They played Exploding Snap, set off the very last of Fred and George\\'s Filibuster fireworks, and practiced disarming each other by magic. Harry was getting very good at it. They were almost at King\\'s Cross when Harry remembered something. \"Ginny Œ what did you see Percy doing, that he didn\\'t want you to tell anyone?\" \"Oh, that,\" said Ginny, giggling. \"Well - Percy\\'s got a girlfriend.\" Fred dropped a stack of books on George\\'s head. \"What?\" \"It\\'s that Ravenclaw prefect, Penelope Clearwater,\" said Ginny. \"That\\'s who he was writing to all last summer. He\\'s been meeting her all over the school in secret. I walked in on them kissing in an empty classroom one day. He was so upset when she was - you know - attacked. You won\\'t tease him, will you?\" she added anxiously. \"Wouldn\\'t dream of it,\" said Fred, who was looking like his birthday had come early. \"Definitely not,\" said George, sniggering. The Hogwarts Express slowed and finally stopped. Harry pulled out his quill and a bit of parchment and turned to Ron and Hermione. \"This is called a telephone number,\" he told Ron, scribbling it twice, tearing the parchment in two, and handing it to them. \"I told your dad how to use a telephone last summer - he\\'ll know. Call me at the Dursleys\\', okay? I can\\'t stand another two months with only Dudley to talk to–\" \"Your aunt and uncle will be proud, though, won\\'t they?\" said Hermione as they got off the train and joined the crowd thronging toward the enchanted barrier. \"When they hear what you did this year?\" \"Proud?\" said Harry. \"Are you crazy? All those times I could\\'ve died, and I didn\\'t manage it? They\\'ll be furious–\" And together they walked back through the gateway to the Muggle world. ']\n"
