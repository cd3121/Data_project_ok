            <p class="body-text">A few weeks ago, Netflix announced news that shook up die-hard TV series fans: the disappearance, in 2020, of two entertainment giants from its catalogue, The Office and Friends.</p>
            <p class="body-text">Both have helped to make American humour a concept that is recognized around the world. Better yet, both have created characters so emblematic, so powerful, so well written, that they continue to live in the hearts of fans long after the end of the sitcom.</p>
            <p class="body-text">The Office' closed its doors in 2013 after 9 seasons of good and loyal service, and yet it is still Netflix's most watched series today. A new generation has become addicted to the show through streaming, while Friends has maintained a similar cult since its arrival in streaming. These two shows were the most watched on Netflix last year in terms of minutes spent watching.</p>
            <p class="body-text">Michael Scott has become so emblematic that he remains forever linked to this joke known as "That's what she said". This is a joke phrase, a sort of automatic punchline that turns an innocent piece of speech into startling and humorous innuendo. By joking on it again and again, Michael Scott introduced 'That's what she said' into the legend.</p>

      <p class="body-text">Michael is not only the one who makes the most biased jokes, he holds the record for the one who intervenes most often in all seasons combined. This is impressive given that he leaves the series along the way (in season 7). But this figure proves that Michael Scott's character is the backbone of the serie.</p>
